You can define thresholds for more than 120 metrics, including the following:\n\u2022 Physical Reads Per Sec\n\u2022 User Commits Per Sec\n\u2022 SQL Service Response Time\nExcept for the Tablespace Space Usage metric, which is database related, the other metrics are\ninstance related. Threshold alerts are also referred to as stateful alerts, which are automatically\ncleared when an alert condition clears. Stateful alerts appear in DBA_OUTSTANDING_ALERTS and,\nwhen cleared, go to DBA_ALERT_HISTORY.\nOther server-generated alerts correspond to specific database events, such as ORA-* errors,\n\u201cSnapshot too old\u201d errors, Recovery Area Low On Free Space, and Resumable Session Suspended.\nThese are non-threshold-based alerts, also referred to as stateless alerts. Stateless alerts go directly to the History table"

However, other alerts (such as generic alert log errors) are sent to you for notification and must be acknowledged by you. After taking the corrective measures, you acknowledge an alert by clearing or purging it. Clearing an alert sends  the alert to the Alert History which is accessible from Monitoring sub menu. Purging an alert removes it from the Alert History."

Defining the scope of the problem The scope of the solution must match the scope of the problem. Consider a problem at the database level and a problem at the statement level. For example, the shared pool is too small, which causes cursors to age out quickly, which in turn causes many hard parses. Using an initialization parameter to increase the shared pool size fixes the problem at the database level and improves performance for all sessions. However, if a single SQL statement is not using a helpful index, then changing the optimizer initialization parameters for the entire database could harm overall performance. If a single SQL statement has a problem, then an appropriately scoped solution addresses just this problem with this statement."

We (DBAs) should work with users, to help achieve their requirements. However, we can be proactive outside of this. Just because a user is happy - doesn't mean we can't make them \"happier\" by doing tuning activities before things get bad. So, neither of these should be true.\nD is incorrect, memory is much less likely to be a culprit of an issue, than a filesystem I/O issue.\nE is correct. We should never try to tune a file system first. If we make a file system change that fixes one SQL statement - it might harm a different SQL statement. However, if we tune the first SQL statement, it will have no impact on the rest of the system. Therefore, we should try to tune \"bad SQL\" first.\nF is incorrect - the alert log gives us little/no information to do with tuning.\n\nSo, AE are correct."

BACKUP VALIDATE of a backup performs the same disk reads as a real backup but performs no I/O to an output device.\nD -&gt; If the time for the BACKUP VALIDATE to tape is about the same as the time for a real backup to tape, then reading from disk is the likely bottleneck.\nC -&gt; If the time for the BACKUP VALIDATE to tape is significantly less than the time for a real backup to tape, then writing to the output device is the likely bottleneck.\nB -&gt; Some operating systems support native asynchronous I/O. If and only if your disk does not support asynchronous I/O, then set DBWR_IO_SLAVES. Any nonzero value for DBWR_IO_SLAVES causes a fixed number of disk I/O slaves to be used for backup and restore, which simulates asynchronous I/O.\n\nG -&gt; incorrect - The simplest way to identify the bottleneck is to find the data file that has the largest ratio for LONG_WAITS divided by IO_COUNT"

If you run a shutdown abort you can clearly see in the alert log that the application of redo logs starts when the database is mounted after running the startup command and then the database is opened after it confirms that the undo tablespace is available. Then the undo is applied to rollback the database to a consistent state it was in before the unclean shutdown. So C is definitely true but B and F are both technically false as they ignore that Instance Recovery has two phases. Not sure if the Q is wrong on here but I would say that F is more true as IR starts when the DB is mounted, but it opens when rollforward is done, not when IR is completed."

Undo data for multiple PDBs may be mixed within the undo tablespaces and even within individual data blocks. Therefore, to perform a flashback database operation for a PDB, RMAN automatically uses an auxiliary instance to restore shared undo tablespaces and certain tablespaces in the root and then recovers data to the required point in time. This process may involve restoring backups for a relatively small amount of data. When you perform a flashback database operation on a PDB to a clean PDB restore point, no auxiliary instance or restoring of backups is required.\n\nBy default, the auxiliary instance is created in the FRA. You can use the AUXILIARY DESTINATION clause in the FLASHBACK DATABASE command to specify an alternate location for the auxiliary instance.\n\nHere in this question AUXILIARY DESTINATION clause is omitted(which is optional) so this RMAN command from CDB$ROOT will execute."

RMAN automatically restores from backup any archived redo log files that are needed and recovers the database to make it consistent. RMAN never flashes back data for temporary tablespaces.\n\nThe earliest SCN that can be used for a Flashback Database operation depends on the setting of the DB_FLASHBACK_RETENTION_TARGET initialization parameter, and on the actual retention of flashback logs permitted by available disk.

This can't be correct.\nD - This used to be the answer, with older server architecture (and spinning disks!). I, once, brought a batch job down from 6 hours runtime, to 14 minutes, merely by exporting the main table - and reimporting it back into a single extent (in Oracle 9i). Modern storage arrays shouldn't care so much about this.\nE - Savepoints don't degrade performance, it's the use of rollback that does.\n\nSince BCE can't be the answer, maybe D is the second correct one.\n\nSo, AD for me."
