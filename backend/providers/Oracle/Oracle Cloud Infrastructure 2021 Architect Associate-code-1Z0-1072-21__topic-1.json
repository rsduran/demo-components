As CFD continues to grow in popularity, especially in the cloud, it needs a robust and performant infrastructure. By moving this tightly coupled MPI-based workload to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), you can benefit from Oracle\u2019s RDMA Cluster Networking and some of the most high-performing instances in the cloud .d with RDMA RoCE v2 networking. These Compute nodes can either be BM.Optimized3.36 or BM.HPC2.36 because they\u2019re ideal for workloads that require the highest single threaded performance. With the cluster, you can also attach block volumes at 32k IOPS per volume on top of the NVME SSD storage that comes with these shapes to hold all of your data"
