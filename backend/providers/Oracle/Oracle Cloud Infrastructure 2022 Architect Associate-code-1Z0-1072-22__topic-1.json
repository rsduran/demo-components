To make your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure hosted zone accessible through the internet, you must delegate your domain with your domain's registrar. You can use the noted name servers provided by OCI DNS to change your domain's DNS delegation. The registrar's documentation will provide instructions on how to delegate your domain to OCI DNS. FastConnect partners are one of the options to establish a dedicated network connection to OCI, which can include DNS services like OCI DNS [7].\n\nThe other options listed (A, B, C, and D) are not correct based on the information provided from the internet sources and the context of DNS management with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure."
