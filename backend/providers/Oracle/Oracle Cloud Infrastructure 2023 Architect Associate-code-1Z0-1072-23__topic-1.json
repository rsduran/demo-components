The explanation is that CPE is an object in OCI that represents your on-premises router or VPN device that connects to your VCN via a site-to-site VPN. A site-to-site VPN is a secure and encrypted connection between your on-premises network and your VCN over the public internet. To set up a site-to-site VPN, you need to create a CPE object with your router's public IP address and other information, such as vendor and platform. You also need to create a Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) object in your VCN and attach it to your VCN. Then, you need to create an IPSec connection between your CPE and DRG, which will create two redundant VPN tunnels for high availability."

Auth Tokens are short-lived and can be generated and used for authentication without exposing the actual user credentials.\nOption B (API Signing Key) is related to signature-based authentication and is not suitable for third-party APIs that do not support OCI's signature-based authentication.\n\nOption C (SSH Key Pair with 2048-bit algorithm) is not typically used for API authentication in OCI.\n\nOption D (OCI Username and Password) is not recommended for security reasons. Using passwords directly in the application poses security risks, and it's generally better to use more secure authentication mechanisms like Auth Tokens.\n\nTherefore, for compatibility with third-party APIs and avoiding signature-based authentication, Auth Tokens are the appropriate choice."
