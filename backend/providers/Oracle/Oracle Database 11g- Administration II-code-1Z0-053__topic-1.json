This will cause the recovery to occur the next time ASM is started. If any database instance is connected to an ASM instance, the database instance will also be aborted.\nNote: When there is a connected RDBMS instance, the closing of the NORMAL, IMMEDIATE, and TRANSACTIONAL forms is not applied, and the following error is returned:\nSQL&gt; shutdown\nORA-15097: cannot SHUTDOWN ASM instance with connected client (process 14372)"
