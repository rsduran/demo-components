On operating systems that do not support native asynchronous I/O, the database can simulate it with special I/O slave processes that are dedicated to performing I/O on behalf of another process. You can control disk I/O slaves by setting the DBWR_IO_SLAVES parameter to a nonzero value. The database allocates four backup disk I/O slaves for any nonzero value of DBWR_IO_SLAVES. By contrast, tape I/O is always synchronous. For tape I/O, each channel allocated (whether manually or based on a CONFIGURE command) corresponds to a server process, called here a channel process.\n\nIf LARGE_POOL_SIZE is set, then the database attempts to get memory from the large pool. If this value is not large enough, then an error is recorded in the alert log, the database does not try to get buffers from the shared pool, and asynchronous I/O is not used. \n\nIf LARGE_POOL_SIZE is not set, then the database attempts to get memory from the shared pool. \n\nThe RATE parameter on a channel is intended to reduce, rather than increase, backup throughput, so that more disk bandwidth is available for other database operations."

(1) Create the column groups<br>At this point you can get Oracle to automatically create the column groups for each of the tables based on the usage information captured during the monitoring window. You simply have to call the DBMS_STATS.CREATE_EXTENDED_STATS function for each table.This function requires just two arguments, the schema name and the table name. From then on, statistics will be maintained for each column group whenever statistics are gathered on the table.<br>Note:<br>* DBMS_STATS.REPORT_COL_USAGE reports column usage information and records all the SQL operations the database has processed for a given object.<br>* The Oracle SQL optimizer has always been ignorant of the implied relationships between data columns within the same table.

For example, if you install Oracle Restart onto a host on which a database is already running, you can use SRVCTL to add that database to the Oracle Restart configuration.

The Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) Compare Periods report enables you to compare database performance between two periods of time.<br>While an AWR report shows AWR data between two snapshots (or two points in time), the AWR Compare Periods report shows the difference between two periods (or two AWR reports with a total of four snapshots). Using the AWR Compare Periods report helps you to identify detailed performance attributes and configuration settings that differ between two time periods.<br>Reference:<br>Resolving Performance Degradation Over Time",

In this case the metadata from the source database is exported to a dump file, and both the dump file and the tablespace data files are transferred to a new system. The steps would be as follows:<br>* (1) Set user tablespaces in the source database to READ ONLY.<br>* (3) Create a CDB on the destination system, including a PDB into which you will import the source database.<br>* (4) From the Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2.0.3) environment, export the metadata and any data residing in administrative tablespaces from the source database using the FULL=Y and TRANSPORTABLE=ALWAYS parameters. Note that the VERSION=12 parameter is required only when exporting from an<br>Oracle Database 11g Release 2 database.<br>* (5) Copy the tablespace data files from the source system to the destination system.<br>* (6) In the Oracle Database 12c environment, connect to the pre-created PDB and import the dump file.<br>References:<br>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/upgrade/upgrading-oracle-database-wp-12c-1896123.pdf<br>, page 11",

The purpose of this feature is to automatically improve plans for queries that are executed repeatedly, for which the optimizer does not estimate cardinalities in the plan properly. The optimizer may misestimate cardinalities for a variety of reasons, such as missing or inaccurate statistics, or complex predicates. Whatever the reason for the misestimate, cardinality feedback may be able to help.",

To do so, start the instance with the following declaration in the initialization parameter file: enable_pluggable_database=TRUE<br>A: To duplicate PDBs, you must create the auxiliary instance as a CDB. To do so, start the instance with the declaration enable_pluggable_database=TRUE in the initialization parameter file. When you duplicate one or more PDBs, RMAN also duplicates the root (CDB$ROOT) and the seed database (PDB$SEED). The resulting duplicate database is a fully functional CDB that contains the root, the seed database, and the duplicated PDBs.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/BRADV/rcmdupdb.htm",
