The join condition would have to be an equijoin. If it is not there is another name for the join and it's called non equijoins. I guess a self non equijoin would be possible but this goes against the point I'm making. A self join is joining the same table to itself ON a condition and that is why it has to be an equijoin.\n\nFor example the left outer joined table would show all the rows from the left and unmatched rows on the right filled with nulls where there was no matches. I don't think in self joins there would be any unmatched rows due to a missing column on the right.\n\nAn outer self join is not possible because it's the same table your joining. Again, you can force a outer self join but this is more of an outer join than a self join."

Unlike traditional space management with a fixed relink and unlink threshold, bitmap space managements allow Oracle to compare the actual row space for an INSERT with the actual available space on the data block. This enables better reuse of the available free space especially for objects with rows of highly varying size. Here are the values inside the four-bit space:\nValue \tMeaning\n0000 \tUnformatted Block\n0001 \tBlock is logically full\n0010 \t&lt;25% free space\n0011 \t&gt;25% but &lt;50% free space\n0100 \t&gt; 50% but &lt;75% free space\n0101 \t&gt;75% free space\n\nTable 1: Bitmap value meanings."

If a block has sufficient free space to accomodate the row update then Oracle does not need to search for a different block with enough free space.\nD is correct. Oracle does this by scanning the BMB in the segment to determine a block that can store the entire row.  The main purpose here is to avoid row chanining.\nE is wrong. It all depends what the PCTFREE value is for the segment.

Can be set with the incative_account_time of the profile.\nC is wrong. When the CPU limit has been reached the account is not locked, but rather the session receives either an ORA-02392 or an ORA-02393 errors.\nD is correct.

A select for update clause obtains a transaction lock TX, which is one of the three conditions under which transactions will implicitly begin.\nB is wrong.

Issues with both the MONTHS_BETWEEN function (wrong usage and argument order) and the NEXT_DAY function (second argument should be a day name).\nD is wrong. Not because of the usage but because of the Day returned. Using a \"1\" as the second argument in the NEXT_DAY function it returns a Sunday date and not the first Monday. Looking at the official Oracle documentation the second argument should be character (day name) only. \"The argument char must be a day of the week in the date language of your session, either the full name or the abbreviation.\" Just goes to show that 1, Oracle documentation is never 100% complete and 2, test test test if you are not sure."

Oracle does not support taking substrings directly from DATE data types. The date must be converted to a string using TO_CHAR before SUBSTR can be used. Furthermore, subtracting 10 from a substring of a date does not make sense unless the substring represents a number, which is not the case here since join_date is a date and not a string of numbers. Therefore, explicit conversion is necessary, and the query itself is somewhat nonsensical without additional context or correction. This makes Option D the most clearly incorrect and the one that certainly requires explicit data type conversion to even make sense as a SQL statement."
