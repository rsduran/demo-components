This means that if you have a method that works with an object of a particular class, you can also use that method with objects of other classes that inherit from that class or implement the same interface.

While a class with a public static void main(String[] args) method is required to be the entry point for a Java application, not all public classes need to have a main method.\n\nF. Methods and fields are optional components of a class.\nThis statement is incorrect. In Java, a class must have at least one constructor (which can be the default constructor) and can contain methods and fields, but a class must have a constructor to initialize its instances."

Data abstraction is a concept in OOP that refers to the process of hiding implementation details while only showing the functionality to the user. It is achieved in Java by using abstract classes and interfaces, which define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits from them . Encapsulation, on the other hand, is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class. By using encapsulation, a class can enforce its own data validation rules and ensure that its internal state remains consistent ."
