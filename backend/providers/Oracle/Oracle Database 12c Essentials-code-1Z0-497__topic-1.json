        "content": "A: In the Oracle Database architecture, a CDB (Container Database) is a collection of one or more PDBs (Pluggable Databases). The CDB contains a root container, which holds the Oracle-supplied metadata for the entire CDB, and one or more PDBs, which are user-created and hold the application-specific data. Because the Oracle-supplied metadata is specific to the entire CDB, it is stored in the root container, which is the only place it can reside. The other options in the question are not necessarily true."
