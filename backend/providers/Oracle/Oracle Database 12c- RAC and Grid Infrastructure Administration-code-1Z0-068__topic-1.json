The set consists of one template for each file type (data file, control file, redo log file, and so on) that is supported by Oracle ASM. For example, a template named ONLINELOG provides the default file redundancy and striping attributes for all redo log files written to Oracle ASM disks.

So, by default, the REMOTE_LISTENER parameter is set to the SCAN, assuming that the Database is created using standard Oracle tools. This enables the instances to register with the SCAN Listeners as remote listeners to provide information on what services are being provided by the instance, the current load, and a recommendation on how many incoming connections should be directed to the instance.<br>Note: Single Client Access Name (SCAN) is an Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) feature that provides a single name for clients to access Oracle<br>Databases running in a cluster.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: You must set the LOCAL_LISTENER parameter to the node-VIP. If you need fully qualified domain names, then ensure that the LOCAL_LISTENER parameter is set to the fully qualified domain name. By default, a node listener is created on each node in the cluster during cluster configuration. With Oracle Grid<br>Infrastructure, the node listener runs out of the Oracle Grid Infrastructure home and listens on the node-VIP using the specified port.<br>D: LOAD_BALANCE=on, not LOAD_BALANCE=YES, is used.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/JJDBC/scan.htm#JJDBC29151 https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RACAD/hafeats.htm#RACAD7122",

When the connection to an instance is lost, SESSION failover results only in the establishment of a new connection to another Oracle RAC node; any work in progress is lost. SESSION failover is ideal for online transaction processing (OLTP) systems, where transactions are small.<br>C: SELECT failover. With SELECT failover, Oracle Net keeps track of all SELECT statements issued during the transaction, tracking how many rows have been fetched back to the client for each cursor associated with a SELECT statement. If the connection to the instance is lost, Oracle Net establishes a connection to another Oracle RAC node and re-executes the SELECT statements, repositioning the cursors so the client can continue fetching rows as if nothing has happened.<br>The SELECT failover approach is best for data warehouse systems that perform complex and time-consuming transactions.<br>D: Oracle's answer to application failover is a new Oracle Net mechanism dubbed Transparent Application Failover. TAF allows the DBA to configure the type and method of failover for each Oracle Net client.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>E: In PRECONNECT failover, the application simultaneously connects to both a primary and a backup node. This offers faster failover, because a pre-spawned connection is ready to use. But the extra connection adds everyday overhead by duplicating connections.<br>References:<br>http://www.dba-oracle.com/art_oramag_rac_taf.htm",

When one instance leaves the cluster, the GRD of that instance needs to be redistributed to the surviving nodes. RAC uses an algorithm called lazy remastering to remaster only a minimal number of resources during a reconfiguration.<br>D: Using the SHUTDOWN TRANSACTIONAL command with the LOCAL option is useful to shut down a particular Oracle RAC database instance. Transactions on other instances do not block this operation.<br>C: Recovery from instance failure is automatic, requiring no DBA intervention. In case of instance failure, a surviving instance can read the redo logs of the failed instance.<br>For example, when using the Oracle Parallel Server, another instance performs instance recovery for the failed instance. In single-instance configurations, Oracle performs crash recovery for a database when the database is restarted, that is, mounted and opened to a new instance. The transition from a mounted state to an open state automatically triggers crash recovery, if necessary.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: After a NORMAL or IMMEDIATE shutdown, instance recovery is not required.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RACAD/admin.htm#RACAD8910",
