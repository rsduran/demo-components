As explained in previous chapters, managed servers\nmaintain copies of certain information that are centrally kept in the administration\nserver, such as the main domain configuration repository3 and the contents of the\nembedded LDAP.\n\nUpon starting, managed servers will contact the administration server\nto obtain a fresh copy of those artifacts. Therefore, it is sufficient to back up managed\nservers by exporting their configuration using the pack command with the managed\noption"
