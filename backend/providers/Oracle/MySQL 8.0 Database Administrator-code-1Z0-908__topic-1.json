The master is producing a large volume of events in parallel but the slave is processing them serially.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. When the \"Seconds_Behind_Master\" value is steadily growing, it indicates that the slave is falling behind the master because it's waiting for data from the master. This can happen if the master is busy and cannot transmit data to the slave as quickly as the slave can process it.\n\nD. If the master is producing a large volume of events (changes) in parallel, but the slave is processing them serially (one by one), it can lead to a situation where the slave falls behind the master. The slave might not be able to keep up with the incoming changes, causing the \"Seconds_Behind_Master\" value to increase."

In a situation where there is a network partition, the remaining nodes are not able to tell if the unreachable servers have crashed or whether a network partition has isolated these nodes alone and therefore the group cannot be reconfigured automatically1. This could potentially lead to both a 2 node and 3 node group replication still running.\nE. A manual intervention to force group members to be only the working two instances is required. When a majority of group members is lost, the group is unable to progress and blocks because it cannot secure majority or quorum1. In this case, manual intervention may be required to reconfigure the group with only the working instances.\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication-network-partitioning.html"
