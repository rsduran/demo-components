In such a scenario, Product would be a base dimension while Ounces and Flavor would be attribute dimensions.<br>A varying attribute enables you to track two values in relation to a third dimension called an independent dimension. You could, for example, track your product in eight ounces over a year.In this scenario, Time is the independent dimension. The value of this third factor can vary (hence the name). For example, you could track your product over a year, a quarter, or a month.<br>References:",
