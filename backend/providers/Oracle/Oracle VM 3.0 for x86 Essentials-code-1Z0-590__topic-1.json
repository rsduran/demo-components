Paravirtualization provides hooks for guest instructions so that complicated tasks can be performed by the host instead of the virtual machine, where performance is worse.<br>Paravirtualization requires that the guest kernel is ported to be made aware of the virtual environment.",

Several iterations of these extensions have been introduced in the last decade or so, collectively known as Intel VT and AMD-V and development continues. The technology is now prevalent; all recent servers, many desktops and some mobile systems should be equipped with at least some extensions."
