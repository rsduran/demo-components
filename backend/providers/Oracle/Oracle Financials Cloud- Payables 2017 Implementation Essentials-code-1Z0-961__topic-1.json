On the Manage Corporate Card Usage Policies page, you can define the allowable amount for each expense category that can be charged as a cash expense. Above this allowable amount, employees are required to use their corporate cards. Employees who exceed the allowable limit receive a warning message, while completing expense entry, that reminds them to use the corporate card or an error message that actually prevents submission of the expense report. The application also notifies the auditor and manager of the policy violations. Alternatively, if no limits are defined, Expenses allows you to submit cash expenses of any amount."
