If you need to change just one value like a region it is quite an overhead.\n\nTo change just one or two values of your DEFAULT configuration, you can use OCI CLI environment variables. These environment variables override the values specified in the DEFAULT profile, but do not change any value in the $HOME/.oci/config file.\n\nSo, for example, to list all compartments you own in your subscribed regions, you can just use the OCI_CLI_REGION environment variable like this: rgs=\"us-ashburn-1 eu-frankfurt-1 ap-sydney-1\" for i in $rgs; do export OCI_CLI_REGION=$i echo \"Compartments in region $OCI_CLI_REGION\" oci iam compartment list done This loop uses the same OCI CLI command line and the DEFAULT profile, overrides the region setting, and returns different results for the regions you need.\n\nhttps://www.ateam-oracle.com/post/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-cli-scripting-how-to-quickly-override-the-default-configuration"
