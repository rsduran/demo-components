        "content": "Correct Answer ABD - The pick release of the requisition movement request allocates the project material prior to allocation of common inventory.\nYou can create shipment lines with the project and task specified to indicate the project costing preference. You can specify the project and task even if they're not valid in the shipping organization or if you haven't enabled the shipping organization for projects. You can manage and process the lines with the same costing project and task together.\nYou can also use Quick Ship to bypass pick release and pick confirm, and ship the material from either project inventory or common inventory."
