Source Oracle Single Instance Databases can be migrated to Oracle RAC Databases with Oracle ZDM.\nOracle ZDM supports migration from single-instance databases to Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) databases, allowing for scalability and high availability on the target environment.\n\nB. When migrating with Oracle ZDM, if the target database is at a higher patch level than the source database, the datapatch utility runs on the target database as a postmigration task.\nThis is true because Oracle ZDM handles patch level differences, and if the target has a higher patch level, ZDM will automatically run the datapatch utility on the target database as part of the post-migration tasks to ensure consistency."
