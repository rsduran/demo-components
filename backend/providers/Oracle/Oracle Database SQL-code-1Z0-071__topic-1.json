Setting a column to unused does not immediately delete its data; it only marks the column as unavailable.\n\nOption C: \"Once a column has been set to unused, a new column with the same name can be added to the table.\"\nThis is correct. Once a column is marked as unused, you can add a new column with the same name to the table, because the unused column is effectively 'removed' from the table\u2019s structure in a logical sense."

The data stored in a regular table is not private to any session and can be accessed by any session with the appropriate privileges.\n\nIn summary, the main differences between a global temporary table and a regular table are:\n\nA global temporary table holds data only for the duration of a session or transaction, while a regular table holds data permanently.\nData stored in a global temporary table is private to the session, while data stored in a regular table is not private to any session."

Matched rows are those that satisfy the join condition, while unmatched rows are those that do not have a matching row in the other table.\n\nB. Option B is true. Outer joins can be used when there are multiple join conditions on two tables. This allows for more complex join conditions and provides flexibility in joining tables based on multiple criteria.\n\nF. Option F is true.

In a query containing multiple set operators, INTERSECT always takes precedence over UNION and UNION ALL.\n\nWhen multiple set operators are used in a query, INTERSECT has higher precedence than UNION and UNION ALL. This means that the INTERSECT operation will be evaluated before the other set operators, unless parentheses are used to explicitly define the order of operations.\nD. CHAR columns of different lengths used with a set operator return a VARCHAR2 whose length equals the longest char value.\n\nWhen CHAR columns of different lengths are combined using set operators, the result is a VARCHAR2 column with a length equal to the longest CHAR value in the result set. This is due to how Oracle handles the return type when different CHAR lengths are combined."

This means that only rows where the weight of the first brick is less than the weight of the second brick will be included in the result. There are 6 such combinations: (5,10), (5,15), (5,20), (10,15), (10,20), and (15,20). So the final result will have 6 rows."

When using the interval literal syntax, the specified value represents the number of intervals of the given unit.\n\nIn this case, the query is requesting an interval of 100 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, the interval '100' months is equivalent to 8 years and 4 months.\n\nThe output format for intervals in Oracle is '+YY-MM', where YY represents the number of years and MM represents the number of months.\n\nTherefore, the output will be '+08-04', indicating an interval of 8 years and 4 months.\n\nThe correct answer is D. +08-04."

Similarly, in query C, D and E, the MAX function is nested within the AVG function which is also not allowed. \nWhat do you think?"

This is achieved by specifying multiple INTO clauses in the INSERT statement, each corresponding to a different table.

Multitable INSERT statements can be performed on external tables using SQL*Loader. External tables allow you to access data in external files as if it were in a regular database table. Here's an example:\nINSERT ALL INTO table1 (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2) INTO table2 (column3, column4) VALUES (value3, value4) SELECT * FROM external_table;\nIn this example, the data from the external_table is inserted into both table1 and table2.\nF.

If MOD(quantity, 10) equals 0, it means that quantity is evenly divisible by 10, i.e., quantity is a multiple of 10.\nC. SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE FLOOR(quantity / 10) = TRUNC(quantity / 10);\n\nThis is correct. FLOOR(quantity / 10) and TRUNC(quantity / 10) will both give the same result when quantity is a multiple of 10, because the division of a multiple of 10 by 10 will always be an integer. This ensures that quantity is a multiple of 10."

For example, if a customer can have many orders, then an order can have only one customer.\n\nStatement C, \u201cA many-to-many relationship can be implemented only by using foreign keys,\u201d is not correct because a many-to-many relationship cannot be implemented directly using foreign keys. Instead, it is typically implemented using a junction table (also known as a bridge table or associative table) that sits between the two tables representing the entities in the relationship."

To execute a procedure in another schema, a user would need the EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE system privilege.

A user can grant any object privilege on any schema object he or she owns to any other user or role.

System privileges always set privileges for an entire database.\nPartially True: System privileges are designed to grant a user abilities that are applicable across the database, such as creating tables or executing any procedure. However, the scope of \"entire database\" can vary depending on the specific system privilege. Some system privileges are more granular and allow actions on specific types of objects across the database.\n\nD. A user has all object privileges for every object in their schema by default.\nTrue: In Oracle, users inherently have all privileges on objects they own, which includes the ability to select, insert, update, delete, and execute (for procedures and functions), among other actions on those objects.\n\nF. A role can contain a combination of several privileges and roles.\nTrue: This is one of the primary purposes of roles in Oracle Database. They can group together various system and object privileges as well as other roles for easier and more efficient privilege management.\n\nFrom GPT4"
