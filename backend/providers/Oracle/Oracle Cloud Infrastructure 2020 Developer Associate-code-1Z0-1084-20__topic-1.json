Choreography employs a decentralized approach for service composition. the decision logic is distributed, with no centralized point.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoreography, in contrast, does not rely on a central coordinator. and all participants in the choreography need to be aware of the business process, operations to execute, messages to exchange, and the timing of message exchanges."
