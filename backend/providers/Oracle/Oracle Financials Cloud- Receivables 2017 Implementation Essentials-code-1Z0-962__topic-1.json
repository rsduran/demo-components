Business level changes impact the display of delinquent customers on the Collections Dashboard. To change the Business Level under the Profile tab, you must have Customer selected in the Customer hierarchy. Dunning is impacted by indicating if letters are sent and how they are sent, using the preferred method feature. Changing the collector impacts the individual working the delinquent customer. Under the Contact tab, adding or modifying the customer contact name or address impacts who and where the correspondence is sent."

This is based on the information defined in the country defaults and the application tax options. Oracle Fusion Tax calculates the corresponding taxes accordingly. If you need to revise the taxes, make the Receivables transaction incomplete and revise the tax determinants to recalculate taxes based on your revised values.\n\nWhile copying the Receivable transaction information to the Payables interface tables, the transaction business category of SALES_TRANSACTION available on the Receivables transaction is replaced with PURCHASE_TRANSACTION. If there are any specific tax rules driven based on the transaction business category, you must configure them for both Receivables and Payables transactions."
