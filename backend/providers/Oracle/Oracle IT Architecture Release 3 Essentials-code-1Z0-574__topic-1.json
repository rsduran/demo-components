    "answerDescription": "A metadata repository is used as a common repository for managing metadata of different applications. Many applications use the MDS repository to manage their metadata. Each deployed application uses a logical partition in metadata repository. This logical partition also helps in maintaining the metadata lifecycle. Before deploying an application, you create a partition for it in MDS repository. This command creates a partition with the given name in the specified repository.<br>Note: The Metadata repository provides a centralized holding area for a great deal of SOA related information that will be utilized at design time to construct additional services and applications. The repository also provides the primary means for service discovery. In many ways, the service repository can be utilized as the center point for service oriented design.",

This provides a more secure environment by eliminating redundancies and associated risks. It also enables more effective management of security in the IT environment.<br>Implications:<br>* Security logic must be externalized as much as possible, i.e., developers must not hand-code security logic into business solutions. (A)<br>* Security enforcement, decisions, and management must be performed by dedicated, shared services and infrastructure. (B)<br>* Security services must leverage open standards for interface protocols and message formats where possible in order to promote interoperability.
