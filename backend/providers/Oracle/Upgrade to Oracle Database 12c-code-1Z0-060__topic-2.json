Oracle-managed files eliminate the need for you, the DBA, to directly manage the operating system files that make up an Oracle Database. With Oracle-managed files, you specify file system directories in which the database automatically creates, names, and manages files at the database object level. For example, you need only specify that you want to create a tablespace; you do not need to specify the name and path of the tablespace's datafile with the DATAFILE clause.<br>References:<br>http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/9i/oracle-managed-files.php http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10500_01/server.920/a96521/omf.htm",

The advantage is that you can validate the values in the screens for which you have provided the information in the response file and continue with the installation. To use response file mode, run setup.exe without the -silent parameter, but include the response file or any other parameters that apply.\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NTCLI/advance.htm#NTCLI1339"
