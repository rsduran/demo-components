The reload command rereads the listener.ora\nfile for the new definitions. As you can see, it is not necessary to stop and start the listener to\nreload it. Although stopping and restarting the listener can also accomplish a reload, using\nthe reload command is better because the listener is not actually stopped, which makes this process more efficient. The following code shows an example of the reload command:\nLSNRCTL&gt; reload listener1\nConnecting to (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=btlnx63)(PORT=1522)))\nThe command completed successfully\nLSNRCTL&gt;"

    "answerDescription": "* Oracle Database provides a mechanism to make table structure modifications without significantly affecting the availability of the table. The mechanism is called online table redefinition. Redefining tables online provides a substantial increase in availability compared to traditional methods of redefining tables.<br>* To redefine a table online:<br>Choose the redefinition method: by key or by rowid<br>* By keySelect a primary key or pseudo-primary key to use for the redefinition. Pseudo-primary keys are unique keys with all component columns having NOT<br>NULL constraints. For this method, the versions of the tables before and after redefinition should have the same primary key columns. This is the preferred and default method of redefinition.<br>* By rowidUse this method if no key is available. In this method, a hidden column named M_ROW$$ is added to the post-redefined version of the table. It is recommended that this column be dropped or marked as unused after the redefinition is complete. If COMPATIBLE is set to 10.2.0 or higher, the final phase of redefinition automatically sets this column unused. You can then use the ALTER TABLE ... DROP UNUSED COLUMNS statement to drop it.<br>You cannot use this method on index-organized tables.<br>Note:<br>* When you rebuild an index, you use an existing index as the data source. Creating an index in this manner enables you to change storage characteristics or move to a new tablespace. Rebuilding an index based on an existing data source removes intra-block fragmentation. Compared to dropping the index and using the CREATE INDEX statement, re-creating an existing index offers better performance.<br>Incorrect:<br>Not E: Edition-based redefinition enables you to upgrade the database component of an application while it is in use, thereby minimizing or eliminating down time.",

Multiple buffer pools enable you to address these differences. You can use a KEEP buffer pool to maintain objects in the buffer cache and a RECYCLE buffer pool to prevent objects from consuming unnecessary space in the cache. When an object is allocated to a cache, all blocks from that object are placed in that cache.

It also tells you it is a CDB and that the multi-threaded architecture is disabled. That means OS authentication will work. So D is correct. As long as TCP/IP is configured, then using EZ Connect would work, so C is correct. Assuming there\u2019s a listener and a tnsnames.ora file correctly configured would make E correct. Since the connection is to the ROOT container, that immediately eliminates any answer referencing LOCAL users because ROOT cannot have any LOCAL users. SELECT DISTINCT(COMMON) from DBA_USERS returns YES in CDB$ROOT. Further evidence of COMMON only users in root is provided if you attempt to create a local user in CDB$ROOT (i.e. a user without the C## prefix). Oracle returns an error if you attempt it. So, that eliminates B and F, leaving B as the fourth choice. \n\nAnswer: ACDE\n\nLink for reference: https://www.thegeekdiary.com/oracle-12c-new-feature-multi-threaded-architecture-of-processes/"

    "answerDescription": "B: Job priorities are used only to prioritize among jobs in the same class.<br>Note: Group jobs for prioritization<br>Within the same job class, you can assign priority values of 1-5 to individual jobs so that if two jobs in the class are scheduled to start at the same time, the one with the higher priority takes precedence. This ensures that you do not have a less important job preventing the timely completion of a more important one.<br>C: Set resource allocation for member jobs<br>Job classes provide the link between the Database Resource Manager and the Scheduler, because each job class can specify a resource consumer group as an attribute. Member jobs then belong to the specified consumer group and are assigned resources according to settings in the current resource plan.",

For example, if database files are stored in Oracle ASM disk groups, then before starting the database instance, Oracle Restart ensures that the Oracle ASM instance is started and the required disk groups are mounted. Likewise, if a component must be shut down, Oracle Restart ensures that dependent components are cleanly shut down first.<br>Oracle Restart also manages the weak dependency between database instances and the Oracle Net listener (the listener): When a database instance is started,<br>Oracle Restart attempts to start the listener. If the listener startup fails, then the database is still started. If the listener later fails, Oracle Restart does not shut down and restart any database instances. http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/server.121/e17636/restart.htm#ADMIN12710",

The overall backup time for large data files can be dramatically reduced.\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/VLDBG/GUID-FA70B6EF-0C8B-435B-98C9-CDEBCDCED145.htm#VLDBG1576"

    "answerDescription": "A: Starting with 12c, Oracle has unified all of the auditing types into one single unit called Unified auditing. You dont have to turn on or off all of the different auidting types individually and as a matter of fact auditing is enabled by default right out of the box. The AUD$ and FGA$ tables have been replaced with one single audit trail table. All of the audit data is now stored in Secure Files table thus improving the overall management aspects of audit data itself.<br>B: Further the audit data can also be buffered solving most of the common performance related problems seen on busy environments.<br>E: Unified Auditing is able to collect audit data for Fine Grained Audit, RMAN, Data Pump, Label Security, Database Vault and Real Application Security operations.<br>Note:<br>* Benefits of the Unified Audit Trail<br>The benefits of a unified audit trail are many:<br>/ (B) Overall auditing performance is greatly improved. The default mode that unified audit works is Queued Write mode. In this mode, the audit records are batched in SGA queue and is persisted in a periodic way. Because the audit records are written to SGA queue, there is a significant performance improvement.<br>/ The unified auditing functionality is always enabled and does not depend on the initialization parameters that were used in previous releases<br>/ (A) The audit records, including records from the SYS audit trail, for all the audited components of your Oracle Database installation are placed in one location and in one format, rather than your having to look in different places to find audit trails in varying formats. This consolidated view enables auditors to co-relate audit information from different components. For example, if an error occurred during an INSERT statement, standard auditing can indicate the error number and the SQL that was executed. Oracle Database Vault-specific information can indicate whether this error happened because of a command rule violation or realm violation. Note that there will be two audit records with a distinct AUDIT_TYPE. With this unification in place, SYS audit records appear with AUDIT_TYPE set to<br>Standard Audit.<br>/ The management and security of the audit trail is also improved by having it in single audit trail.<br>/ You can create named audit policies that enable you to audit the supported components listed at the beginning of this section, as well as SYS administrative users. Furthermore, you can build conditions and exclusions into your policies.<br>* Oracle Database 12c Unified Auditing enables selective and effective auditing inside the Oracle database using policies and conditions. The new policy based syntax simplifies management of auditing within the database and provides the ability to accelerate auditing based on conditions.<br>* The new architecture unifies the existing audit trails into a single audit trail, enabling simplified management and increasing the security of audit data generated by the database.",

If at least one control file remains intact, then you can either copy an intact copy of the control file over the damaged or missing control file, or update the initialization parameter file so that it does not refer to the damaged or missing control file. After the CONTROL_FILES parameter references only present, intact copies of the control file, you can restart your database.\n\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/BRADV/rcmcomre.htm#BRADV89763"

If a control file is damaged due to a disk failure, the associated instance must be shut down. Once the disk drive is repaired, the damaged control file can be restored using the intact copy of the control file from the other disk and the instance can be restarted. In this case, no media recovery is required.\n\nThe behavior of multiplexed control files is this:\n -The database writes to all filenames listed for the initialization parameter CONTROL_FILES in the database initialization parameter file.\n\n-The database reads only the first file listed in the CONTROL_FILES parameter during database operation.\n\n-If any of the control files become unavailable during database operation, the instance becomes inoperable and should be aborted.\n\nReference: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14231/control.htm"

The only permanent files (assuming these are configured to be stored in the flash recovery area) are multiplexed copies of the current control file and online redo logs. These cannot be deleted without causing the instance to fail. All other files are transient, because Oracle will generally eventually delete these files, at some point after they become obsolete under the retention policy or have been backed up to tape. Transient files include archived redo logs, datafile copies, control file copies, control file autobackups, and backup pieces."
