Note down this disk number for later use.<br>3. Connect as the opc user to the compute node.<br>4. Start a root-user command shell<br>$ sudo -s #<br>5. Confirm the addition of the storage volume by using the ls command:<br># ls /dev/xvd*<br>6. Create a single, primary partition that occupies the entire storage volume by using the fdisk command.<br>7. Create a file system on the partition by using the mkfs command.<br>8. Create a directory to use as the mount point for the partition by using the mkdir command.<br>9. Mount the partition on the directory you just created by using the mount command.<br>10.

Optionally, on the on-premises database host invoke SQL*Plus and set the on-premises database back to READ WRITE mode.<br>You can use this method only if the on-premises platform is little endian, the on-premises database release is 12.1.0.2 or higher, and the on-premises database and Database Cloud Service database have compatible database character sets and national character sets.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/database-dbaas-cloud/csdbi/mig-remote-cloning-non-cdb.html",
