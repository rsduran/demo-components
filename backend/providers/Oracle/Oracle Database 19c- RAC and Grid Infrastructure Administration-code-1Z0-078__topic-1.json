Transactions may experience temporary interruptions or delays, but they typically do not fail outright unless the failure severely impacts data access.\n\nB is false because In Oracle ASM, the redundancy level of a disk group is not lowered during a failure. Instead, Oracle ASM dynamically adjusts data allocation and mirroring to maintain redundancy even in the presence of failures.\n\nC is false because . Oracle ASM continues to mirror new allocation units across the remaining operational failure group (FG2) to maintain redundancy and data availability.

Correct: ACFS replication can include auditing information as part of the metadata it replicates, ensuring that the audit trail is maintained on the standby system. But it's important to clarify what this entails and how it fits into the overall ACFS replication process.\nE. Correct: ACFS replication allows for a flexible deployment where a single site can host both primary and standby file systems, useful for testing or staging environments.\n\nC. Incorrect: This pertains to Oracle Data Guard, not ACFS replication. While ACFS can replicate redo log files stored in the file system, it does not specifically require standby redo log files for its replication process.\nD.
