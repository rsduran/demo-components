The following list calls out the most compelling examples.<br>* High consolidation density.

This is the same benefit that schema-based consolidation brings.<br>* Rapid provisioning and cloning using SQL.<br>* New paradigms for rapid patching and upgrades. (D, not B)<br>The investment of time and effort to patch one multitenant container database results in patching all of its many pluggable databases. To patch a single pluggable database, you simply unplug/plug to a multitenant container database at a different Oracle Database software version.<br>* (C, not A) Manage many databases as one.<br>By consolidating existing databases as pluggable databases, administrators can manage many databases as one. For example, tasks like backup and disaster recovery are performed at the multitenant container database level.<br>* Dynamic between pluggable database resource management. In Oracle Database 12c, Resource Manager is extended with specific functionality to control the competition for resources between the pluggable databases within a multitenant container database.<br>Note:<br>* Oracle Multitenant is a new option for Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition that helps customers reduce IT costs by simplifying consolidation, provisioning, upgrades, and more. It is supported by a new architecture that allows a multitenant container database to hold many pluggable databases. And it fully complements other options, including Oracle Real Application Clusters and Oracle Active Data Guard. An existing database can be simply adopted, with no change, as a pluggable database; and no changes are needed in the other tiers of the application.",

        "content": "Correct Answer: D\n\nExplanation: * The SGA_TARGET parameter can be dynamically increased up to the value specified for the SGA_MAX_SIZE parameter, and it can also be reduced. \n\nFor example, suppose you have an environment with the following configuration: \nSGA_MAX_SIZE = 1024M \nSGA_TARGET = 512M \nDB_8K_CACHE_SIZE = 128M \n\nIn this example, the value of SGA_TARGET can be resized up to 1024M and can also be reduced until one or more of the automatically sized components reaches its minimum size. The exact value depends on environmental factors such as the number of CPUs on the system. However, the value of DB_8K_CACHE_SIZE remains fixed at all times at 128M \n \n\n*\tDB_8K_CACHE_SIZE     Size of cache for 8K buffers \n*\tFor example, consider this configuration: \n \nSGA_TARGET = 512M \nDB_8K_CACHE_SIZE = 128M \nIn this example, increasing DB_8K_CACHE_SIZE by 16 M to 144M means that the 16M is taken away from the automatically sized components. Likewise, reducing\nDB_8K_CACHE_SIZE by 16M to 112M means that the 16M is given to the automatically sized components."

This ensures that you do not have a less important job preventing the timely completion of a more important one.\nC: Set resource allocation for member jobs\nJob classes provide the link between the Database Resource Manager and the Scheduler, because each job class can specify a resource consumer group as an attribute. Member jobs then belong to the specified consumer group and are assigned resources according to settings in the current resource plan.\n\nhttp://www.dba-oracle.com/job_scheduling/job_classes.htm\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADMIN/scheduse.htm#CIAEGDJB"
