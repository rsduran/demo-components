Here are some best practices for managing costs:\n\n    Create a budget that matches your commitment amount and an alert at 100 percent of the forecast. This gives you an early warning if your spending increases and you're at risk of getting an overage.\n    Use compartments primarily as an access-control mechanism, but consider that you can also see cost per compartment. In practice, many enterprise customers set up one compartment per department, and having one compartment per department works well for cross-charging.\n    Use cost-tracking tags (like cost-center) to allocate cost in more granular ways. We have recently rolled out tag defaults to make it easier to tag resources.\n    Enable monitoring on all resources. You can merge monitoring data with cost data to gain powerful insights on how to improve resource utilization. \n    Use the usage report to analyze costs and drive custom solutions.\n\nThis clearly shows A,B &amp; C are the correct options"

If it did have a list it and would need source, dest, and type of traffic. Not enough info for option A and doesn\u2019t apply to ADW. \n\nFor Option D: Resources that need to connect to the Internet must be in a PUBLIC subnet and have a PUBLIC IP address. A private subnet would need to go through a NAT.  Therefore, Option D is not valid.\n\nFor Option E: is ruled out due to the given CIDR block being private when a public one is needed.  That\u2019s why it goes through the NAT.\n\nADW Access Control List (ACL): IP address in the ACL  is the PUBLIC facing address on the public internet that you want to grant access.

This is the same state it would be in the case of a loss of power or hard crash. In most cases, you can restore a boot volume backup and use it to create an instance. Alternatively you can attach it to an instance as a data volume to repair it or recover data, see Attaching a Volume. To ensure a bootable image, you should create a custom image from your instance.

It says 'Marking a security rule as stateless indicates that you do NOT want to use connection tracking for any traffic that matches that rule. This means that response traffic is not automatically allowed. To allow the response traffic for a stateless ingress rule, you must create a corresponding stateless egress rule'.

When determining a backup schedule, your backup plan and goals should consider the following:\nFrequency: How often you want to back up your data.\nRecovery time: How long you can wait for a backup to be restored and accessible to the applications that use it. The time for a backup to complete varies on several factors, but it will generally take a few minutes or longer, depending on the size of the data being backed up and the amount of data that has changed since your last backup.\nNumber of stored backups: How many backups you need to keep available and the deletion schedule for those you no longer need. You can only create one backup at a time, so if a backup is underway, it will need to complete before you can create another one. For details about the number of backups you can store"

This is an incorrect and dangerous assumption because snapshots, unless copied to secondary media (e.g. another storage array or tape), do not protect against media failures. While there are benefits of using snapshots for development or testing purposes on non-production systems, they should not be considered as valid data protection or backups of Oracle databases. Instead, customers should look to Recovery Manager (RMAN) and Fast Recovery Area (FRA) as the Oracle-supported solution to create and manage Oracle database backups. Note that since RMAN and Fast Recovery Area are built-in features of the Oracle database, this solution also applies to Oracle Exadata Database Machine, with the additional benefit of extremely high performance."

Decide what part number you want to use for each part. Part numbers can range from 1 to 10,000. You do not need to assign contiguous numbers, but Object Storage constructs the object by ordering part numbers in ascending order.\n\nInitiating an Upload\nAfter you finish creating object parts, initiate a multipart upload by making a CreateMultipartUpload REST API call. Provide the object name and any object metadata. Object Storage responds with a unique upload ID that you must include in any requests related to this multipart upload. Object Storage also marks the upload as active. The upload remains active until you explicitly commit it or abort it.\n\nhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingmultipartuploads.htm"
