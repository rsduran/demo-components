A SYNC/AFFIRM transport provides an additional protection benefit at the expense of a performance impact caused by the time required to complete the I/O to the standby redo log.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: When a transport is performed using SYNC/NOAFFIRM, the primary performs write operations and waits only for acknowledgement that the data has been received on the standby, not that it has been written to disk.

    "answerDescription": "RMAN uses a recovery catalog to track filenames for all database files in a Data Guard environment. A recovery catalog is a database schema used by RMAN to store metadata about one or more Oracle databases. The catalog also records where the online redo logs, standby redo logs, tempfiles, archived redo logs, backup sets, and image copies are created.<br>RMAN commands use the recovery catalog metadata to behave transparently across different physical databases in the Data Guard environment. For example, you can back up a tablespace on a physical standby database and restore and recover it on the primary database. Similarly, you can back up a tablespace on a primary database and restore and recover it on a physical standby database.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: Because a logical standby database is not a block-for-block copy of the primary database, you cannot use a logical standby database to back up the primary database<br>D: Backups of standby control files and nonstandby control files are interchangeable. For example, you can restore a standby control file on a primary database and a primary control file on a physical standby database. This interchangeability means that you can offload control file backups to one database in a Data Guard environment. RMAN automatically updates the filenames for database files during restore and recovery at the databases.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e41134/rman.htm#SBYDB4853",

Therefore, on a far sync instance there is no need to copy data files or restore data files from a backup. Once the far sync instance has been created, the configuration is modified to send redo synchronously from the primary database to the far sync instance in Maximum Availability mode and the far sync instance then forwards the redo asynchronously in real time.<br>D: Creating and Configuring a Far Sync Instance<br>Take the following steps to create a far sync instance:<br>1. Create the control file for the far sync instance.<br>2. Create a parameter file (PFILE) from the server parameter file (SPFILE) used by the primary database.<br>3. Create a server parameter file (spfile) from the edited parameter file (pfile) to facilitate any subsequent changes to parameter values.<br>4. Use an operating system copy utility to copy the far sync instance control file created in Step 1 and the server parameter file (spfile) created in Step 3 from the primary system to the appropriate locations on the far sync instance system.<br>5. Create standby redo logs in the same way they are created for a regular standby.<br>Etc.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>C: A far sync instance manages a control file, receives redo into standby redo logs (SRLs), and archives those SRLs to local archived redo logs.<br>E: A far sync instance is supported in either maximum performance or maximum availability mode only.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SBYDB/create_fs.htm",

Consequently, a logical standby database can simultaneously be used to meet many other business requirements, for example it can run reporting workloads that would problematical for the primary's throughput.<br>F: Logical standby can be used to greatly reduce downtime associated with applying patchsets and new software releases. A logical standby can be upgraded to the new release and then switched over to become the active primary. This allows full availability while the old primary is converted to a logical standby and the patchset is applied.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e41134/standby.htm#SBYDB00103",

You can restore an entire database, data files, control files, spfile, or tablespaces.<br>Note: An Oracle database consists of one or more logical storage units called tablespaces, which collectively store all of the database's data. Each tablespace in an Oracle database consists of one or more files called datafiles, which are physical structures that conform to the operating system in which Oracle is running.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SBYDB/rman.htm#SBYDB00755",

    "answerDescription": "Execution: Execution of the rolling upgrade has five stages.<br>Stage 1 (5): The DBMS_ROLLING.START_PLAN procedure starts the execution of the rolling upgrade. This converts the LGM database, the future primary database, to a logical standby and starts the SQL Apply process at the LGM.<br>Stage 2 (2): You upgrade the database software at the databases that are part of the leading group. You also run the upgrade scripts at the LGM. After this is done, you must restart SQL Apply processes at the LGM database.<br>Stage 3 (4): After the apply lag reaches a given threshold (set to 10 minutes by default, but can be configured during the specification stage), the<br>DBMS_ROLLING.SWITCHOVER procedure proceeds with the switchover operation. When the switchover is complete, the LGM becomes the primary database.<br>Stage 4 : The LGM is now the primary database running the new database software and the databases in the leading group are protecting it. The TGM is mounted and the databases in the trailing group are still running the older version of the database software. You must prepare the TGM and TGS databases for upgrade by upgrading the database software and re-mounting the databases on the higher version binaries.<br>Stage 5 (3, 6): Execute the DBMS_ROLLING.FINISH_PLAN procedure at the current primary database (originally the LGM). It reinstates all the databases in the trailing group to become the standbys of the current primary database, and restarts the apply processes. The FINISH_PLAN procedure waits for all databases in the trailing group to be upgraded to the new release (although the database software for the trailing group databases was changed in Stage 4, the data dictionary of the trailing group databases, except for any logical standbys in the trailing group, are updated based on media recovery of the redo generated during the upgrade at the LGM database).<br>Note: To upgrade the database software in an Oracle Data Guard configuration in a rolling fashion, you first designate a physical standby as the future primary database.<br>Conceptually, the rolling upgrade process splits the Oracle Data Guard configuration into two groups: the leading group (LG) and the trailing group (TG).<br>Databases in the leading group are upgraded first; hence the name leading group. The leading group contains the designated future primary database, and the physical standbys that you can configure to protect the designated future primary. The future primary is first converted into a logical standby database and then the new database software is installed on it and the upgrade process is run. Other standby databases in the leading group also must have their software upgraded at this point.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SBYDB/dbms_rolling_upgrades.htm",

    "answer": "C",
    "answerDescription": "The Maximum Availability protection mode provides the highest level of data protection that is possible without compromising the availability of a primary database. Transactions do not commit until all redo data needed to recover those transactions has been written to the online redo log and to at least one synchronized standby database. If the primary database cannot write its redo stream to at least one synchronized standby database, it operates as if it were in maximum performance mode to preserve primary database availability until it is again able to write its redo stream to a synchronized standby database.<br>This mode ensures that no data loss will occur if the primary database fails, but only if a second fault does not prevent a complete set of redo data from being sent from the primary database to at least one standby database.<br>When a transport is performed using SYNC/AFFIRM, the primary performs write operations and waits for acknowledgment that the redo has been transmitted synchronously to the physical standby and written to disk. A SYNC/AFFIRM transport provides an additional protection benefit at the expense of a performance impact caused by the time required to complete the I/O to the standby redo log.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>D: In the case of SYNC/NOAFFIRM, in which there is no check that data has been written to disk on the standby, there may be some data loss.<br>A, B: The Maximum Protection mode ensures that zero data loss occurs if a primary database fails. To provide this level of protection, the redo data needed to recover a transaction must be written to both the online redo log and to at least one synchronized standby database before the transaction commits. To ensure that data loss cannot occur, the primary database will shut down, rather than continue processing transactions, if it cannot write its redo stream to at least one synchronized standby database.<br>Because this data protection mode prioritizes data protection over primary database availability, Oracle recommends that a minimum of two standby databases be used to protect a primary database that runs in maximum protection mode to prevent a single standby database failure from causing the primary database to shut down.<br>E: The Maximum Performance protection mode provides the highest level of data protection that is possible without affecting the performance of a primary database. This is accomplished by allowing transactions to commit as soon as all redo data generated by those transactions has been written to the online log.<br>Redo data is also written to one or more standby databases, but this is done asynchronously with respect to transaction commitment, so primary database performance is unaffected by delays in writing redo data to the standby database(s).<br>This protection mode offers slightly less data protection than maximum availability mode and has minimal impact on primary database performance.<br>This is the default protection mode.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28294/protection.htm",

When switched back into standby mode, all changes made whilst in read-write mode are lost. This is achieved using flashback database, but the standby database does not need to have flashback database explicitly enabled to take advantage of this feature, thought it works just the same if it is.<br>References:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DGBKR/sofo.htm#DGBKR391<br>https://oracle-base.com/articles/12c/data-guard-setup-using-broker-12cr1#flashback_database",
