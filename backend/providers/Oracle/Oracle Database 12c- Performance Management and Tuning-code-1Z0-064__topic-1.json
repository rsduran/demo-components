        "content": "Correct Ans: C\nBaseline Templates\nBaseline templates enable you to create baselines for a contiguous time period in the future. There are two types of baseline templates:\nSingle Baseline Templates\nUse a single baseline template to create a baseline for a single contiguous time period in the future. This is useful if you know beforehand of a time period that you intend to capture in the future. For example, you may want to capture AWR data during a system test that is scheduled for the upcoming weekend. In this case, you can create a single baseline template to automatically capture the time period when the test occurs.\nRepeating Baseline Templates\nUse a repeating baseline template to create and drop baselines based on a repeating time schedule. This is useful if you want Oracle Database to automatically capture a contiguous time period on an ongoing basis. For example, you may want to capture AWR data during every Monday morning for a month. In this case, you can create a repeating baseline template to automatically create baselines on a repeating schedule for every Monday, and automatically remove older baselines after a specified expiration interval, such as one month."

If you explicitly stated not to publish the new stats, they would be stored in Pending Stats. By setting the the OPTIMIZER_USE_PENDING_STATISTICS initialization parameter to TRUE for the session, you would use PENDING STATS and not the current Stats."

The default value is 10%.\nWhich\n\nchanges the stale_percent to 5\nfor this table and when stats job runs it will not look for 10% rather it looks for 5% staleness and collect the stats for this table.\n\nYou can also set the stale_percent at database level and schema level using dbms_stats.set_database_prefs &amp; dbms_stats.set_schema_prefs subprograms.\n\n\n\nD. Use the DBMS_STATS.PUBLISH_PENDING_STATS procedure to make pending statistics the\ncurrent statistics.\nIf you are satisfied with the test results, use the PUBLISH_PENDING_STATS procedure to render the pending statistics for SH.CUSTOMERS current."

SQL Tuning Advisor makes other types of recommendations, such as creating SQL profiles and restructuring SQL statements. * The query optimizer can also help you tune SQL statements. By using SQL Tuning Advisor and SQL Access Advisor, you can invoke the query optimizer in advisory mode to examine a SQL statement or set of statements and determine how to improve their e\u00b2ciency. SQL Tuning Advisor and SQL Access Advisor can make various recommendations, such as creating SQL profiles, restructuring SQL statements, creating additional indexes or materialized views, and refreshing optimizer statistics.

This cache contains the shared SQL and PL/SQL areas and control structures such as locks and library cache handles."
