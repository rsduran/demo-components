While this is expected functionality, there are use case when we want to allow commit, even data was changed already by someone else. For example, in more complex systems, data is updated by PL/SQL procedures, we don't want to inform user with error about this. There is a way to override lock method in EO implementation class, catch lock error and raise lock again. This works, but there is different way - to use<br>Change Indicator. This property defines specific attribute to be responsible for row data changes tracking, instead of checking every attribute. Only if Change<br>Indicator attribute value will be changed in DB, then current row changes will be prevented and user will be informed about someone else changes in the same row.<br>References:<br>https://blogs.oracle.com/emeapartnerweblogic/entry/explaining_change_indicator_property_for",
