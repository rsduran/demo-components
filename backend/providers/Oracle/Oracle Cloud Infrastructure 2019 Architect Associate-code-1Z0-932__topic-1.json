You can use volume groups to create volume group backups and clones that are pointin-time and crash-consistent.\nThis simplifies the process to create time-consistent backups of running enterprise applications that span multiple storage volumes across multiple instances. You can then restore an entire group of volumes from a volume group backup.\nTo create a backup of the volume group\nOpen the navigation menu.

However, it is not the most secure option because it relies on IP-based access control, which can be less secure than access control based on identity and access management (IAM) policies.\n\nTherefore, the most secure and appropriate option is to create an instance principal for the DB System and write an IAM policy that allows the instance principal read-only access to the file storage service. This approach provides fine-grained control over access to the file system based on the identity of the DB System, ensuring that only the DB System can access the file system and only for read-only operations."
