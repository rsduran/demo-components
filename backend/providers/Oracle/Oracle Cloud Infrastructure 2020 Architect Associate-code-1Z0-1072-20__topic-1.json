When cookie-based session persistence is enabled, the load balancer ensures that a client's request is always sent to the same backend server that it initially connected to. Disabling cookie-based session persistence can help balance the load across all backend servers, but it can also cause issues if the backend servers require session affinity. In this case, disabling cookie-based session persistence may not be the best solution. Solution is D"

You can use NFS export options to specify access levels for IP addresses or CIDR blocks connecting to file systems through exports in a mount target. Access can be restricted so that each client\u2019s file system is inaccessible and invisible to the other, providing better security controls in multi-tenant environments.\n\nUsing NFS export option access controls, you can limit clients' ability to connect to the file system and view or write data. For example, if you want to allow clients to consume but not update resources in your file system, you can set access to Read Only. You can also reduce client root access to your file systems and map specified User IDs (UIDs) and Group IDs (GIDs) to an anonymous UID/GID of your choice.
