The supply is reserved against a sales order until shipping. This process provides support to create and link supply after a sales order is entered and scheduled, allowing you to reduce your inventory while maintaining the ability to respond to customer demands.\n\nYou create supply for a back-to-back order using one or more of the following back-to-back flows:\nBuy: Procurement from an external supplier.\nMake: Production in an internal manufacturing facility (includes in-house manufacturing and contract manufacturing).\nTransfer: Transfer from another warehouse.\nOn hand: Reservation of on-hand supply in the fulfillment organization.\n\nNote: Back-to-back flow is currently supported only for discrete manufacturing."

You must lock a model to edit it.\nOn the Edit Configurator Model page, select the root node of the model, choose Create from the Actions menu.\nNote: You can only create supplemental structure on the root node of an item-based model.\nSelect the type of supplemental structure feature to create.\nIn the dialog box for the feature type, enter the required attributes for the feature.\nIn the Details region, you can modify the attributes of the feature.\nRepeat these steps to add other features to the model.\nSave your changes to the model. If you don't save, you will be prompted to save when you leave the edit page.\nOptionally, test the effects of your changes by clicking the Test Model button."
