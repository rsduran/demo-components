Instead, each target server must access the archive files from a single source directory for deployment. The staging directory of target servers is ignored for nostage deployments.<br>* External_stage mode is similar to stage mode, in that target servers deploy using local copies of the deployment files. However, the Administration Server does not automatically copy the deployment files to targeted servers in external_stage mode; instead, you must copy the files to the staging directory of each target server before deployment.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>C, D: In the external_stage and Nostage mode  the Administration Server does not copy deployment files.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs81/deployment/concepts.html#1001124",
