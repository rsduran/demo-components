Depending on volume size and amount of data written to volumes, this sync can take hours. After the initial synchronization process is complete, the replication process is continuous, with the typical Recovery Point Object (RPO) target rate being less than thirty minutes for replication across regions, however the RPO can vary."

It combines disk mirroring (RAID 1) with striping (RAID 0). This configuration helps protect your data from NVMe device failures as data is mirrored across multiple drives while also improving write performance by striping data across the mirrored pairs. This option offers a good balance between data protection and performance for mission-critical workloads.\n\nOptions A (RAID 1) and C (mirroring to OCI Object Storage) offer data redundancy but do not provide the same level of write performance improvement that RAID 10 offers."
