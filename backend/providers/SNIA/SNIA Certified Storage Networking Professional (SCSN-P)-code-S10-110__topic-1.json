Other terms that are used to refer to an HBA are host controllers or host adapters with the name typically tied to the devices being connected as well as the I/O functionality provided by the adapter. Some of the most common components the computer hardware devices are used to connect are eSATA, Fiber Channel, and SCSI devices."
