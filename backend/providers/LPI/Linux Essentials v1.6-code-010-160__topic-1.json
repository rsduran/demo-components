It's often one of the first tools a Linux administrator will use when investigating performance issues."

        "content": "Here is a quick explanation for people like me who were initially confused about a file having only one group: In Unix-like operating systems, a file can have only one group owner. However, there is a feature called \"file access control lists\" (ACLs) that allows for more fine-grained control over file permissions and can be used to grant additional permissions to specific users or groups beyond the owner and group associated with the file.\n\nWith ACLs, you can specify permissions for multiple users and groups on a file, providing more flexibility than the traditional owner-group-other model. ACLs enable you to set permissions for specific users or groups without changing the file's primary group ownership.\n\nIt's important to note that while ACLs provide additional flexibility, they are not universally supported on all file systems or systems. Their availability depends on the specific operating system and file system in use. Additionally, managing permissions through ACLs can be more complex than using the standard owner-group-other model."

        "content": "Updated response...Based on more research, The answer \"E\" may be \"Technically\" incorrect. The text for selection \"E\" is \"Lock a user account\" where the \"passwd\" command actually \"Locks\\Expires the password\".  Per \"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/passwd-command-in-linux-with-examples/\" the \"-l\" option lists the following: \"-l, \u2013lock: Lock the password of user. This appends the encrypted password of the user with a character \u2018!\u2019, and thus making it unable to match with any of input password combinations. This does not disable the account but prevents the user from logging in using a password. Though other authentication methods like ssh keys can be used to login to the account.\"  So the account is \"technically \"NOT\" locked but the password is.  The site \"https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-locking-an-account/\" lists \"locking\" the password with the \"-l\" is the same as locking the account.  If the account were truly locked \"NO\" authentication would be possible."
