As the packet traverses through the network, the Hop Limit is reduced by one at each hop. If the Hop Limit field reaches zero, the packet is discarded, preventing it from circulating indefinitely and avoiding potential routing loops. This mechanism helps ensure that packets have a limited lifetime and don't endlessly circulate in the network."

Note that the packet spacing is about 2s in NIOS's NTP for both BURST and IBURST, unlike the traditional 16s (for IBURST) in default NTP, this is to further hasten the synchronization of clocks. \n\nBURST sends a burst of eight packets when the server is reachable, and is used to accurately measure jitter with long poll intervals. \n\nIBURST sends a burst of eight packets when the server is unreachable (tries to find out if a host is reachable), and then shorten the time until the first sync. We specify the NTP IBURST for faster clock synchronization. This option is considered \u201caggressive\u201d by some public NTP servers. If an NTP server is unresponsive, the IBURST mode continues to send frequent queries until the server responds and time synchronization starts"

Personally I would chose the newer, better \"pool\" command though.\n\n\"The pool scheme is configured using one or more pool commands with DNS names indicating the pool from which to draw. The pool command can be used more than once; duplicate servers are detected and discarded. In principle, it is possible to use a configuration file containing a single line pool pool.ntp.org. The NTP Pool Project offers instructions on using the pool with the server command, which is suboptimal but works with older versions of ntpd predating the pool command. With recent ntpd, consider replacing the multiple server commands in their example with a single pool command.\""

The default query type is A, unless the -x option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup. A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required , set the type to ixfr=N.

All resource record types can be expressed as TYPEnn, where nn is the number of the type. If the resource record type is not supported in BIND 9, the result is displayed as described in RFC 3597."
