This statement is not true. udev creates entries for devices dynamically based on the devices that are connected to the system. It does not create entries for all possible devices on boot.\n\nC. You can create block or character devices in /dev/ using mknod, even when udev is in use. However, udev will typically manage device creation and permissions, and manual creation with mknod is usually not necessary.\n\nE. The content of /dev/ is not stored in /etc/udev/dev, and it is not restored during system startup. /dev/ is managed by udev and populated dynamically.\n\nSo, options B and D are the correct answers"
