While it provides information about running processes and system statistics, including uptime, it is primarily a process viewer rather than a command for directly displaying system uptime.\n\nCommands A and D, `uptime` and `uname -u`, are more focused on specifically reporting system uptime and are generally easier to use for that specific purpose."
