Unless a systemd mount unit is created, systemd unmounts the file system after a short period of time.\n\nThis statement is not accurate. systemd doesn't automatically unmount a file system just because a systemd mount unit is not created.

The file system will remain mounted until explicitly unmounted using the umount command or a similar method.\n\nTherefore, option D is not a behavior associated with systemd when a file system is mounted manually.

If you don't announce the mount pint in /etc/fstab, the only way to have a correct mount point is by creating it with the systems mount (https://oguya.ch/posts/2015-09-01-systemd-mount-partition/). Finally we can set a cron that start the mount unit every boot time, which, it can not be possible whit the option C without creating an entry on the /etc/fstab file.\n\nE.

On the other hand, Ctrl + Z will only pause the process temporarily, and send the running process to the background.

GRUB2 typically resides in the first partition.\nE. grub-install current /dev/sda1: As mentioned earlier, \"current\" is not a valid argument for grub-install."

So, starting from this point, grub only can be installed by referring to a device and not to a partition. In fact,  on page 78 of the LPIC-1 book, it says: \"To install GRUB Legacy on a disk from a running system we will use the grub-install utility. The\nbasic command is grub-install DEVICE where DEVICE is the disk where you wish to install GRUB Legacy. An example would be /dev/sda.\" In conclusion, the right answer is A."

The modprobe command always takes dependencies into account when performing operations. When you ask modprobe to load a specific kernel module, it first examines the dependencies of that module, if there are any, and loads them if they are not already loaded into the kernel. modprobe resolves dependencies recursively: it will load all dependencies of dependencies, and so on, if necessary, thus ensuring that all dependencies are always met.\"\n\nhttps://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/system-administrators-guide/kernel-module-driver-configuration/Working_with_Kernel_Modules/"
