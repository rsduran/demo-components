In order to manage stakeholder expectation, there must be open communication<br>(through collaboration and transparency) throughout the project cycle. This maximizes alignment, helps with making business decisions, and reduces risk.<br>Although, the Scrum Guide does not directly state that the Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring transparency it is implicit. The Scrum Master is responsible for the process in which Scrum is adopted and enacted. Scrum is founded on empiricism and the Scrum Master helps those inside and outside the team work in an empirical environment which includes transparency (one of the three pillars of empiricism).",

The Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the<br>Sprint. This emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal.<br>Why C is incorrect:<br>a) The Dev Team does not commit to finishing all items in the Sprint Backlog. Committing to completing all items would be fixed scope and fixed time leaving no room to adapt. They commit to the Sprint Goal and doing the right thing. b) It's also incorrect for the PO to focus on completing the entire Sprint Backlog. Finishing everything should not be his main focus. Having a shippable increment that meets the Sprint Goal is more important than trying to finish everything. The advice in option C is equivalent to \u05d2\u20acDon't worry, they'll get everything done.\u05d2\u20ac but because of the complex domain, you cannot guarantee everything will get done.",

Some teams are able to handle the risk and<br>\u05d2\u20acsynergize\u05d2\u20ac whereas others might struggle. Saying that, the relationship between defining a Sprint Goal and Development Team size is unclear.<br>But the relationship between the ordering of the Product Backlog, the PO having clear objectives, and the Sprint Goal are direct. The Product Owner typically comes to the Sprint Planning with a business objective in mind and Product Backlog items related to the business objective. After deciding what can be done for the upcoming Sprint, the Scrum Team will craft a Sprint Goal that would be met through the implementation of the items. This is not dependent on the size of the team nor length of the Sprint.<br>Scrum is also a framework that's fit for purpose.
