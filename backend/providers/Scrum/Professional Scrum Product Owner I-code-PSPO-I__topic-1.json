To reduce complexity, [the Daily Scrum] is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.  If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers. The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves selfmanagement. \""
