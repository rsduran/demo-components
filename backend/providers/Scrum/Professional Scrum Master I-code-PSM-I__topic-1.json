If the team is waiting for an external supplier to deliver a component and there won't be enough work in the next Sprint to occupy the full team without that component, it makes sense to reorder the backlog so that work not dependent on the external component can be planned for the next Sprint.

The teams can start implementing Scrum and adapt their processes incrementally, discovering what works best for them. Over time, they can assess the need for re-organization and potentially transition to feature teams if it aligns with the project's goals and requirements."

During the Sprint Retrospective.\n\nExplanation: The Sprint Retrospective is the most appropriate time for the Development Team to reflect on their practices and processes. If the Development Team identifies opportunities for improvement or finds that the current Definition of Done is inadequate, they can propose changes to it during the Sprint Retrospective. This allows the team to continuously enhance their Definition of Done, align it with their evolving understanding and requirements, and ensure it effectively reflects the expected quality and completeness of their work. It is a valuable opportunity to refine and update the Definition of Done for future Sprints."

This means that the work completed by the Development Team should be tested and verified, and any dependencies or conflicts with other parts of the product should be resolved.\n\nOption C highlights that there should be no incomplete or unfinished work left from the Definition of Done. The DoD is an agreed-upon set of criteria that the Development Team and the Product Owner define at the beginning of the project. It outlines the quality standards that must be met for the work to be considered \"Done.\"\n\nOption E is not entirely correct because being \"Ready to be released to end-users\" is a subset of the DoD. The work must meet all the criteria outlined in the DoD, including testing, integration, and documentation, to be considered \"Done.\""

It's essential to maintain transparency, open communication, and a realistic approach to meeting the project's goals. Instead of compromising quality or adding extra personnel, it's more appropriate to remind the Product Owner (Marian) that additional Release Sprints may be necessary to complete the remaining work. This approach ensures the project maintains integrity, and the Development Team does not feel pressured to compromise their work or make unrealistic promises."

Deciding on team leads is important, but in Scrum, teams are encouraged to be self-organizing, and this question might prematurely impose a hierarchy that Scrum seeks to minimize.\n\nD. Identifying subject matter experts on each team can be vital for ensuring that teams have the necessary knowledge, but it might not be the primary initial concern.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting initial question that could encompass these considerations and is aligned with Scrum principles might be:\n\nA.

While it's encouraged to have a potentially releasable Increment at the end of each Sprint, the decision to release it to customers or users is made by the Product Owner based on business priorities and market readiness. Some Increments may be released immediately, while others may accumulate and be released in larger increments over time. The key is that each Increment should be in a potentially releasable state, meaning that it could be released with minimal additional work if the decision to release is made."

If the Development Team identifies opportunities for improvement or finds that the current Definition of Done is inadequate, they can propose changes to it during the Sprint Retrospective. This allows the team to continuously enhance their Definition of Done, align it with their evolving understanding and requirements, and ensure it effectively reflects the expected quality and completeness of their work. It is a valuable opportunity to refine and update the Definition of Done for future Sprints."

They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.\n\nThe Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs."
