If we just add Region to filters card it has nothing to do with parameter and we can use this filter without parameter at all. That is why answer C is not the case. So we already have a parameter. Next we need to create a calculated field with formula [Region] = [Choose Region]. After that we put calculated field to filters card and set it to True.
