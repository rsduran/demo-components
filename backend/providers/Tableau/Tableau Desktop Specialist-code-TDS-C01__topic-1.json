Supports large data sets: You can create extracts that contain billions of rows of data.\n2. Help improve performance: When you interact with views that use extract data sources, you generally experience better performance than when interacting with views based on connections to the original data.\n3. Support additional functionality: Extracts allow you to take advantage of Tableau functionality that's not available or supported by the original data, such as the ability to compute Count Distinct.\n4.Provide offline access to your data: If you are using Tableau Desktop, extracts allow you to save and work with the data locally when the original data is not available. For example, when you are traveling"
