In this\ncase the assumption that SSH access is needed is incorrect.\nBusiness requirement:\n \"Improve security by defining and adhering to a set of security and Identity and\nAccess Management (IAM) best practices for cloud.\"\nB - A VPN is a way to connect from remote to the internal IP of an instance.

The networking fabric is different, the disk I/O is different, and the CPUs are different too. We don't know the exact specifications of the data centre CPUs to draw a parallel to the processors offered by GCP. As you can see, the performance can vary a lot depending on the frequency. (remember shelling out additional 500$ for upgrading CPU from 2.6GHz to 2.8GHz when buying your a laptop?). You may realize that you need more vCPUs after migrating to Google Cloud or maybe less, but until you migrate and test it out, there is no way to say which is the best machine type. So the recommendation should be to start small, increase the instance size as needed until the performance is of an acceptable standard, and that is your machine type."
