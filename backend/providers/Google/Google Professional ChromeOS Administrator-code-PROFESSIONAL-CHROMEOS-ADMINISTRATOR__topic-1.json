        "content": "This approach balances access to new features with controlled testing. Here's how it works:\nStable Channel: Most devices receive automatic updates on the Stable channel, ensuring security and stability for the majority of users.\nBeta Channel: IT staff use the Beta channel to access updates earlier, allowing them to identify and address potential issues before they affect the entire organization. Evaluation and Adaptation: IT staff can test compatibility, adjust configurations, and prepare for broader deployment based on their experience with the Beta channel. Option B is incorrect because disabling auto-updates compromises security and delays access to new features."
