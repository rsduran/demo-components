Create Request Latency and Error Rate as service level indicators.\nRequest Latency measures the time it takes for a request to be processed by the game, and is an important indicator of the responsiveness of the game from the user's perspective. A high request latency can indicate that the game is experiencing performance issues or is under heavy load, which may negatively impact the user experience.\n\nError Rate measures the percentage of requests that result in errors, such as HTTP errors or timeouts. A high error rate can indicate that the game is experiencing technical issues or is not able to handle incoming requests effectively, which can also negatively impact the user experience. By monitoring these SLIs, you can identify issues with the game's performance and take appropriate action to improve the user experience."

Configure Workload Identity and service accounts to be used by the application platform.\n\nWorkload Identity is a feature of Google Cloud that allows you to map identities from your on-premises or Google Cloud identity provider to Google Cloud service accounts.
