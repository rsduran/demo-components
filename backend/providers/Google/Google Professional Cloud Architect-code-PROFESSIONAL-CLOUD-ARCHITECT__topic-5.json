This means that the test coverage for the new game's backend should be significantly higher than the test coverage for their existing backends on other platforms.\n\nUnit tests and end-to-end tests are both important for ensuring the quality and reliability of the game's backend, so both types of tests should be included in the testing strategy. Testing the GCP infrastructure directly may not be necessary, as GCP provides managed services that are expected to be reliable and well-maintained.\n\nIt's generally not recommended to perform testing only in the production environment, as this can potentially cause problems for live users and result in lost revenue. Instead, it's important to test the game's backend thoroughly in a staging or testing environment before deploying it to production."

It is a best practice to manage services using immutable containers. -Cloud Load Balancing supports globally distributed services across multiple regions. It provides a single global IP address that can be used in DNS records. Using URL Maps, the requests can be routed to only the services that Mountkirk wants to expose. -Container Registry is a single place for a team to manage Docker images for the services.\n\nD is not correct because you cannot reserve a single frontend IP for cloud functions.
