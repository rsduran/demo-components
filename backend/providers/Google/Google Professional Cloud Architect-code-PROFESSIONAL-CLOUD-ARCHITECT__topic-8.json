        "content": "A is correct\n\nAs described in the Designing a Connected Vehicle Platform on Cloud IoT Core case study,\n\n1. Google Cloud Dataflow is essential to transform, enrich and then store telemetry data by using distributed data pipelines\n\n2. Cloud Pub/Sub is essential to handle the streams of vehicle data while at the same time decoupling the specifics of the backend processing implementation\n\n\n\nIt now comes down to a choice between\n\n1. Cloud SQL vs BigQuery for analytics.\n\n2. GKE (with or without Anthos) + Cloud Load balancing vs App Engine.\n\n\n\nFor the first point, there is no doubt that BigQuery is the preferred choice for analytics. Cloud SQL does not scale to this sort of data volume (9TB/day + data coming through when vehicles are serviced).\n\nFor the second point, GKE with Cloud Load Balancing is a better fit than App Engine. App Engine is a regional service whereas, with the other option, you can have multiple GKE clusters in different regions. And Cloud Load Balancing can send requests to the cluster in the region that is closest to the vehicle. This option minimizes the latency and makes the feedback loop more real-time."

If we move/copy data between continents it will cost us money therefore compressing the data before copying to another region/continent makes sense.\nPreprocessing also makes sense because we probably want to process smaller chunks of data first (remember 100K milage).\nSo now type of target bucket; multi-region or standard? multi-region is good for high-availability and low latency with a little more cost however question doesn't require any of these features.\nTherefore I think standard storage option is good to go given lower costs are always better.\n\nSo my answer would be D"

It is free inside of region - so make sense to move all data into one region for processing/performance (from all continents). Cross-region cost is 0.01$ per GB, and inter-continent 0.12$ per GB. \nIf to consider just option B (moving all raw data into one region) then just monthly volume would cost:\n900 TB (all 20M units daily) 30 days 0.12 $ = 3.24 M $ (just for data transfer). So, it definitely makes sense to preprocess/compress data per region, and then move all that data into one region for final analysis. That would save up to 10-100 times on egress costs. Also, important aspect is processing time - running it in parallel on all regions accelerates overall analysis effort. Faster result - faster in-field improvements.\nLook this interesting video about price optimization in GCP (first 11.5 mins are about Storage/Network)\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#considerations"

For this to be true, the vehicles would need a powerful computer, at least if this model is anywhere close to the AI models around...\nSo, in this case, the ML model would have to be uploaded to all 20 million vehicles for them to change this parameters offline?\nThat seems kind of crazy, but maybe I'm lacking some kind of info?\nMaybe the ML models are very portable and don't require much processing power?"

Understanding it this way it certainly can only be B as from the scenario description we have most of the machines not connected to a cellular network and therefore it is impossible to pass data to them."
