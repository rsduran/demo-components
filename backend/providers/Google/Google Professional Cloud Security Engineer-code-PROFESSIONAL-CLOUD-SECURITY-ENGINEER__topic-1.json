To do so google provides a tool called Cloud Directory Sync. This tool will read all identities in AD and replicate those within GCP.\n\n Once the identities have been replicated then it's possible to apply IAM permissions on the groups. After that you will configure SAML so google can act as a service provider and either you ADFS&nbsp;or other third party tools like Ping or Okta will act as the identity provider. This way you effectively delegate the authentication from Google to something that is under your control.\""

We recommend using this strategy because it is more convenient and secure than manually passing credentials.\n\nAdditionally, we recommend you use Google Cloud Client Libraries for your application.

The process of encrypting a key with another key is known as envelope encryption.\nHere are best practices for managing KEKs:\n-Store KEKs centrally. (KMS )\n-Set the granularity of the DEKs they encrypt based on their use case. For example, consider a workload that requires multiple DEKs to encrypt the workload's data chunks. You could use a single KEK to wrap all DEKs that are responsible for that workload's encryption.\n-Rotate keys regularly, and also after a suspected incident."

This will allow Engineering Group A to create and manage resources in the specified subnet while restricting them from making changes to other resources in the host project. Granting Compute Network User Role at the host project level would allow Engineering Group A to create and manage resources across all subnets in the host project, which is more than what is needed in this case. Compute Shared VPC Admin Role at either the host or service project level would give Engineering Group A too much control over the Shared VPC Network."

Build small containers using small base images.\nIt is indeed best practice, but I doubt if small base images can reduce the surface. It is still the same app version with the same vulnerabilities etc. \nC. Delete non-used versions from Container Registry.\nUnused, historical versions are additional attack surface. attacker can exploit old, unpatched image which indeed the surface extention.\nD. Use a Continuous Delivery tool to deploy the application.\nThis is just a method of image delivery. The app is the same."

Use the Organization Policy Service to create a compute.trustedimageProjects constraint on the organization level. List the trusted project as the whitelist in an allow operation.\n\nHere's why this option is appropriate:\n\nOrganization-Wide Control: Creating an organization-level constraint allows you to enforce the policy organization-wide, ensuring consistent image usage across all projects within the organization.\n\nWhitelist Approach: By listing the trusted project as a whitelist in an \"allow\" operation, you explicitly specify which project can be trusted as the source for boot disks. This is a more secure approach because it only allows specific trusted projects.\n\nDedicated Project: You mentioned that the images are stored in a dedicated project, and this option aligns with that requirement."

VM tags are a straightforward way to identify the role or purpose of a VM (like 'web', 'app', 'database'). When VMs are tagged appropriately, tag-based firewall rules can easily control which tiers can communicate with each other. For example, firewall rules can be set so that only VMs with the 'web' tag can communicate with VMs with the 'app' tag, and so on."

Even though the compute metadata server can hold sensitive values like ssh keys, there are limitations with respect to how much data you can put in there (reference A below). Secret manager also has a size limit on how much you can store. (reference B below). However, secret manager is explicitly said to be a good use case for Sensitive Configuration information (reference C below) which makes it the preferred answer.\n\nReferences:\nA- https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/setting-custom-metadata#limitations\nB- https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/quotas\nC- https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/overview#secret_manager"

Access Transparency logs capture the actions performed by Google Cloud administrators, allowing you to maintain an audit trail and verify cloud provider access. Access Approval requests allow you to approve or dismiss requests for access by Google employees working to support your service. By combining these features, you can gain greater oversight and control over your sensitive data on Google Cloud.\n\nPlease note that this is a high-level recommendation, and it is important to evaluate your specific requirements and consult the official Google Cloud documentation for detailed implementation guidance."

For data-containing resources of some Google Cloud services, this property also reflects the location where data is stored .

Install Google Cloud Directory Sync and connect it to Active Directory and Cloud Identity: Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) is used to synchronize user and group information from on-premises Active Directory to Google Cloud Identity. This step ensures that user and group information is consistent across both environments.\n\nE. Create Identity and Access Management (IAM) groups with permissions corresponding to each Active Directory group: Once the synchronization is set up, you can create IAM groups in Google Cloud that mirror the Active Directory groups. Assign permissions to these IAM groups based on the roles and access levels required for each group. This approach simplifies access management by aligning Google Cloud permissions with existing Active Directory groups."

Use date shifting with the context set to the unique ID of the test subject.\n\nDate shifting is a technique used to obfuscate date data by shifting all dates in a dataset by a random number of days, while preserving the intervals between the dates. By setting the context to the unique ID of the test subject, you ensure that the same random shift is applied to all dates for a given test subject, preserving the interval data. This method effectively obfuscates the specific dates, reducing the risk of bias, while still allowing for meaningful analysis of the data."

This ensures consistent security policies and makes it easier to enforce changes uniformly.\n\nAllow Internal IP Ranges: By configuring the firewall policy to allow connections only from internal IP ranges, you are implementing a \"default deny\" rule for external traffic, which is a security best practice. This effectively blocks traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere), helping to prevent open ports and unauthorized access."

It's usually recommended to follow the principle of least privilege and explicitly allow only necessary traffic.\n\nOption C (Create a Google Cloud Armor security policy to deny traffic from 0.0.0.0/0) is more suitable for web application security and might not be the most effective way to prevent open ports like OPEN_MYSQL_PORT.\n\nOption D (Create a firewall rule for each VPC to deny traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 with priority 0) would require creating and managing individual firewall rules for each VPC, which could be cumbersome and less efficient than using a hierarchical firewall policy at the organization level."

This can be used to ensure data residency requirements are met, as the secret data (payloads) will not be stored or replicated outside of the regions selected in the policy.\n\nThe automatic replication policy option (B and D) would not work because it replicates data across all regions in Google Cloud, which may violate the data residency requirements.\n\nCreating two secrets using Terraform (C) in different regions could work from a data residency standpoint, but it could lead to management issues as you would have two separate secrets to manage instead of one."
