This solution meets the business requirement of providing a secure and high-performance connection between on-premises systems and Google Cloud, as well as the technical requirement of maintaining regulatory compliance. It also helps to meet the requirement of providing consistent logging, log retention, monitoring, and alerting capabilities, as Dedicated Interconnect connections can be used in conjunction with Cloud Router to establish a connection between on-premises networks and Google Cloud VPC networks."

Move from a Pub/Sub subscriber pull model to a push model.\n\nExplanation:\nMoving from a pull model to a push model in Google Cloud Pub/Sub can help improve the latency in your application. In a push model, the messages are pushed from the Pub/Sub service to the subscriber application, reducing the time it takes for the application to receive messages. This can help mitigate the timeout errors that you are experiencing due to increased load on the application servers."

However, in the case of timeout errors, increasing the Total Timeout retry value would be a more effective solution, as it allows more time for the message to be successfully published and reduces the likelihood of encountering timeout errors."

This reduces the attack surface by making it more difficult for an attacker to target the nodes. Additionally, by using a private endpoint and configuring master authorized networks, you can further restrict access to the cluster to only authorized users and networks. This helps to ensure that only authorized users and systems can access the cluster and helps to prevent unauthorized access."

Similarly, using a private cluster with a public endpoint and master authorized networks can also provide some level of security, but it is not as secure as using a private cluster with a private endpoint and master authorized networks. In summary, to reduce the attack surface and follow best practices, it is recommended to use a private cluster with a private endpoint and configure master authorized networks."
