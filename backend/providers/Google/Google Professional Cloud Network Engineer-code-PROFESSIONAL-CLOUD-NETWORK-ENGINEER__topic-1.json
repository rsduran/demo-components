By setting the priority to 65500, this rule becomes one of the last rules to be evaluated, effectively serving as a catch-all rule after other rules have been checked.\n\nDeny All Traffic: This rule denies all traffic, including HTTP traffic, RDP traffic, and any other traffic. It acts as a safety net to catch and log any unexpected or unwanted traffic.\n\nEnable Logs: Enabling logging for this rule allows you to see entries in the firewall logs for any traffic that matches this rule."

You have not configured compression in Cloud CDN.\n\nCloud CDN supports content compression, but it must be explicitly enabled through the use of the Accept-Encoding header in HTTP requests. By default, Cloud CDN does not compress cacheable content. To enable compression, you need to configure your origin server to send compressed responses, add the Accept-Encoding header to your client requests, and enable content compression in the Cloud CDN configuration."

You can force an object or set of objects to be ignored by the cache by requesting a cache invalidation.\nPath patterns\nEach invalidation request specifies a path pattern that identifies the object or set of objects that should be invalidated. The path pattern can be either a specific path, such as /cat.jpg, or an entire directory structure, such as /pictures/*. The following rules apply to path patterns:\n\nThe path pattern must start with /.\nIt cannot include ? or #.\nIt must not include an * except as the final character following a /.\nIf it ends with /*, the preceding string is a prefix, and all objects whose paths begin with that prefix are invalidated."

This will remove all cached copies of any objects that begin with the prefix folder-a. Using a cache invalidation command is the quickest way to remove cached copies of objects, and it is not necessary to disable Cloud CDN or change the sharing settings of the objects.

Because policy-based routing is used, traffic must be sent to the IP address of the Cloud VPN gateway so that the appropriate policy can be applied and the traffic can be forwarded to the on-premises resource. Therefore, the next hop for the static route should be the IP address of the Cloud VPN gateway."

Although you can create a firewall rule applicable to other protocols, you cannot log their connections.\nYou cannot enable Firewall Rules Logging for the implied deny ingress and implied allow egress rules.\nLog entries are written from the perspective of virtual machine (VM) instances. Log entries are only created if a firewall rule has logging enabled and if the rule applies to traffic sent to or from the VM. Entries are created according to the connection logging limits on a best effort basis.\nThe number of connections that can be logged in a given interval is based on the machine type.\nChanges to firewall rules can be viewed in VPC audit logs.\n\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewall-rules-logging#specifications"

This is because the VPC network that hosts the controller is owned by Google and cannot be accessed from resources connected through another VPC network peering connection, Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect.\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/solutions/creating-kubernetes-engine-private-clusters-with-net-proxies"

However, Cloud NAT does not work if a VM has a route that directs its outbound traffic through a VPN tunnel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Add a default static route to the VPC with the default internet gateway as the next hop, the network tag associated with the Compute Engine instances, and a higher priority than the priority of the default route to the VPN tunnel. This option allows you to override the default route that directs all traffic through the VPN tunnel for only those instances that have a specific network tag. This way, those instances can use Cloud NAT for their outbound traffic."

Dry run mode is used to test perimeter configuration and to monitor usage of services without preventing access to resources. Common use cases include:\n\nDetermining the impact that changes to existing service perimeters will have.\n\nPreviewing the impact that new service perimeters will have.\n\nMonitoring requests to protected services that originate from outside a service perimeter. For example, seeing where requests to a given service are coming from, or to identify unexpected service usage in your organization.\n\nIn your development environments, creating an analogous perimeter architecture to your production environment. This allows you to identify and mitigate any issues that will be caused by your service perimeters before pushing changes to your production environment.\n\nService perimeters can exist using dry run mode exclusively.

To calculate it, just multiply the pods per node number * 2 and select the upper closer CIDR. 8 * 2 = 16, which fits into a /28 CIDR which has exactly 16 addresses. A 10 nodes cluster will require then 160 addresses which only fits in a /24 CIDR and above, so the only answer that match is the D. The other CIDR calculation match, even the services one. It uses a /22 CIDR and like it doesn't requires to reserve the network and broadcast addresses, it match the 1024 requirement.\n\nBest regards"

In this case, the question mentions that the packet loss investigation is for traffic flows starting in VPC A and terminating in VPC B.\n\nSince the traffic is originating from VPC A and terminating in VPC B, you should look in Project B for the reported metric, as this is where the traffic terminates. This makes options A and C incorrect.\n\nNow, you need to ensure that each zone in each of the VPC networks has at least 9 compute instances to provide a sufficient sample size for statistical analysis with a 90% confidence level. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Ensure that each zone in each of the VPC networks has at least 9 compute instances. Look in Project B for the reported metric."

BGP enables dynamic routing between the on-premises network and Google Cloud, allowing for automatic failover in case one VPN gateway or tunnel becomes unavailable. This ensures continuous connectivity between the two VPCs with minimal downtime.\n\nOptions A, B, and C use Classic VPN, which is not recommended for new deployments as it lacks certain features such as high availability and dynamic routing.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most suitable choice for ensuring maximum availability and following Google-recommended practices."
