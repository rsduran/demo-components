For example, if you have two applications, \"app1\" and \"app2\", each with a development and production environment, you would have four projects: app1-dev, app1-prod, app2-dev, app2-prod. This isolates the environments from each other, so changes to the development project do not accidentally impact production, and gives you better access control, since you can (for example) grant all developers access to development projects but restrict production access to your CI/CD pipeline.\"\n\nThe answer is C."

It also provides insight into the success of their expansion efforts in Asia.\nError Rates: Tracking error rates is crucial for ensuring service availability and support. It directly relates to the goal of guaranteeing availability by identifying and resolving issues that could lead to service disruptions.\nLatency from Asia: Monitoring latency specifically for users in Asia addresses the technical goal of decreasing latency in this region. It's a direct measure of the performance improvements and user experience enhancements expected from the cloud migration."
