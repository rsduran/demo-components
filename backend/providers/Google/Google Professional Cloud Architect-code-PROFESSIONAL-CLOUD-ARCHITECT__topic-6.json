        "content": "I think the answer is B and here is my reasoning.\n\nUsers never communicate with the Backend server (due to security reasons) there is always a Frontend Service that is open to the internet and FE Service communicates with BE Server. The reason they called it Backend Serer is since it must have a Front end server refer to the solution reference (https://reviewnprep.com/blog/gcp-how-to-work-on-mountkirk-games-case-study/)\n\nthe traffic flow should look like this...... User(mobile) -&gt; FE Game Server (hosted in GCP) -&gt; BE Server (hosted in GCP)\n\nSince BE Service is not exposed to the internet therefore we would require a regional  L4 Balancer since regional Load Balancer is NOT internet facing and it's from VM to VM"
