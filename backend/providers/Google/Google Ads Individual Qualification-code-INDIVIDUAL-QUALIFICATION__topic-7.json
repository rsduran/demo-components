    "answerDescription": "There is an important difference between Goal conversions and ecommerce transactions. A Goal conversion can only be counted once during a visit, but an ecommerce transaction can be counted multiple times during a visit. Lets say that you set one of your Goals to be a PDF download and you define it such that any PDF download is a valid Goal conversion. And lets also say that the Goal is worth $5. In this case, if a user comes to your site and downloads five PDF files during a single session, youll only get one conversion worth $5. However, if you were to track each of these downloads as a $5 ecommerce transaction, you would see five transactions and $25 in ecommerce revenue.",
