The question mentions \"integer form\" as a distraction to trick you into picking \"integer\" as the answer.\n\nList of String versus Array of String? Which is better? Remember that only Lists have dynamic size. That means you can add employee ID's to them in a \"For Each\" loop, one by one. It's much more difficult to do that with Arrays, because Arrays have fixed size. You add a value to an Array of 5 items, so now you have 6 items total. Check the length of the Array, and it will tell you that you still have 5 items in there. You can write janky code to manually update the size of the array to 6, but it's obvious that is not ideal when Lists have this functionality built-in already."

This allows the invoked workflow to modify the value of the variable and pass it back to the calling workflow.\n\nFor the \"In/Out\" argument, you can also only provide a Variable.
