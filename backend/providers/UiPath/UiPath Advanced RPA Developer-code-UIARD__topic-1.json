It is an abstract machine consisting of a finite number of pre-defined states and transitions between these states. At any point, based on the external inputs and conditions verified, it can be in only one of the states. \n\nState machines can be used with a finite number of clear and stable states to go through. Some examples from your daily life include vending machines, elevators or traffic lights.\n\nState machines are not to be overused - they should define only the skeleton of the project."
