In Communications Mining, this relates to the proportion of messages in the dataset that have informative label predictions, and is presented in Validation as a percentage score.\n\n'Informative labels' are those labels that the platform understands to be useful as standalone labels, by looking at how frequently they're assigned with other labels. Labels that are always assigned with another label, e.g. parent labels that are never assigned on their own or 'Urgent' if it's always assigned with another label, are down-weighted when the score is calculated.\n\nThe visual below gives an indication of what low coverage versus high coverage would look like across an entire dataset. Imagine the shaded circles are messages that have informative label predictions."

Apart from this, you can use data labeling for human validation on model outputs.\n\nA common scenario is when you train an extractor or classifier model. When the model prediction falls below a set confidence threshold, that data can be sent to Action Center for human validation. The validated data can be used to retrain the model in order to improve confidence on subsequent model predictions.\n\nhttps://docs.uipath.com/ai-center/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/using-data-labeling-with-human-in-the-loop"
