Several changes were made:\nTransactionItem variable type changed to DataRow, instead of QueueItem.\nInput data is read in the Init state and kept in memory in the TransactionData variable.\nGetTransactionData workflow was changed accordingly to get a DataRow from input data based in Transaction Number."
