In this example, the team is using Scrum for the inner loop.

Determining if business needs meet the Portfolio Threshold\n\nOne component of a Guardrail in Lean Portfolio Management is determining if business needs meet the Portfolio Threshold. In the context of Lean Portfolio Management (LPM), Guardrails are policy guidelines or criteria that help organizations make decisions regarding the allocation of budgets and resources to various value streams, programs, or initiatives. These Guardrails can include criteria such as ensuring that business needs meet a certain threshold or level of strategic alignment, which helps in making investment decisions and prioritizing work within the portfolio."
