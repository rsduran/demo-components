This prevents configuration conflicts if we lose connectivity between the nodes in our cluster. So, if we have only 2 racks and 4 nodes we could never get more than half of the nodes available if one of those racks power fails. We need 6 nodes separated on 3 racks, so we can have more than half of the nodes available if one of those racks power fails."

If the connectivity between two equal portions of a large cluster fails, the group of nodes containing epsilon maintains quorum, assuming that all of the nodes are healthy. For example, the following illustration shows a four-node cluster in which two of the nodes have failed. However, because one of the surviving nodes holds epsilon, the cluster remains in quorum even though there is not a simple majority of healthy nodes.\nhttps://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/health-checker/concept_understand_quorum_and_epsilon.html"
