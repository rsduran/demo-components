Option B is ambiguous because it doesn't specify whether the existing 3232C switches are dedicated switches for the existing two NS224C shelves, or are the cluster switches.  If they are dedicated storage switches the new shelves could be attached to them. If they are the cluster switches, they cannot be (in ONTAP 9.8).  Option C is correct.

NetAppDocs\nExplanation:\n-  NetAppDocs is the primary resource for NetApp documentation, including technical guides, troubleshooting tips, and best practices. It provides comprehensive information on various NetApp products and solutions.\n - Active IQ Unified Manager is a cloud-based management tool that provides insights into the health and performance of NetApp systems. It can help identify issues but may not provide detailed troubleshooting steps.\n-  Active IQ One Collect is a tool used to collect data from NetApp systems for analysis. It can be helpful for identifying trends and anomalies but may not provide specific solutions.\n -  NET2 is a command-line interface for configuring and managing NetApp systems. While it can be used to troubleshoot issues, it may not provide the level of detail needed for a complex problem like disk ownership.\nTherefore, NetAppDocs would be the most appropriate tool to access documentation and guidelines for solving the issue of all drives being assigned to node 1 in a 2-node AFF A700 installation."
