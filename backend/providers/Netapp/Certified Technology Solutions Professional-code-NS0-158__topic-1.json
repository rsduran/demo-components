    "answerDescription": "DE: NetApp deduplication is an integral part of the NetApp Data ONTAP operating environment and the WAFL file system, which manages all data on NetApp storage systems.<br>NetApp data compression, introduced in Data ONTAP 8.0.1, is highly complementary to deduplication.<br>A: Data within a FlexVol has both a logical location within the volume and a physical location within the containing aggregate. When reading data from a FlexVol, the physical location of that data must be known to perform the read. Under normal circumstances, reads use a fast-path to translate a logical address into a physical address. When SnapMirror transfers a FlexVol to a different aggregate, however, the relationship between logical and physical addresses is changed.<br>The destination aggregate lays out the volume into different physical blocks. Immediately after the SnapMirror transfer, reads to the destination volume will use a different process to translate logical addresses into physical addresses. This slow-path is less efficient and may require an additional disk read to access a block of data. As soon as a FlexVol SnapMirror update finishes, the destination storage controller will launch a scanner to recreate the fast-path metadata. Once the scan finishes, reads to the SnapMirror destination will use the normal fast-path. This process is known as deswizzling.<br>References:<br>http://community.netapp.com/t5/Tech-OnTap-Articles/Back-to-Basics-Deduplication/ta-p/84888 https://kb.netapp.com/support/s/article/ka21A0000000arxQAA/what-is-deswizzler-or-deswizzling?language=en_US",
