Flow control can be useful to prevent packet loss and congestion in some scenarios, but it can also cause performance degradation and latency in others1\n\nAccording to the NetApp best practices, flow control should be disabled on cluster network ports in the ONTAP cluster. This is because flow control can interfere with the cluster heartbeat mechanism and cause unnecessary failovers or false alarms\n\nFlow control should also be disabled on data network ports in the ONTAP cluster, especially when using SMB protocol. This is because SMB is sensitive to latency and flow control can introduce delays and jitter in the data transmission."

To ensure that the LIF only fails over to the correct ports after network maintenance in the given scenario, you should create an IPspace.\nAn IPspace is a logical container that isolates network traffic on a NetApp cluster. An IPspace separates network traffic for different purposes or tenants, enabling separate failover and routing policies for each IPspace. By creating an IPspace for the LIF, you can ensure that it only fails over to the correct ports, as the IPspace will only allow the LIF to use the ports that are assigned to it.\nChanging the LIF's failover policy to sfo-partner-only would limit the failover of the LIF to the partner node only, but it would not ensure that the LIF only fails over to the correct ports. Splitting the broadcast domain or creating a DNS load balancing zone would not address the issue of the LIF failing over to incorrect ports."

Increasing the size of the volume will increase the amount of space available for storing data, but it will not directly affect the number of files that can be created.\n\nB. Setting the space guarantee to \"volume\" ensures that all of the space in the volume is reserved for use by the volume. This can increase the number of files that can be created in the volume.\n\nC. Setting the fractional reserve to \"0\" means that no space is reserved for the volume. This can lead to overprovisioning and can cause issues with file creation.\n\nD. Increasing the number of files permitted on the volume directly affects the number of files that can be created in the volume. This can be done by adjusting the \"maxfiles\" parameter on the volume."

ONTAP supports two methods of 2FA: public key and SAML. Public key authentication uses a pair of cryptographic keys (one public and one private) to verify the user\u2019s identity. SAML authentication uses a web-based protocol that allows users to log in to an application by using a secure identity provider (IdP). Both methods are required to set up 2FA for the ONTAP CLI. IPsec and password are not2FA methods, as they only provide one factor of authentication. References :- Set up multifactor authentication, TR-4647: Multifactor Authentication in ONTAP"
