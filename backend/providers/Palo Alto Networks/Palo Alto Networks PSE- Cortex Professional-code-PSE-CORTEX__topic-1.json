This is particularly useful for scenarios where continuous monitoring or periodic checks are necessary until a certain outcome is achieved, such as verifying if an external process is complete or waiting for a response from an integrated system.\n\nPlaybook tasks: Within playbooks, tasks can be configured to loop based on conditions. This includes conditional tasks that can re-execute a group of tasks depending on the results of previous tasks. Sub-playbooks can also be looped through, which involves configuring the sub-playbook to repeat until a condition is satisfied or a maximum number of iterations is reached."

Here are two statements that apply to widgets in Cortex XDR:\n\nWidgets provide a visual summary of security incidents by displaying data such as the number of incidents generated over a specific timeframe (e.g., 24h/7d/30d), which can differ from the incident table due to filters like incident status1.\nWidgets can show discrepancies in data when compared to manual checks, such as showing a different number of incidents within the same timeframe, which may be due to the resolution status of incidents not being reflected in the widget\u2019s data1.\nThese widgets help security teams to quickly understand the current threat landscape and prioritize their response actions accordingly."

This convention helps in clearly segregating logs for different tenants, making it easier for administrators to manage and troubleshoot issues specific to each tenant.\n\nOn the other hand, /var/log/demisto/Tenant1/server.log does not follow the standard naming convention used in multi-tenant environments for Cortex XSOAR, which includes the acc_ prefix to indicate tenant accounts."
