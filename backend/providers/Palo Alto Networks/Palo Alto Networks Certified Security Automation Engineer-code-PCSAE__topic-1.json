You can configure integrations in Cortex XSOAR to fetch event data from various sources, such as a SIEM, EDR, a firewall, and other security systems and services.\n\nStage Two: Incident Object Creation\nCortex XSOAR uses the event data fetched by an integration to create an incident object and populates it with raw event data.\n\nStage Three: Classification\nCortex XSOAR identifies the type of incident based on the classifier object selected in the integration configuration settings. If you have not selected any classifier, then the integration uses the default classifier of the integration. Cortex XSOAR will identify an incident as Unclassified if no default classifier exists or if the type of an incident cannot be identified.\n\nStage Four: Mapping\nThe raw event data ingested by an integration gets mapped to existing fields in Cortex XSOAR. The fields display incident data to analysts in the Cortex XSOAR graphical user interface (GUI).\nIngestion &gt;&gt; Incident Creation &gt;&gt; Classification &gt;&gt; Mapping is the 100% correct answer"

You can also configure the fields to appear in rows or as cards. For example, if you know that some of the field values will be very long, you are better off using rows. If you know that the field values are short, you might want to use cards so you can fit more fields in a section. If a field label is very long, you can select to wrap the label so that you can see the full name of the field."
