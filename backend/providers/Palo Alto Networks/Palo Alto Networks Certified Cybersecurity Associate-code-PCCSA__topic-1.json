Acting independently or as part of a criminal organization, cybercriminals commit acts of data theft, embezzlement, fraud, and/or extortion for financial gain. \n\n\u2022 State-affiliated groups. Sponsored by or affiliated with nation-states, these organizations have the resources to launch very sophisticated and persistent attacks, have great technical depth and focus, and are well funded. They often have military and/or strategic objectives such as the ability to disable or destroy critical infrastructure, including power grids, water supplies, transportation systems, emergency response, and medical and industrial systems."
