However, based on the given options, the most appropriate choice would be:\n\nC. Add the signer to the allow list in the malware profile.\n\nBy adding the digital signer to the allow list in the malware profile, you are essentially telling the Cortex XDR Agent to trust files signed by that specific signer and allow their execution without being blocked.\n\nIt's worth noting that cybersecurity measures and software configurations can change over time, so it's essential to refer to the official documentation or the latest guidelines provided by the product's vendor for the most up-to-date information. Additionally, configuring security software requires careful consideration and should be performed by knowledgeable and authorized personnel to ensure the system's security."

I had wondered if they possibly got the question mistranscribed from the source.  Anyone have any other sources?

To combat these attacks, Cortex XDR employs decoy files to attract the ransomware. When the ransomware attempts to write to, rename, move, delete, or encrypt the decoy files, the Cortex XDR agent analyzes the behavior and prevents the ransomware from encrypting and holding files hostage. When configured to operate in Prevention Mode, the Cortex XDR agent blocks the process attempting to manipulate the decoy files. When you configure this module in Notification Mode, the agent logs a security event."

This type of communication allows data transfers in real-time by keeping sessions for a longer durations. When you perform one of these critical response actions from the Cortex XDR management console, the Cortex XDR instance establishes a session between the instance itself and the targeted endpoint. Then, the session is kept alive even after the response action is complete. Live Terminal is among these response actions."
