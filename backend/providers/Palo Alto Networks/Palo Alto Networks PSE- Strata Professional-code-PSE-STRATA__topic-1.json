Specifically, it effectively prevents the following four stages:\n\n- Breach the Perimeter: By using advanced threat prevention mechanisms, the platform can stop initial attempts to penetrate the network perimeter. \n\n- Lateral Movement: Once inside the network, attackers often try to move laterally to access more systems. The platform uses network segmentation and advanced monitoring to detect and prevent such movements.\n\n- Exfiltrate Data: Data exfiltration is the process of unauthorized data transfer out of the network. The platform employs data loss prevention (DLP) technologies to detect and block such attempts.\n\n- Deliver the Malware: The platform can prevent malware delivery through its threat prevention capabilities, including anti-malware, anti-spyware, and sandboxing technologies.\n\nThese steps cover critical phases where the platform can intervene to stop attacks before they cause significant damage."

As WildFire identifies unknown malware, zero-day exploits, and advanced persistent threats (APTs), the PAN-DB database is updated with information on malicious URLs so that you can block malware downloads and disable Command and Control (C2) communications to protect your network from cyberthreats. URL categories that identify confirmed malicious content \u05d2\u20ac\" malware, phishing, and C2 are updated every five minutes \u05d2\u20ac\" to ensure that you can manage access to these sites within minutes of categorization",

These approaches share a common problem,\nhowever: they lack consistent and predictable performance when security services are enabled. Specifically, the base firewall functions can perform at high throughput and low latency, but when added security functions are enabled, performance decreases while latency increases. More importantly, these traditional approaches to integration limit security capabilities because a \u201csequence of functions\u201d approach is inherently less flexible than one in which all functions share information and enforcement mechanisms.\nPalo Alto Networks Single-Pass Architecture addresses these performance and flexibility challenges with a unique single-pass approach to packet processing, delivering better\nperformance and security.\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/whitepapers/single-pass-parallel-processing-architecture"
