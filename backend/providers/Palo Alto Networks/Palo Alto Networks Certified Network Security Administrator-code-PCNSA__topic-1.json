Security policies define how traffic is handled, and security profiles provide additional security measures like antivirus scanning or URL filtering. You can attach security profiles to security policies to extend their functionality.\nD. Security policy rules inspect but do not block traffic. Security policy rules can perform inspections on traffic based on various criteria (source, destination, application, etc.). Based on the match criteria and the defined action (allow or deny), they can either permit or block traffic flow.\nE. Security policy rules can block or allow traffic. This is the core functionality of security policies. They evaluate traffic against defined criteria and dictate whether to permit or deny its passage through the firewall. C. Security Profiles should be used only on allowed traffic. Security profiles can be applied to both allowed and denied traffic. For example, you might want to perform antivirus scanning on all traffic, even traffic that is ultimately blocked by the security policy."

The PPA not only helps to identify all security risks, it also provides detailed suggestions on how to prevent the risks and close the gaps. The assessment, guided by an experienced Palo Alto Networks sales engineer, helps determine the areas of greatest risk where you should focus prevention activities. You can run the PPA on firewalls and on Panorama.\""

An alternative to using the MGT interface is to configure a data port (a regular interface) to access these services. The path from the interface to the service on a server is known as a service route.\nWhen configured as a DNS proxy, the firewall is an intermediary between DNS clients and servers; it acts as a DNS server itself by resolving queries from its DNS proxy cache. If it doesn\u2019t find the domain name in its DNS proxy cache, the firewall searches for a match to the domain name among the entries in the specific DNS proxy object (on the interface on which the DNS query arrived). The firewall forwards the query to the appropriate DNS server based on the match results. If no match is found, the firewall uses default DNS servers."

For this reason, deployment of the Windows agent at remote sites and having them forward the relevant User-ID information to firewall on a central network often is beneficial."

In the wildcard mask, a zero (0) bit indicates that the bit being compared must match the bit in the IP address that is covered by the 0. A one (1) bit in the mask is a wildcard bit, meaning the bit being compared need not match the bit in the IP address that is covered by the 1. Convert the IP address and the wildcard mask to binary. To illustrate the matching: on binary snippet 0011, a wildcard mask of 1010 results in four matches (0001, 0011, 1001, and 1011)."

This is because there are no such fields as \"packets sent / packets received\" in the detailed log view of a session. But the fields for  \"Action\" and \"Protocol\" does exist. Based on the article, if protocol is UDP then aged out reason is ok and can be ignored, the opposite is true for TCP which a session of aged out warrants further investigation."

This list of signatures allows you to defend against an array of threats using DNS in real-time against newly generated malicious domains.

Thus, in New App Viewer, at times we get to see numbers under 'Apps Allowed' whereas on the other hand this column contains 'Any'. Moreover, the New Apps Allowed functionality requires PA Application Cloud Engine (ACE) SaaS subscription to get the App info from cloud DB. The Rules Without Apps Control is on-the-box functionality. Here's the definition from firewall's help page;\nNew App Viewer\u2014New cloud applications downloaded from the Application Control Engine if the firewall has a SaaS Security subscription.\nRules Without App Controls\u2014Rules that have the application set to any, so you can identify port-based rules to convert to application-based rules."

You can create virtual wire subinterfaces to classify traffic according to an IP address, IP range, or subnet. A virtual wire requires no changes to adjacent network devices. A virtual wire can bind two Ethernet interfaces of the same medium (both copper or both fiber optic), or bind a copper interface to a fiber optic interface.\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/network/network-interfaces/virtual-wire-interface"

In general, the DoS Protection profile sets the thresholds at which the firewall generates a DoS alarm, takes action such as Random Early Drop, and drops additional incoming connections. A DoS Protection policy rule configured to protect (rather than to allow or deny packets) determines the criteria for packets to match (such as source address) in order to be counted toward the thresholds. This flexibility allows you to block certain traffic, or allow certain traffic and treat other traffic as DoS traffic. When the incoming rate exceeds your maximum threshold, the firewall blocks incoming traffic from the source address."

By operating cloud-based detection engines, you can access a wide array of detection mechanisms that are updated and deployed automatically without requiring the user to download update packages or operate process intensive, firewall-based analyzers which can sap resources. Inline cloud analysis for your firewall Vulnerability Protection profile supports two analysis engines: SQL injection and Command injection. Additional analysis models are delivered through content updates, however, enhancements to existing models are performed as a cloud-side update, requiring no firewall update. Inline cloud analysis is enabled and configured using the Vulnerability Protection profile and requires an active Advanced Threat Prevention license."

Deny WMI traffic from the User-ID agent to any external zone1\n\nWMI, or Windows Management Instrumentation, is a mechanism that can be used to actively probe managed Windows systems to learn IP-user mappings1. Because WMI probing trusts data reported back from the endpoint, it is not a recommended method of obtaining User-ID information in a high-security network1. On sensitive and high-security networks, WMI probing increases the overall attack surface, and administrators are recommended to disable WMI probing and instead rely upon User-ID mappings obtained from more isolated and trusted sources, such as domain controllers"

Panorama is a centralized management tool for Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and it allows administrators to configure and manage both pre-rules and local device rules for managed firewalls.\n\nC. Pre-rules are part of the security policy and can be viewed on managed firewalls. They define policies for traffic before it is matched against security policy rules.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pre-rules are typically managed and modified in Panorama, not on individual firewalls. Panorama administrators can modify pre-rules, but the local administrator on a firewall usually doesn't modify pre-rules directly.\n\nOption D is incorrect because pre-rules can be modified in Panorama, and local device rules can also be modified in Panorama for centralized management. Local device rules are specific to the individual firewall but can still be managed through Panorama."

The first step is to enter the route and netmask for the destination network, such as 192.168.2.2/24 for an IPv4 address or 2001:db8:123:1::1/64 for an IPv6 address. The second step is to enter the IP address for the specific next hop, such as 192.168.56.1 or 2001:db8:49e:1::1. The third step is to specify the outgoing interface for packets to use to go to the next hop, such as ethernet1/1. The fourth step is to add an IPv4 or IPv6 route by name, such as route11.

The mapping is not port based, which makes this a one-to-one mapping as long as the session lasts.....\n\nStatic IP: Use this translation type to translate a single source address to a specific public address. This is typically used to expose a server (email, web or any application) externally using a translated address that will not change. Use the Static IP mapping type to translate an entire address range to a specific address range, a one-to-one mapping. The number of source IPs using this policy must exactly match the translated range. This is typically used to resolve overlapping IP ranges when merging networks. The policy shown here translates all source addresses with at 10.20.1.x address destined to the Corp Zone to a matching address in the 10.30.1.x range."
