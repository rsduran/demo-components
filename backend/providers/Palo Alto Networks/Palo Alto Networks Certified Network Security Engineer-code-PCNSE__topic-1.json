The 'web-browsing' application represents HTTP traffic, and the 'application-default' service includes TCP ports commonly used for HTTP traffic, including port 8080.

A indicates that \"after app has been identified\", so we can interpret that in the Flow Diagram as the step in App-ID which says \"Pattern based application identification\" however, considering the Packet Flow Sequence, after the app is identified, there are still several steps that don't lead directly to Content ID. First it checks for policy matches that will allow it (so it might still get dropped). Then it will check if there are any Security Profiles (ContentID) that will be applicable. QoS and SSL Decryption also might occur at this point. My point is there's a whole bunch of stuff still going on between the \"app being identified\" and content inspection. \n\nMy conclusion is that whenever content inspection is performed it's always before packet forwarding. And it is not always the case that it happens immediatly after the app has been identified."

In option D, the first Security policy rule allows web-browsing traffic on the HTTPS service (service-https), which is not applicable in this scenario since the web server is configured to host its contents over HTTP(S) and is listening on TCP port 443 for incoming connections.\n\nIf we allow the web-browsing application traffic using the HTTPS service, the firewall will forward the traffic to the web server without decrypting it, since it is HTTPS traffic. However, the web server is hosting its contents over HTTP(S), so the firewall needs to decrypt the traffic before forwarding it to the web server.\n\nTherefore, the correct service to be used in the first Security policy rule is service-http instead of service-https. This will allow the firewall to decrypt the traffic before forwarding it to the web server and also allow web-browsing traffic from the Trust zone to the DMZ zone.\nHence, option B is the correct answer."

Some applications, however, require the firewall to dynamically open pinholes to establish the connection, determine the parameters for the session and negotiate the ports that will be used for the transfer of data; these applications use the application-layer payload to communicate the dynamic TCP or UDP ports on which the application opens data connections. For such applications, the firewall serves as an Application Level Gateway (ALG), and it opens a pinhole for a limited time and for exclusively transferring data or control traffic. The firewall also performs a NAT rewrite of the payload when necessary.\n\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/app-id/application-level-gateways#"

It is far easier to check if a session was decrypted by checking the Traffic Log. \n\nIt is clear here in the PAN-OS 10 Admin guide, section \"Verify Decryption\", that to check the Traffic Log to verify if decryption happened. Silly enough it also states in the very same document that you can check the decryption log (but, it seems to miss out that only for decryption failures).\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/decryption/verify-decryption.html\n\nHere is the link for Decryption Log, you will read that it only logs unsuccessful decryption attempts. \nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/decryption/troubleshoot-and-monitor-decryption/decryption-logs.html#idb1b7e4a6-b48c-4ca7-8569-b785da780dd6\n\nNow I am not running PAN-OS 10 in the real world so I can't say 100% but reading off the documentation, that is how I would answer the question."

Each router has a [data plane], which holds the information, and a [control plane], which tells the data where to go. Where data flows is typically determined by a network engineer or administrator who writes rules and policies, often manually, for each router on the network \u2013 a process that can be time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nSD-WAN separates the control and management processes from the underlying networking hardware, making them available as software that can be easily configured and deployed. A centralized control pane means network administrators can write new rules and policies, and then configure and deploy them across an entire network at once.\n\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-sd-wan"

When the firewall trusts the CA that signed the certificate of the destination server, the firewall can send a copy of the destination server certificate to the client, signed by the enterprise CA. This is a best practice because usually all network devices already trust the Enterprise CA (it is usually already installed in the devices\u2019 CA Trust storage), so you don\u2019t need to deploy the certificate on the endpoints, so the rollout process is smoother.\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-1/pan-os-admin/decryption/configure-ssl-forward-proxy.html"

Ticking the option above DISABLES that function forcing Panorama to only send objects that are used by the members of service groups. I swear a lot of PAN articles need proper grammar checks as they confuse learners. Even the aforementioned phrase should be changed to something like:\n\n\"DISABLE sharing unused address and service objects with devices\"\n\nSee how much more clear that option now is? I think I will contact PAN customer support to factor this change. PAN tech is complicated enough, we don't need overly complicated grammar to make it even worse to understand!!!!!"

Therefore, it's crucial to have a solution capable of decrypting both inbound traffic and outbound traffic, whether it's directed towards trusted or untrusted destinations.\n\nIn this context, a decryption profile stands out as the most comprehensive solution. By attaching a decryption profile to the decryption policy rule, it ensures that all traffic matching the rule undergoes decryption, regardless of whether it's inbound or outbound, and regardless of the trust status of the destination server's certificate.\n\nHence, considering the broad scope of traffic mentioned in the question, Option A, which emphasizes the importance of a decryption profile, appears to be the most appropriate choice."

When a user connects to GlobalProtect, their identity is verified against an LDAP server. This ensures that all IP address-to-user mappings are explicitly known.\n\nThe other options are not as secure as GlobalProtect.\n\nOption A, LDAP Server Profile configuration, allows for the configuration of multiple LDAP servers. This can make it difficult to track all IP address-to-user mappings.\nOption C, Windows-based User-ID agent, relies on the Windows operating system to provide user identity. This can be less secure than using an LDAP server, as the Windows operating system is more susceptible to attack.\nOption D, PAN-OS integrated User-ID agent, uses a local database to store user mappings. This database can be easily compromised, making it less secure than using an LDAP server."

You can also use certificates when excluding servers from SSL decryption for technical reasons (the site breaks decryption for reasons such as certificate pinning, unsupported ciphers, or mutual authentication).

Global packet buffer protection (Device-&gt;Setup-&gt;Session) is to protect firewall resources and ensure that malicious traffic does not cause the firewall to become non-responsive.\nPacket buffer protection per ingress zone (Network-&gt;Zones) is a second layer of protection that starts blocking the offending IP address if it continues to exceed the packet buffer protection thresholds. \nThe most effective way to block DoS attacks against a service behind the firewall is to configure packet buffer protection globally and per ingress zone.\nYou can Enable Packet Buffer Protection for a zone, but it is not active until you enable packet buffer protection globally and specify the settings."

No additional hardware needed, just an SD-WAN subscription. You may have cloud-based services and instead of having your internet traffic flow from branches to the hub to the cloud, you want the internet traffic to flow directly from branches to the cloud using a directly connected ISP. Such access from a branch to the internet is Direct Internet Access (DIA). Use DIA on branches for SaaS, web browsing, or heavy-bandwidth applications that shouldn\u2019t be backhauled to a hub. This ties to the mention of \"offloading\" at each site."

An alternative to using the MGT interface is to configure a data port (a regular interface) to access these services. The path from the interface to the service on a server is known as a service route. The service packets exit the firewall on the port assigned for the external service and the server sends its response to the configured source interface and source IP address."

However, the verdict of Wildfire is independent of the action of the security rule. if it is set to alert or allow, it will allow the traffic even if the verdict is malicious due that is not instant process ( which means in real -time the traffic won't get block ) now , this is a nasty question due that the columns has file and wildfire , for the wildfire rows , we have allow as an action and \" allow\"  doesn't log any of the traffic but alert yes.

Since the actual server resides in the Trust-L3 zone (192.168.15.47), the NAT rule should translate the destination IP from Untrust-L3 to Trust-L3.\nB correctly translates the destination IP address 172.16.15.1 (given by DNS) to 192.168.15.47 and sets the destination zone to Trust-L3, where the web server resides.\nSecurity Rule:\nA uses 172.16.15.1 as the destination IP in the security rule. However, after NAT translation, the destination IP will be 192.168.15.47. This mismatch will result in the traffic being denied because the security rule won't match the translated IP.\nB uses 192.168.15.47 as the destination IP in the security rule, which matches the post-NAT translated IP, ensuring the rule correctly allows the traffic.\nConclusion:\nOption B correctly sets the NAT rule to translate the external IP to the internal IP within the Trust-L3 zone and uses the correct translated IP in the security rule to allow the traffic. This makes B the correct configuration."

A syslog listener is a feature that enables the firewall or Panorama to receive syslog messages from other systems and parse them for IP address-to-username mappings. A syslog listener can collect user mapping information from a variety of sources, such as network access control systems, domain controllers, MDM solutions, VPN gateways, wireless controllers, proxies, and more. A syslog listener can also support multiple platforms and operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Therefore, a syslog listener can provide a comprehensive and flexible solution for User-ID deployment in a large-scale network.

This will ensure that the configurations are pushed to the devices at the specified time.\nSchedule an API Call to Commit Changes: Separately schedule an API call (such as a REST API call) to commit all the changes made in Panorama. This API call should trigger the commit process in Panorama to save all configuration changes. This step should be scheduled to occur before or after the scheduled Config Push, depending on your specific workflow.\n\nThis combination of scheduled Config Push and a separate API call to commit changes allows you to control and automate the process of ensuring that all configurations are committed and pushed to the devices at the desired time. It provides flexibility and control over the commit and push operations."

Each log will have two copies and each copy will reside on a different Log Collector. For example, if you have two Log Collectors in the collector group the log is written to both Log Collectors.\nEnabling redundancy creates more logs and therefore requires more storage capacity, reducing storage capability in half. When a Collector Group runs out of space, it deletes older logs. Redundancy also doubles the log processing traffic in a Collector Group, which reduces its maximum logging rate by half, as each Log Collector must distribute a copy of each log it receives."

The \"enabling Forward segments that exceed the TCP App-ID inspection queue\" is DISABELD by default, which means if you enable Jumbo frames on the firewall, and send large amount of traffic, the firewall should start dropping these packets with the default setting. I've seen the comments that there was a bug in previous PAN-OS versions where enabling Jumbo frames would display the same symptoms, but I don't think we can/should answer based on previous bugs, especially that the exam focuses on recent PAN-OS versions."

When the egress guaranteed bandwidth is exceeded, the firewall passes traffic on a best-effort basis. Bandwidth that is guaranteed but is unused continues to remain available for all traffic. Depending on your QoS configuration, you can guarantee bandwidth for a single QoS class, for all or some clear text traffic, and for all or some tunneled traffic.\nExample:\nClass 1 traffic has 5 Gbps of egress guaranteed bandwidth, which means that 5 Gbps is available but is not reserved for class 1 traffic. If Class 1 traffic does not use or only partially uses the guaranteed bandwidth, the remaining bandwidth can be used by other classes of traffic. However, during high traffic periods, 5 Gbps of bandwidth is absolutely available for class 1 traffic. During these periods of congestion, any Class 1 traffic that exceeds 5 Gbps is best effort\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/quality-of-service/qos-concepts/qos-bandwidth-management"

They're exceeding their guaranteed througput, so this doesnt really apply.\n\nB is accurate. 7 will have more drops as it's a lower priority. Although I believe this would only be dropped in times of congestion since the traffic above the guaranteed bandwidth is still forwarded as best effort. \n\nC isnt accurate. Egress max is the most a class can forward. This makes it sound as if guaranteed or not.\n\nD  Nothing is hitting the egress max so this seems irrelevant."

But this is valid only for overlapping configuration\"\n\"You need to be careful, what is actually defined in the template. For example - if you decide to enable HA in the template, but after that you decide to not push it with template and just disable it again (remove the check from the \"Enable HA\" checkbox). This still will be part of the template, because now your template is explicitely defining HA disabled. If you made a change in the template, and later decide that you don't want to control this setting with template, you need to revert the config by clicking the green bar next to the changed value\""

It's worth noting that in certain certificates, the Subject Alternate Name extension can be utilized as an alternative means of specifying identity.\nIn this particular context, it appears that the term \"attributes\" is not confined to the conventional attributes of a certificate, but rather refers broadly to its properties. Since there is only one attribute mentioned, SAN, and it's not obligatory, the answer likely consists of attributes that are essential for decrypting the traffic.

Panorama centralizes time-trended performance information (CPU, memory, CPS, and throughput), logging performance, environmental information (such as fans, RAID status, and power supplies) and correlates events\u2014such as commits, content installs, and software upgrades\u2014to health data. When a firewall deviates from its calculated baseline, Panorama reports it as a Deviating Device to help identify, diagnose, and resolve any hardware issues quickly."

The SSL Forward Proxy Decryption policy is configured on the firewall to decrypt the SSL traffic and inspect it for threats. If the firewall fails over, the existing session is transferred to the active firewall, which continues to decrypt the SSL traffic and inspect it for threats. This ensures that there is no disruption in the traffic flow and the security of the network is maintained. Option B is incorrect because dropping the session would result in disruption of the traffic flow and could lead to security issues. Option C is incorrect because sending the session to fastpath would bypass the SSL Forward Proxy Decryption policy, which defeats the purpose of having the policy in place. Option D is incorrect because allowing the session without decrypting it would also defeat the purpose of having the SSL Forward Proxy Decryption policy in place."

Custom Panorama Admin roles require planning and configuration, but they provide extensive flexibility because you can control what administrators can access through the web interface or the CLI.\n\nDevice Group and Template Admin:\nDevice Group and Template Admin roles also require configuration because there are no built-in examples. These Admin Roles allow you to define which Panorama templates or Panorama device groups an administrator can access and configure.

However, some applications\u2014such as VoIP\u2014have NAT intelligence embedded in the client application. In these cases, the SIP ALG on the firewall can interfere with the signaling sessions and cause the client application to stop working.\nOne solution to this problem is to define an Application Override Policy for SIP, but using this approach disables the App-ID and threat detection functionality. A better approach is to disable the SIP ALG, which does not disable App-ID or threat detection."

Also, if you have many address and service objects that are unused, clearing Share Unused Address and Service Objects with Devices REDUCES the commit times significantly ON THE FIREWALLS because the configuration pushed to each firewall is smaller.

With this approach, you can reduce the volume of VoIP traffic by avoiding sudden disconnections and their subsequent connection attempts.\nC: To monitor the bandwidth consumed by VoIP applications (SIP and RTP), you can configure a Quality of Service (QoS) profile and define a class for these applications.\nD: To view the bandwidth consumed by VoIP applications (SIP and RTP), you need to enable QoS on the input interface to be able to see QoS statistics and monitor in real-time the bandwidth used by these applications.

By providing traceability for devices and associating network events with specific devices, Device-ID lets you gain context for how events relate to devices and adds policy rules that are associated with devices, instead of users, locations, or IP addresses, which can change over time. You can use Device-ID in Security, Decryption, Quality of Service (QoS), and Authentication policies."

In some cases, customers build their own custom applications to address specific needs unique to the company. For these applications, we may not have signatures to properly identify the expected behavior and identify the traffic with a known application. In such cases, we recommended creating an application override to allow easier identification and reporting, and to prevent confusion."
