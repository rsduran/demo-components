The major difference between the two is the granularity of visibility and control delivered by the CN-Series. VM-Series firewalls can enforce cluster-level security policies, which makes them good for basic perimeter security of an entire cluster."

The plug-in can monitor the EC2 instances in the VPC, collects the attributes assigned to the EC2 instances, and create IP-to-Tag mappings which can then be used for dynamic address groups.

The determination is made based on either policy or the flow\u2019s inability to be inspected (i.e., encrypted traffic). If the flow is deemed unfit for inspection, it is offloaded to the Smart NIC, saving the need for the firewall to analyze it, which reduces load on the firewall and increases performance."

Protecting this traffic flow is critical as it can prevent external threats from entering the network and block outbound communication to malicious sites.\n\nInbound traffic (C): This includes traffic coming into the network from external sources. By inspecting and securing inbound traffic, zero-day threats can be stopped before they reach internal resources.\n\nEast-west traffic (E): This is the traffic that moves laterally within a data center or network. Protecting east-west traffic helps prevent the spread of threats once they have entered the network, limiting the damage that zero-day attacks can cause within the internal environment."

While inbound traffic is part of north-south flow, it's not the only component.\n* Internal: This inspects traffic within the internal network, useful for malware detection but not specifically zero-day attacks at the entry point.\n* East-west: Similar to internal traffic, this focuses on communication between devices within the network, not necessarily catching external threats.\n\nTherefore, the most relevant option for zero-day protection is \"C\": Inbound\n\nBy inspecting inbound traffic, firewalls can potentially identify and block suspicious activity even if it exploits an unknown vulnerability (zero-day)."
