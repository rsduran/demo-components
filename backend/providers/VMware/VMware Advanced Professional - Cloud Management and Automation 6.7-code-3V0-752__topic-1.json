Which means you can use an instant clone pool in the fashion of  linked clones where the OS may actually never be refreshed. That implies the space-efficient disks may be useful in space reclamation while using instant clones pools.

Even with a suitable GPU decoding H.264, the bandwidth overhead with Blast Extreme is considerably higher compared to that of PCoIP. Finally the Low Storage Space requirement makes me think Instant Clones over Linked Clones. Therefore I agree with examtopics on this one - Answer for me would be: A"

Here is the reason:\nEach vSAN node can have up to 5 disk groups, each one with 1 disk for cache and 7 disks for capacity.\nAs the scenario documents, there's only 1 disk group per host (because there is only one SSD drive in each host). This vSAN is hybrid (SSDs+HDDs). This disk group have 1 200GB SSD disk for cache and 4 500GB HDD disks for capacity. The cache disk must be at least 10% of the total capacity disks (which is the case). \nIf you add 3 200GB SSD disk to each of the hosts, you can have 4 disk groups, each one with 1 200GB SSD disk for cache and 1 500GB for capacity, augmenting considerably the cache, improving the performance and the user experience.\nWe could consider the second alternative (B), adding 1 200GB SSD to each of the hosts. So, we could have 2 disk groups in each host, each disk group with 1 200GB SSD disk and 2 500GB HDD disks. It would be a cheaper solution, but performance would not be as good as the first alternative. It would be a cheaper solution, but performance would not be as good as the first alternative.
