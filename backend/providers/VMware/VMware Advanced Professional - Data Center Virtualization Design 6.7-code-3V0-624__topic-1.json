However, we don't know how many VMs are required, therefore there's a risk of a high CPU overcommitment (especially in case of failover), which will impact on performance. Also, if the application doesn't need/use 8 cores, their use will be scheduled anyway therefore wasting resources (we don't know that, but if 1 vCPU is enough for the application then it would be counterproductive to configure it with 8)\nB) It'd be good practice to start a VM with lower vCPU possible and then increase if needed. This solution lower the risk of over-commitment, and guest clustering is supported for HA. This provides both guest and hardware failover. Might or might not have lower performance, requirements of the application (and host network/storage specifications) are not mentioned.\nC) No, FT supports up to 4 vCPU\nd) No, FT doesn't support OS (Microsoft at least) failover clustering: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-651-setup-mscs.pdf p.13\n\nA bit tricky not knowing more details about application and OS, but I'd say B (assuming HW supports it), as it provides failover for both OS and HW failures and won't cause high CPU overcommitment (hence answering all 3 questions)."

While in vSphere 6.5 U1 and 6.7 it supports up to 8vCPU per VM, but the same 8vCPU protected on a host and the same 4 VMs protected. It makes no sense to have an OS cluster that offers high availability and spend twice as many resources to protect them with FT in a 3 ESXi cluster with 8 cores. Since it is enough to protect them with HA.\nConsidering that the statement says the highest level of Uptime and Individual Performance then this covers it with FT and 8vCPU per VM. This way you could protect: A single VM per host (in vSphere 6.5U1 or higher) located on host1, the secondary copy would be on the other host2 and host3 would remain for high availability. For this reason, the answer is C (Assuming that VCAP 6.5 also takes into account the maximum values \u200b\u200bof 6.5 U1).\nIf, on the other hand, it only takes into account only the maximum values \u200b\u200bof vSphere 6.5 U1 then the Answer would be D, since it could NOT protect 8vCPU (but if 4 VM of 1 vCPU), and the highest level of Uptime would achieve it with OS Level cluster and FT."

The word \"Must\" usually refers to requirements.\n\"Application must be kept online during planned migration\" is a non-functional requirements, defining how the system should behave during migration. This reduces the design options, therefore it's a constraint. \n\"Application must be restarted quickly\" is a functional requirement. It establish that what the system should do (restart apps quickly), without introducing design boundaries"
