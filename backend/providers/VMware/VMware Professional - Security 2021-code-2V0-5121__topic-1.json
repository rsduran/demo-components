Global Entitlements are automatically synchronized so there is no need to synchronize pools manually. You initialize CPA at one site, then from the other site join the CPA federation. Next create Global Entitlements and add local pools from each site to the Global Entitlement. You do have to be connected to the Connection Server where the local pools exist in order to add to the Global Entitlement.\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2206/horizon-cloud-pod-architecture/GUID-AE1B4398-B275-40C7-AF45-A727E359E5DF.html"
