Micro-segmentation divides the network into smaller segments to enhance security. Distributed Intrusion Detection helps gain insights into these segmented traffic flows, ensuring that communication between different segments is secure and free from intrusions.\n\nD. Use agentless antivirus with Guest introspection:\nDistributed Intrusion Detection on NSX allows for agentless antivirus solutions through Guest Introspection. This means antivirus scanning can be done without installing any additional agents on individual virtual machines. Distributed Intrusion Detection helps in detecting any malicious activity or threats within these virtual machines, providing security without compromising performance."

A range of VLANs can also be specified (VLAN X-Y).\nUplink trunk segments specify which VLANs are allowed but do not add 802.1Q VLAN tagging. Tags are added in the uplink interface of VRF gateways.\nYou can configure a dedicated uplink trunk segment for each VRF uplink if the trunk is configured as a single VLAN range (X-X). As a best practice, you should connect the VRF uplinks to the same uplink trunk segment. This method reduces the number of resources required (segments, logical switch ports, and logical router ports)."
