    "body": "Refer to the ACME Financials design use case.<br><br>ACME Financials Design Use Case -<br>1. Introduction<br>1.1 Business Overview<br>ACME Financials is an investment firm that has established itself as a leader in USA's fast-moving financial asset management market and has around 1000 employees.<br>ACME plans to transform its end-user computing resources to the digital workspace. ACME wants a secure platform that is available from any device and from anywhere, as well as a solution that reduces operating costs.<br>ACME's major business driver for the digital workplace is to enable employees to work remotely, and to enable the secure access to all of its resources from anywhere and any device while enhancing security with multi-factor authentication. The solution should support its BYOD strategy and let remote employees use their own laptop, desktop, or mobile device to access the resources from any location.<br>ACME also wants to remove the need to supply and manage desktop hardware to external contractors. Because financial data is highly sensitive, the firm needs a technology that would protect customer and other critical information - even when accessed on a mobile device. ACME is looking to improve the security of the desktop and application platforms across the enterprise. In addition to using endpoint security tools and multi-factor authentication, ACME insists on using additional security and controls to provide the highest level of security and protection to services and applications.<br>ACME currently uses a VPN-based remote access solution. ACME would like to remove additional components that add support or management complexity, and device dependence for remote access users. ACME is looking to achieve the same access to virtual desktops and Windows 10 or mobile applications, both inside and outside of the ACME enterprise network.<br>ACME is very keen on enforcing standardization to keep the IT infrastructure as consistent as possible. IT wants to use standardized versions of Windows<br>(Windows 10), consistent configurations, and application delivery from a central source. All while maintaining the compliance of every device that requires encryption, password and PIN protection, as well as update -and anti-virus control.<br>To simplify and standardize desktop and application delivery, ACME wants to offer a service catalog based approach based on ACME IT standards. This will allow<br>ACME to effectively deliver and manage resources, allowing IT to deliver device and application services that meet business and technical needs, while maximizing the use of shared IT computing resources.<br><br>Additional Facts -<br>\u2711 Speaking to the developers revealed that most apps are standardized apps from public app-stores, but ACME uses some their in-house developed, critical mobile apps, where some of the developers have already left the company, so that they cannot be rewritten in a short amount of time.<br>\u2711 To reduce operating costs, ACME has already moved to Office 365 and is currently running a few migrations from on-premises to the cloud for other applications.<br>\u2711 ACME's IT says that it is a Microsoft Windows only shop, but the assessment shows that currently most of the managers are using Apple devices.<br>\u2711 ACME currently uses directory services and two-factor authentication mechanisms (Radius) for internal and external access. ACME requires to support Single<br>Sign-On (SSO) integration with their current authentication solutions. They also require to use SSO whenever possible, as they do not believe in having multiple user accounts and passwords for their end users.<br>\u2711 ACME wants the solution to provide mechanisms to provide a secure e-mail solution to any device that complies to global security standards even for BYO devices.<br>1.2 High Level User Classification<br>\u2711 680 Office workers (call center, corporate and office administrators) use standardized PCs or Thin-Clients to access ACMEs core apps and tools.<br>\u2711 240 Remote-office workers use the company's CYOD initiative and use these devices (Notebooks, Convertibles, Tablets, Android phones) to access their apps and tools from remote.<br>\u2711 30 Executives use Apple Mac Books as well as iPhones and iPads to work on- and off-premises.<br>\u2711 80 IT -admins and software developers are using high-end workstations with administrative access.<br>1.3 High Level Application Assessment<br>\u2711 ACME currently has 261 applications, of which 186 are based on Microsoft Windows.<br>\u2711 Today, users are allocated applications via AD group membership.<br>\u2711 75 applications are either web-based or SaaS-based, including Office 365.<br>\u2711 A major incident recently meant sales workers were disappearing suddenly along with their data and laptops on some new colonies.<br>\u2711 Any external access should require multi-factor authentication. Access from the internal network should work seamlessly with SSO for the core applications.<br>High-security applications also require MFA from internal access.<br>\u2711 The address ranges of the HQ datacenter are as follows:<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 172.16.0.0/16 internal<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 80.34.57.20/21 external<br>2. Initial Stakeholder Interview Findings<br>In addition to the goals summarized in the previous section, the following are findings from initial interviews with the key stakeholders and an analysis of their service level agreements.<br>1. The design must use the F5 Loadbalancer and should be as redundant as possible.<br>2. Qualified IT personal is hard to find these days. If possible, reduce operational costs and try to automate or outsource basic IT-tasks.<br>3. ACME is very particular about meeting the go-live date. If there are unforeseen delays, the project may not be delivered for the required go-live date.<br>Which three are physical design requirements in the Workspace ONE UEM design for ACME (Choose three.)<br>",

    "body": "Refer to the ACME Financials design use case.<br><br>ACME Financials Design Use Case -<br>1. Introduction<br>1.1 Business Overview<br>ACME Financials is an investment firm that has established itself as a leader in USA's fast-moving financial asset management market and has around 1000 employees.<br>ACME plans to transform its end-user computing resources to the digital workspace. ACME wants a secure platform that is available from any device and from anywhere, as well as a solution that reduces operating costs.<br>ACME's major business driver for the digital workplace is to enable employees to work remotely, and to enable the secure access to all of its resources from anywhere and any device while enhancing security with multi-factor authentication. The solution should support its BYOD strategy and let remote employees use their own laptop, desktop, or mobile device to access the resources from any location.<br>ACME also wants to remove the need to supply and manage desktop hardware to external contractors. Because financial data is highly sensitive, the firm needs a technology that would protect customer and other critical information - even when accessed on a mobile device. ACME is looking to improve the security of the desktop and application platforms across the enterprise. In addition to using endpoint security tools and multi-factor authentication, ACME insists on using additional security and controls to provide the highest level of security and protection to services and applications.<br>ACME currently uses a VPN-based remote access solution. ACME would like to remove additional components that add support or management complexity, and device dependence for remote access users. ACME is looking to achieve the same access to virtual desktops and Windows 10 or mobile applications, both inside and outside of the ACME enterprise network.<br>ACME is very keen on enforcing standardization to keep the IT infrastructure as consistent as possible. IT wants to use standardized versions of Windows<br>(Windows 10), consistent configurations, and application delivery from a central source. All while maintaining the compliance of every device that requires encryption, password and PIN protection, as well as update -and anti-virus control.<br>To simplify and standardize desktop and application delivery, ACME wants to offer a service catalog based approach based on ACME IT standards. This will allow<br>ACME to effectively deliver and manage resources, allowing IT to deliver device and application services that meet business and technical needs, while maximizing the use of shared IT computing resources.<br><br>Additional Facts -<br>\u2711 Speaking to the developers revealed that most apps are standardized apps from public app-stores, but ACME uses some their in-house developed, critical mobile apps, where some of the developers have already left the company, so that they cannot be rewritten in a short amount of time.<br>\u2711 To reduce operating costs, ACME has already moved to Office 365 and is currently running a few migrations from on-premises to the cloud for other applications.<br>ACME's IT says that it is a Microsoft Windows only shop, but the assessment shows that currently most of the managers are using Apple devices.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03407/0001200003.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>\u2711 ACME currently uses directory services and two-factor authentication mechanisms (Radius) for internal and external access. ACME requires to support Single<br>Sign-On (SSO) integration with their current authentication solutions. They also require to use SSO whenever possible, as they do not believe in having multiple user accounts and passwords for their end users.<br>\u2711 ACME wants the solution to provide mechanisms to provide a secure e-mail solution to any device that complies to global security standards even for BYO devices.<br>1.2 High Level User Classification<br>\u2711 680 Office workers (call center, corporate and office administrators) use standardized PCs or Thin-Clients to access ACME's core apps and tools.<br>\u2711 240 Remote-office workers use the company's CYOD initiative and use these devices (Notebooks, Convertibles, Tablets, Android phones) to access their apps and tools from remote.<br>\u2711 30 Executives use Apple Mac Books as well as iPhones and iPads to work on- and off-premises.<br>\u2711 80 IT -admins and software developers are using high-end workstations with administrative access.<br>1.3 High Level Application Assessment<br>\u2711 ACME currently has 261 applications, of which 186 are based on Microsoft Windows.<br>\u2711 Today, users are allocated applications via AD group membership.<br>\u2711 75 applications are either web-based or SaaS-based, including Office 365.<br>\u2711 A major incident recently meant sales workers were disappearing suddenly along with their data and laptops on some new colonies.<br>\u2711 Any external access should require multi-factor authentication. Access from the internal network should work seamlessly with SSO for the core applications.<br>High-security applications also require MFA from internal access.<br>\u2711 The address ranges of the HQ datacenter are as follows:<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 172.16.0.0/16 internal<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 80.34.57.20/21 external<br>2. Initial Stakeholder Interview Findings<br>In addition to the goals summarized in the previous section, the following are findings from initial interviews with the key stakeholders and an analysis of their service level agreements.<br>1. The design must use the F5 Loadbalancer and should be as redundant as possible.<br>2. Qualified IT personal is hard to find these days. If possible, reduce operational costs and try to automate or outsource basic IT-tasks.<br>3. ACME is very particular about meeting the go-live date. If there are unforeseen delays, the project may not be delivered for the required go-live date.<br>ACME requires multi-factor authentication for application access from external networks. This has been established with a default access policy that incorporates multi-factor authentication. However, some users complain that they do not want to enter the multi-factor authentication when accessing the applications from within the company network.<br>How can the user experience be improved?<br>",

    "body": "Refer to the ACME Financials design use case.<br><br>ACME Financials Design Use Case -<br>1. Introduction<br>1.1 Business Overview<br>ACME Financials is an investment firm that has established itself as a leader in USA's fast-moving financial asset management market and has around 1000 employees.<br>ACME plans to transform its end-user computing resources to the digital workspace. ACME wants a secure platform that is available from any device and from anywhere, as well as a solution that reduces operating costs.<br>ACME's major business driver for the digital workplace is to enable employees to work remotely, and to enable the secure access to all of its resources from anywhere and any device while enhancing security with multi-factor authentication. The solution should support its BYOD strategy and let remote employees use their own laptop, desktop, or mobile device to access the resources from any location.<br>ACME also wants to remove the need to supply and manage desktop hardware to external contractors. Because financial data is highly sensitive, the firm needs a technology that would protect customer and other critical information - even when accessed on a mobile device. ACME is looking to improve the security of the desktop and application platforms across the enterprise. In addition to using endpoint security tools and multi-factor authentication, ACME insists on using additional security and controls to provide the highest level of security and protection to services and applications.<br>ACME currently uses a VPN-based remote access solution. ACME would like to remove additional components that add support or management complexity, and device dependence for remote access users. ACME is looking to achieve the same access to virtual desktops and Windows 10 or mobile applications, both inside and outside of the ACME enterprise network.<br>ACME is very keen on enforcing standardization to keep the IT infrastructure as consistent as possible. IT wants to use standardized versions of Windows<br>(Windows 10), consistent configurations, and application delivery from a central source. All while maintaining the compliance of every device that requires encryption, password and PIN protection, as well as update -and anti-virus control.<br>To simplify and standardize desktop and application delivery, ACME wants to offer a service catalog based approach based on ACME IT standards. This will allow<br>ACME to effectively deliver and manage resources, allowing IT to deliver device and application services that meet business and technical needs, while maximizing the use of shared IT computing resources.<br><br>Additional Facts -<br>\u2711 Speaking to the developers revealed that most apps are standardized apps from public app-stores, but ACME uses some their in-house developed, critical mobile apps, where some of the developers have already left the company, so that they cannot be rewritten in a short amount of time.<br>\u2711 To reduce operating costs, ACME has already moved to Office 365 and is currently running a few migrations from on-premises to the cloud for other applications.<br>\u2711 ACME's IT says that it is a Microsoft Windows only shop, but the assessment shows that currently most of the managers are using Apple devices.<br>\u2711 ACME currently uses directory services and two-factor authentication mechanisms (Radius) for internal and external access. ACME requires to support Single<br>Sign-On (SSO) integration with their current authentication solutions. They also require to use SSO whenever possible, as they do not believe in having multiple user accounts and passwords for their end users.<br>\u2711 ACME wants the solution to provide mechanisms to provide a secure e-mail solution to any device that complies to global security standards even for BYO devices.<br>1.2 High Level User Classification<br>\u2711 680 Office workers (call center, corporate and office administrators) use standardized PCs or Thin-Clients to access ACME's core apps and tools.<br>\u2711 240 Remote-office workers use the company's CYOD initiative and use these devices (Notebooks, Convertibles, Tablets, Android phones) to access their apps and tools from remote.<br>\u2711 30 Executives use Apple Mac Books as well as iPhones and iPads to work on- and off-premises.<br>\u2711 80 IT -admins and software developers are using high-end workstations with administrative access.<br>1.3 High Level Application Assessment<br>ACME currently has 261 applications, of which 186 are based on Microsoft Windows.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03407/0003500010.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>\u2711 Today, users are allocated applications via AD group membership.<br>\u2711 75 applications are either web-based or SaaS-based, including Office 365.<br>\u2711 A major incident recently meant sales workers were disappearing suddenly along with their data and laptops on some new colonies.<br>\u2711 Any external access should require multi-factor authentication. Access from the internal network should work seamlessly with SSO for the core applications.<br>High-security applications also require MFA from internal access.<br>\u2711 The address ranges of the HQ datacenter are as follows:<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 172.16.0.0/16 internal<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 80.34.57.20/21 external<br>2. Initial Stakeholder Interview Findings<br>In addition to the goals summarized in the previous section, the following are findings from initial interviews with the key stakeholders and an analysis of their service level agreements.<br>1. The design must use the F5 Loadbalancer and should be as redundant as possible.<br>2. Qualified IT personal is hard to find these days. If possible, reduce operational costs and try to automate or outsource basic IT-tasks.<br>3. ACME is very particular about meeting the go-live date. If there are unforeseen delays, the project may not be delivered for the required go-live date.<br>There is a requirement of having F5 as a primary load balancer.<br>Which two components are part of the logical design behind the load balancer? (Choose two.)<br>",

Introduction<br>1.1 Business Overview<br>ACME Financials is an investment firm that has established itself as a leader in USA's fast-moving financial asset management market and has around 1000 employees.<br>ACME plans to transform its end-user computing resources to the digital workspace. ACME wants a secure platform that is available from any device and from anywhere, as well as a solution that reduces operating costs.<br>ACME's major business driver for the digital workplace is to enable employees to work remotely, and to enable the secure access to all of its resources from anywhere and any device while enhancing security with multi-factor authentication. The solution should support its BYOD strategy and let remote employees use their own laptop, desktop, or mobile device to access the resources from any location.<br>ACME also wants to remove the need to supply and manage desktop hardware to external contractors. Because financial data is highly sensitive, the firm needs a technology that would protect customer and other critical information - even when accessed on a mobile device. ACME is looking to improve the security of the desktop and application platforms across the enterprise. In addition to using endpoint security tools and multi-factor authentication, ACME insists on using additional security and controls to provide the highest level of security and protection to services and applications.<br>ACME currently uses a VPN-based remote access solution. ACME would like to remove additional components that add support or management complexity, and device dependence for remote access users. ACME is looking to achieve the same access to virtual desktops and Windows 10 or mobile applications, both inside and outside of the ACME enterprise network.<br>ACME is very keen on enforcing standardization to keep the IT infrastructure as consistent as possible. IT wants to use standardized versions of Windows<br>(Windows 10), consistent configurations, and application delivery from a central source. All while maintaining the compliance of every device that requires encryption, password and PIN protection, as well as update -and anti-virus control.<br>To simplify and standardize desktop and application delivery, ACME wants to offer a service catalog based approach based on ACME IT standards. This will allow<br>ACME to effectively deliver and manage resources, allowing IT to deliver device and application services that meet business and technical needs, while maximizing the use of shared IT computing resources.<br><br>Additional Facts -<br>\u2711 Speaking to the developers revealed that most apps are standardized apps from public app-stores, but ACME uses some their in-house developed, critical mobile apps, where some of the developers have already left the company, so that they cannot be rewritten in a short amount of time.<br>\u2711 To reduce operating costs, ACME has already moved to Office 365 and is currently running a few migrations from on-premises to the cloud for other applications.<br>\u2711 ACME's IT says that it is a Microsoft Windows only shop, but the assessment shows that currently most of the managers are using Apple devices.<br>\u2711 ACME currently uses directory services and two-factor authentication mechanisms (Radius) for internal and external access. ACME requires to support Single<br>Sign-On (SSO) integration with their current authentication solutions. They also require to use SSO whenever possible, as they do not believe in having multiple user accounts and passwords for their end users.<br>\u2711 ACME wants the solution to provide mechanisms to provide a secure e-mail solution to any device that complies to global security standards even for BYO devices.<br>1.2 High Level User Classification<br>\u2711 680 Office workers (call center, corporate and office administrators) use standardized PCs or Thin-Clients to access ACME's core apps and tools.<br>\u2711 240 Remote-office workers use the company's CYOD initiative and use these devices (Notebooks, Convertibles, Tablets, Android phones) to access their apps and tools from remote.<br>\u2711 30 Executives use Apple Mac Books as well as iPhones and iPads to work on- and off-premises.<br>\u2711 80 IT -admins and software developers are using high-end workstations with administrative access.<br>1.3 High Level Application Assessment<br>\u2711 ACME currently has 261 applications, of which 186 are based on Microsoft Windows.<br>\u2711 Today, users are allocated applications via AD group membership.<br>\u2711 75 applications are either web-based or SaaS-based, including Office 365.<br>\u2711 A major incident recently meant sales workers were disappearing suddenly along with their data and laptops on some new colonies.<br>\u2711 Any external access should require multi-factor authentication. Access from the internal network should work seamlessly with SSO for the core applications.<br>High-security applications also require MFA from internal access.<br>\u2711 The address ranges of the HQ datacenter are as follows:<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 172.16.0.0/16 internal<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 80.34.57.20/21 external<br>2. Initial Stakeholder Interview Findings<br>In addition to the goals summarized in the previous section, the following are findings from initial interviews with the key stakeholders and an analysis of their service level agreements.<br>1. The design must use the F5 Loadbalancer and should be as redundant as possible.<br>2. Qualified IT personal is hard to find these days. If possible, reduce operational costs and try to automate or outsource basic IT-tasks.<br>3. ACME is very particular about meeting the go-live date. If there are unforeseen delays, the project may not be delivered for the required go-live date.<br>After the successful deployment of Workspace ONE, ACME plans to move their virtual desktop infrastructure to Horizon on AWS. But there are still Web apps and file services which will run in the on-premises datacenter.<br>Which two components are still needed in the on-premises datacenter? (Choose two.)<br>",

They also require to use SSO whenever possible, as they do not believe in having multiple user accounts and passwords for their end users.<br>\u2711 ACME wants the solution to provide mechanisms to provide a secure e-mail solution to any device that complies to global security standards even for BYO devices.<br>1.2 High Level User Classification<br>\u2711 680 Office workers (call center, corporate and office administrators) use standardized PCs or Thin-Clients to access ACME's core apps and tools.<br>\u2711 240 Remote-office workers use the company's CYOD initiative and use these devices (Notebooks, Convertibles, Tablets, Android phones) to access their apps and tools from remote.<br>\u2711 30 Executives use Apple Mac Books as well as iPhones and iPads to work on- and off-premises.<br>\u2711 80 IT -admins and software developers are using high-end workstations with administrative access.<br>1.3 High Level Application Assessment<br>\u2711 ACME currently has 261 applications, of which 186 are based on Microsoft Windows.<br>\u2711 Today, users are allocated applications via AD group membership.<br>\u2711 75 applications are either web-based or SaaS-based, including Office 365.<br>\u2711 A major incident recently meant sales workers were disappearing suddenly along with their data and laptops on some new colonies.<br>\u2711 Any external access should require multi-factor authentication. Access from the internal network should work seamlessly with SSO for the core applications.<br>High-security applications also require MFA from internal access.<br>\u2711 The address ranges of the HQ datacenter are as follows:<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 172.16.0.0/16 internal<br>\u00e2\u2014\u00a6 80.34.57.20/21 external<br>2. Initial Stakeholder Interview Findings<br>In addition to the goals summarized in the previous section, the following are findings from initial interviews with the key stakeholders and an analysis of their service level agreements.<br>1. The design must use the F5 Loadbalancer and should be as redundant as possible.<br>2. Qualified IT personal is hard to find these days. If possible, reduce operational costs and try to automate or outsource basic IT-tasks.<br>3. ACME is very particular about meeting the go-live date. If there are unforeseen delays, the project may not be delivered for the required go-live date.<br>What are three required components in the logical design? (Choose three.)<br>",
