In vSAN, virtual machine components are stored as a set of objects, and each object represents a specific part of a virtual machine, such as VMDK files, VM configuration files, and snapshots.\n\nD. vSphere Virtual Volumes (vVols): vVols is a storage virtualization technology that allows vSphere to manage storage at the VM level granularity. With vVols, VMs are stored as individual objects on the storage system, and each VM has its own set of objects, including VMDK files, configuration files, and snapshots. vVols enables policy-based management of VM storage at the individual VM level."

Create a cold clone of the physical server using VMware vCenter Converter.\nExplanation:\nCold cloning involves shutting down the physical server and creating an image of the system, including the operating system and application, while the server is offline. This ensures that there are no changes to the application or data during the cloning process, which aligns with the fact that the business owner is not concerned about capturing every transaction.\n\nSince the secure location has no network connectivity, cold cloning is preferable because you can create the image offline and transport it physically to the remote location."

When converting Windows sources, you can set Converter Standalone to synchronize the destination virtual machine with the source machine after hot cloning. Synchronization is performed by transferring from the source to the destination the blocks that were changed during the initial cloning period. To avoid loss of data on the destination virtual machine, Converter Standalone can shut down certain Windows services before the synchronization. Based on your settings, Converter Standalone shuts down the selected Windows services so that no critical changes occur on the source machine while destination is being synchronized.\n\nWith Standalone Converter 6.4 exists no Cold Cloning anymore.\n\nReference:\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/vCenter-Converter-Standalone/6.4/vcenter-converter/GUID-105598AA-F443-4339-AC6D-E7664C1A9B4F.html"

All other elements are optional.\nVendor add-on\nThe vendor add-on is a collection of software components that OEMs create and distribute. The vendor add-on can contain drivers, patches, and solutions.\nFirmware and drivers add-on\nThe firmware and drivers add-on is a special type of vendor add-on designed to assist in the firmware update process. The firmware and drivers add-on contains firmware for a specific server type and corresponding drivers. To add a firmware and drivers add-on to your image, you must install the hardware support manager plug-in provided by the hardware vendor for the hosts in the respective cluster.\nIndependent components\nThe component is the smallest discrete unit in an image.

ESXi base image: This is the core operating system for ESXi hosts and is a fundamental part of any vSphere Lifecycle Manager image.\n\nD. Vendor add-ons: Vendor-specific software or components can be included in the image to add functionality that is specific to certain hardware platforms (e.g., drivers or management tools provided by hardware vendors).\n\nF. Firmware and drivers add-on: vLCM allows you to manage and update host firmware and drivers along with the ESXi base image to ensure hardware compatibility and stability.\n\nG.

You must also deploy an OEM-provided hardware support manager and register it as a vCenter Server extension. The hardware support manager inspects the hardware of the hosts in the cluster and lists available and compatible firmware versions, which you can add to the image for the cluster. The actual firmware update happens upon remediating the cluster against an image that contains a firmware add-on.\"\n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-lifecycle-manager/GUID-6906DCFA-F4A4-4A67-A86D-2F56AB0B3B38.html"

You would therefore set the restart priority for the database server to 1, the application server to 2, and the Web server to 3.\n\nThis would ensure that the database server is restarted first, followed by the application server, and then the Web server.

When the VM's power back on, they are then only aware of the EVC CPU feature set enabled which will allow the VM's to live migrate to the older hardware.\n\nTo Simplify.\n1.

This means that SIOC will not be triggered unless the datastore latency exceeds 30 ms.\n\nThe three virtual machines are assigned the following shares:\n\nGold tier VM: 10 shares\nSilver tier VM: 5 shares\nBronze tier VM: 2 shares\nThe maximum number of IOPS that the bronze tier VM is entitled to is 10,000 IOPS.

The vertical timeline view provides you with detailed information about the different VM template versions, the updates that privileged users have made, and when the last change was made. By using the vertical timeline, you can revert VM templates back to their previous state or delete the previous version of a VM template.\n\nIn addition, you can deploy a virtual machine from the latest version of the VM template without any disruptions while it is checked out for update.
