If your ingress subnet is too small, you limit the number of ingress and load balancer services that you can deploy in the cluster. If your egress subnet is too small, you limit the number of segments or namespaces that you can deploy.\n\nFrom VMware Cloud Foundation: Deploy, Configure, Manage [V5.0]"
