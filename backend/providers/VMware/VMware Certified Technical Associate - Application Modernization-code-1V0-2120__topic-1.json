Folder is the optional selection when deploying a new virtual machine in the vSphere Client.\nHere's a breakdown of why the others are mandatory:\n * Data center: This is the top-level container for all objects in vSphere. A virtual machine must belong to a data center.\n * Compute resource: This can be a host, cluster, or resource pool. It specifies where the virtual machine will run.\n * Guest OS: You need to select the operating system that will be installed on the virtual machine.\nWhile a folder is useful for organizing virtual machines, it's not strictly required for deployment. You can deploy a virtual machine directly in a data center, compute resource, or even at the root level if desired.\nTherefore, folder is the optional selection."

It balances resources such as CPU, memory, and storage I/O across the cluster in real-time, ensuring that no single host becomes overutilized while others remain underutilized.\n\nBy using vSphere DRS, administrators can improve the performance and utilization of their vSphere environment, while also providing a more stable and predictable infrastructure. Additionally, vSphere DRS can help reduce the risk of downtime by automatically migrating virtual machines to other hosts in the event of a host failure."

Unlike traditional storage solutions like NFS (A Network File System) or VMFS (Virtual Machine File System), vVols enables more efficient and streamlined storage management for virtual machines."

It's important to note that snapshots should be used cautiously and should not be kept for an extended period to avoid potential issues with snapshot size and performance impact on the VM."

Install a Type-2 hypervisor accomplishes this goal.\n\nA virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a computer system, which allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. In order to deploy virtual machines on a Windows 10 desktop, you need to install a hypervisor, which is a piece of software that creates and manages virtual machines.\n\nThere are two main types of hypervisors: Type-1 and Type-2. A Type-1 hypervisor runs directly on the host machine's hardware, and provides a virtualized environment for guest operating systems. A Type-2 hypervisor, on the other hand, runs as a software application on an existing operating system, and provides a virtualized environment for guest operating systems.\n\nTo deploy virtual machines on a Windows 10 desktop, you would need to install a Type-2 hypervisor, such as VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, or Hyper-V.\n\nAdding an additional CD-ROM, installing Windows patches, and adding an additional network interface are not relevant to deploying virtual machines on a Windows 10 desktop."

Use a Windows 10 customization specification when deploying the virtual machines.\n\nUsing a customization specification allows for the automation of post-deployment configurations, such as assigning unique computer names to the VMs. When deploying the VMs from the Win10-Template, the operator can specify a customization specification that includes settings for unique computer names for each VM. This way, each VM created from the template will be configured with its own distinct computer name based on the settings provided in the customization specification."

The burst size defines how much data is considered a large amount."

Traffic shaping\nExplanation: Traffic shaping is a feature of vSphere Distributed Switch that allows an administrator to restrict the network bandwidth that is available to ports. This feature also allows for bursts of traffic to flow through at higher speeds, which is the requirement specified by the administrator. Traffic shaping helps to regulate the flow of network traffic by specifying a maximum and minimum bandwidth limit for each port, which in turn helps to ensure that sufficient bandwidth is available for critical network traffic and prevent network congestion."
