Remove the host from the cluster, replace the faulty disks, re-add the host to the cluster.\n\nHere's why this is the recommended approach:\n\nRemoving the host from the cluster: This isolates the problematic host, ensuring that it doesn't contribute to any further issues or data corruption in the cluster.\n\nReplacing the faulty disks: After removing the host, replace the degraded or faulty storage devices to ensure that you have healthy, functioning hardware.\n\nRe-adding the host to the cluster: Once the disks are replaced and the host is back online, you can re-add it to the vSAN cluster. This allows the cluster to rebuild and resynchronize the data across the new devices and restore redundancy.\n\nThis approach minimizes the risk of data loss or corruption and ensures that you have a healthy vSAN cluster with the least disruption."

New VMDKs have been added to multiple VMs, but the storage policy has not finished applying.\n\nThe \"Healthy Components\" column shows that the number of components in a fully healthy state is less than the total number of components, which suggests that some components are not fully healthy. When new VMDKs are added to VMs, it can trigger the reconfiguration of storage components to meet the requirements of the storage policy. During this reconfiguration process, some components may temporarily not be in a fully healthy state until the reconfiguration completes. This is a common behavior in vSAN when changes are made to VMs or storage policies."
