Looking at the VMware vSphere Install, Configure, Manage V7 Lecture Manual, page 335, it mentions changes are \"merged\" with the base VMDK. Then the next page, it mentions snap data is \"committed\" to the parent (base disk). For every page until 339, it continuously mentioned \"committing\" delta disks to the base disks. I found other documentation link on VMware's site also mentioning committing to base disk.\n\nAs those who support answer B point out, the high writes as described in the question will result in a long stun time. Considering that \"commit\" and \"merge\" mean the same thing, and unless you have super fast storage, you will end up with a long stun time, answer B seems like the correct answer."

Briefly, an ESXi host generates a DEK to encrypt virtual machines and disks. The KEK is provided by a key server, and encrypts (or \"wraps\") the DEK. The KEK is encrypted using the AES256 algorithm and the DEK is encrypted using the XTS-AES-256 algorithm.

No. SIOC doesn't impact standard vMotion\nC. Yes. The faster the link, the faster the migration.\nD. No. LACP is only available on dVS, which are not mentioned.

This instant provisioning is made possible by sharing both the memory and disk state of the SourceVM. From a memory standpoint, all Instant Clones will share the same physical memory pages as its SourceVM. This is true even if Transparent Memory Sharing (TPS) is disabled, which is actually really cool (more details will be updated in KB 2080735 for those interested). In other words, TPS is just one of the techniques that Instant Clone can take advantage of but not solely rely on to help deliver maximum memory efficiencies which ultimately enables greater consolidation ratios."

        "content": "D is correct answer.\nWhen an instant clone is created in vSphere, the memory allocation is handled in a unique way that differs from traditional cloning methods. Rather than creating a new copy of the virtual machine's memory, vSphere leverages a feature called Memory COW (Copy-On-Write) technology to allow multiple virtual machines to share the same memory space.\n\nDuring the instant clone process, a new virtual machine is created with a snapshot of the parent virtual machine's disk state. However, instead of creating a new copy of the virtual machine's memory, the new virtual machine is linked to the parent virtual machine's memory space, which is marked as read-only.\n\nAs the new virtual machine runs, any writes to memory are redirected to a new memory page, which is then marked as read-write and is unique to that virtual machine. This means that multiple virtual machines can share the same memory space without interfering with each other.\n\nThis Memory COW technology allows for faster creation of virtual machines and reduced memory usage, as only the memory pages that have been modified need to be stored separately for each virtual machine."

This enables the VM to capture and analyze all network packets flowing through the virtual switch."

Configure Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) on the cluster.\n\nExplanation:\nEnhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) is a VMware vSphere feature that ensures compatibility between CPU feature sets of hosts in a cluster, allowing virtual machines to be vMotioned seamlessly without any CPU-related compatibility issues.\n\nWhen EVC is enabled on a cluster, vSphere will automatically mask the advanced CPU features of the host CPUs to a common baseline supported by all hosts in the cluster. This provides a uniform CPU feature set for all hosts, allowing vMotion operations to take place without encountering CPU incompatibility issues, like the one mentioned in the error log message.\n\nTo resolve the error, the administrator should enable EVC on the cluster that includes both the source and destination hosts involved in the vMotion process. This will ensure that the virtual machine can be migrated without any CPU compatibility problems, even if the hosts have different underlying CPU architectures or feature sets."

Thin-provisioned\n\nTo mitigate datastore capacity issues without expanding the datastore, the administrator should use the vSphere Storage vMotion migration option called \"Thin-provisioned.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThin-provisioned: When using thin-provisioned storage vMotion, the virtual machine's disk is migrated to the destination datastore, but it only consumes the actual used space on the source datastore. It does not reserve the entire provisioned size of the virtual disk on the destination datastore. This migration option helps to conserve storage space on the destination datastore and is suitable for scenarios where the actual data usage is significantly smaller than the provisioned disk size."

When a snapshot is deleted, any additional files in the hierarchy that are not identified by the Snapshot Manager are included in the commit process.\nSometimes, if the VMs show consolidation is needed and no snapshots are present under the snapshot manager, creating a new snapshot and deleting it clears the entire hierarchy. This means that all snapshot files on the virtual machine are committed, then deleted."
