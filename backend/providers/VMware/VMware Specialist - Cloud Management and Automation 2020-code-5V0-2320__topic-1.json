Create a storage policy containing the tagged datastores, and apply it to the vSphere Namespace\n\nIt could be D, but the question asks to apply it at a Namespace level.\nAfter creating storage policies, a vSphere administrator can perform the following tasks:\nAssign the storage policies to the vSphere Namespace. Storage policies visible to the namespace determine which datastores the namespace can access and use for persistent volumes. The storage policies appear as matching Kubernetes storage classes in the namespace. They are also propagated to the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster on this namespace.

First Class Disk\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.storage.doc/GUID-AD5AE35E-5209-4775-988C-F86D0E4F0C29.html\n\nFirst Class Disk (FCD)\nAlso called Improved Virtual Disk (IVD) or managed virtual disk. It is a named virtual disk unassociated with a VM. These disks reside on a vSAN, VMFS, NFS, or vVols datastore and back ReadWriteOnce container volumes.\nThe FCD technology allows to perform life cycle operations related to persistent volumes outside of the VM or pod life cycle. If the VM is a Kubernetes node that runs multiple container based applications and uses persistent volumes and virtual disks for many applications, CNS facilitates life cycle operations at the container and persistent volume granularity."

Create a VSphere Cluster (add hosts, enable HA and DRS)\n2. Choose and configure the network stack (NSX or VSphere).  (Nowhere in this step does it tell you to determine management uplinks!!

It's not deployed using a YAML file.  Wrong answer.\n\n\nB. It aggregates hosts across vSphere clusters to form a Kubernetes cluster on vSphere. - I thought that would be the answer, but a Supervisor Cluster in Tanzu refers to a single VSphere cluster.  Not multiple clusters, so surely this is wrong.\n\nC. It enables vSphere High Availability and Distributed Resource Scheduler. - No, VSphere does that, silly.\n\nD. It exposes a Kubernetes API for use by DevOps teams.  - I suppose it does, but it's not the obvious answer.   Yet, if we eliminate the rest, this is all that's left."

Integrates with container-based PaaS such as Docker - No, and I think whenever an answer involves \"Docker\" instead of kubernetes we should be cautious, as the whole purpose of Kubernetes and Tanzu is that you can use Docker without getting your hands dirty with it.\n\n\nC. Creates an NSX-T logical topology for a Kubernetes cluster and a separate logical network for each Kubernetes namespace - Yes, a simple think about multi-guess answers in exams is the longest is often the right one.  In this case NSX creates separate segments for namespaces so this is a very reasonable answer.\n\nD. Configures Overlay Transport Zones - No, this should have been done as part of the NSX deployment already, I think.\n\nE.

Compatibility with NSX-V Datacenter - No, this is a trap.  You might see NSX-V and think NSX-T and choose this one, but NSX-V is deprecated.\n\nD. Compatibility with vSphere HA and DRS - Yes, in fact this is a prerequisite for creating a workload cluster.  Sure, you can't VMotion, because that's not supported, but DRS is useful for placement.\n\nE. Compatibility with Windows and Linux kernels - No, not compatible with Windoze."

Also, this *does not show the versions of the nodes in the TKC!!!*\nB. kubectl explain tkg dev-cluster - No, \"explain\" is not the correct syntax\nC. kubectl get version - Typo?  \"kubectl version\", shows the version of Kubernetes.  This seems the most obvious answer from all choices, which are all wrong.\nD. kubectl get vm dev-cluster - No, this is not the correct syntax, Kubernetes is not about VMs (heck, you can have your nodes on bare metal if you really want). \n\nIf you sit the exam, watch this question, I'd bet cash money \"kubectl version\" is one of the answers."

Creating a network policy that allows pods on the same segment to talk to each other won't work.  The question says only the prod app server can access the DB.  Well, if you use this rule, then anything on that segment can talk access the DB.   Fail!\n\nB - No, this is wrong, we won't use NSX to do this.  What if it's not an NSX based solution?  Tanzu does not always use NSX!\n\nC - Yes, this will work.  The app server and DB reside in the same pod.  If we prevent other pods talking to it, then the DB server can only talk to the app server and we satisfy the question requirement.\n\nD - This is the \"joke\" answer that is silly on purpose.  Of course we can achieve this with a network policy."

The whole point of Tanzu is that you can do a lot of administration through vCenter and kubectl.  \n\nB. By ensuring each TKG cluster has a quotas and permissions system built into it natively which enforces all requests\n\nThis is true, and I guess the best answer.   TKG clusters and namespaces leverage inbuilt quota and permissions systems, and these do enforce all requests. \n\nC. By having the Supervisor Cluster poll the TKG cluster periodically to ensure adherence to quotas and permissions\n\nNo... polling is not the way this is done (and a terrible idea because you can do what you want between polls?  Ha...)\n\nD. By deploying an external authentication solution\n\nNo, this is certainly handled by TKG, no need for an external one. \n\nWhile \"A\" looks compelling, \"B\" seems a better answer.

Decrease the number of worker nodes to 4. - Yes, when we talk about horizontal scaling, we talk about how many nodes, when we talk about vertical, that's the size of the nodes (same is true for pods). \nC. Update the Virtual Machine Class Type. - No... this would be correct if the question asked about vertical scaling, but it doesn't, does it?  No, it doesn't. \nD. Update the Kubernetes version to the latest supported version. - No.  This is the silly joke answer."

Permissions define who has access to the namespace and what actions they are allowed to perform within that namespace. By configuring the appropriate permissions, you grant users the necessary rights to deploy and manage workloads in the namespace."

Limits - Yes, this is also required\n\nSo we have three very correct answers and one somewhat correct answer, but VMware only wants one for the exam.  I'll go with \"B\" because it's the first thing you must do, but this is an awful question, and perhaps in the actual exam, the wording for the question may be different."

A load balancer provides external access to Supervisor Clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.\n\nIn vSphere with Tanzu using the vSphere networking stack, a load balancer is typically used to provide external access to Supervisor Clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. It helps distribute incoming traffic among the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster and allows external clients to access services deployed in the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. The load balancer ensures high availability and efficient distribution of traffic to the appropriate resources within the environment."
