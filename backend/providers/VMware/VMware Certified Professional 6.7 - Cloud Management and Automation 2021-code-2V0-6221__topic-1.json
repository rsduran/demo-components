Based on this understanding:\n\nB. **Native MDM enrollment**: This refers to the process where IT admins can enroll devices into management via the Windows 10 built-in MDM client. This is typically IT-driven because it can be pre-configured by IT before the device reaches the end-user.\n\nC. **Command Line Interface (CLI) staging**: This involves using command-line tools to stage or prepare a device for a user. It's a process that's usually done by IT before the device is handed over to the end-user.\n\nThese methods are controlled by IT, rather than being self-service options for end-users, making them IT-driven onboarding workflows. Options A, D, and E involve scanning a QR code, manually adding a device, or scanning a barcode, respectively, which can be part of user-driven enrollment workflows."
