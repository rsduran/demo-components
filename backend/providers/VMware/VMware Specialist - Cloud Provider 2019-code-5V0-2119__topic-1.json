The question doesn't say that VUM requires the results of Online Health Check but that you shall have the connectivity working properly in order to have the \"vSAN HCL DB up-to-date\"\n\nI hope this helps to clarify."

So if data has lost there is no chance to rebuild.\nc- If the objects of a vm is failed hosts yes you might experience inaccessibility.\nd- FTT=2 with 5 hosts mean raid-1 with 3 copies. If 2 copies are on the failed hosts still there is one copy, so it is not possible to lose data.\ne- After 2 hosts failure, there are 3 hosts survive. Think 3 copies of Group-B are there and put the one host in maintenance impact compliance of FTT=2."

If the host will only be in maintenance mode for a few minutes it doesn\u2019t make sense to completely rebuild all the objects on a different host. If the host will be offline for more than the default 60 minutes the administrator can modify the vSAN Object repair timer. As of vSAN 6.7 U1 this setting is available in the UI.

Remember that vSAN is a cluster based storage solution, and VM data is not necessarily always residing on the host that the VM is residing.  While it might seem odd to check look at performance metrics at this level as the second step, it can often help provide an understanding to the level of activity across the cluster.  For example, perhaps a VM latency spikes occur during the middle of the night.  After identifying the VM level statistics, viewing the cluster level statistics might show a substantial amount of noise coming from other VMs, or perhaps backend resynchronization traffic.  To view the vSAN cluster based performance metrics, highlight the cluster, click on Monitor &gt; vSAN &gt; Performance to view the respective VM, backend, or iSCSI performance metrics.\n\nhttps://core.vmware.com/resource/troubleshooting-vsan-performance"

This feature enables an iSCSI initiator on a remote host to transport block-level data to an iSCSI target on a storage device in the vSAN cluster, allowing the discovery of vSAN iSCSI targets from a remote host. vSAN 6.7 and later releases support Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC), allowing WSFC nodes to access vSAN iSCSI targets.\nTo ensure high availability of the vSAN iSCSI target, configure multipath support for your iSCSI application. You can use the IP addresses of two or more hosts to configure the multipath.\n\nNote: The vSAN iSCSI target service does not support other vSphere, ESXi clients, initiators, third-party hypervisors, or migrations using raw device mapping (RDM).\n\nTaken from vSAN 6.7 Deploy and Manage Lecture Manual - vSAN iSCSI Target Service Section"

To mitigate this risk, place the servers in a vSAN cluster across server racks and configure a fault domain for each rack in the vSAN UI. This instructs vSAN to distribute components across server racks to eliminate the risk of a rack failure taking multiple objects offline.

In a traditional vSAN cluster, redundant components are spread across servers in separate computing racks, and as a result, can tolerate rack failures, cache and capacity device failures, network device failures, and power failures.\nWhen used in a stretched cluster, fault domains spread redundancy components across sites, and therefore can tolerate the failure of an entire data site.\nThe minimum number of hosts in a stretched cluster is three, one host in each data site plus the witness host in the witness site.\nThe maximum number of hosts in a stretched cluster is 31, fifteen hosts in each data site plus the witness host in the witness site.\n\nTaken from vSAN 6.7 Deploy and Manage Lecture Manual - Stretched Cluster Architecture section"

In essence, objects either need to have 0% OSR (thin) or 100% OSR (fully reserved \u2013 thick). You cannot have any values in-between. If you already have VMs deployed with an OSR value that is somewhere in between, you will not be able to enable deduplication and compression. It will error as shown here:"
