Supports migration with or without vMotion and storage vMotion. Supports migration to a different vCenter Server instance... Well hesitating there as this may be usefull is users want to perform manula vmotions. \nAlso there is some incorrect wording in answer C - and if this would be more related to power off and then power on operations.

First, let\u2019s see what will happen if you have 6 hosts within your cluster, you have applied a policy containing FTT=2/RAID-6, and you want to place a host in maintenance mode using the \u2018Full data migration\u2019 option. This means all the data residing on the host will be evacuated to another host within the cluster. With this type of data configuration, the system will prompt you to add an additional host to the cluster in order to preserve the policy compliance. The policy will always require there must be two failures that can be tolerated, even during cluster reduction due to maintenance mode removing a host. Note that a minimum of six hosts is required to support a storage policy with RAID-6(FTT=2) erasure coding"

So data that has FTT2 won't be accessible, but those without redundancy will be? Haha.\nD - More than one component of any VM will never be on the same host (&lt;255GB) because vSAN treats each host as a separate fault domain."

HCI Mesh brings together multiple independent vSAN clusters for a native, cross-cluster architecture that disaggregates resources and enables utilization of stranded capacity. Simply, vSAN allows one or more vSAN clusters to remotely mount datastores from other vSAN clusters (servers) within vCenter inventory. This approach maintains the essence and simplicity of HCI by not fundamentally changing the existing HCI model or requiring specialized hardware. Now, a cluster with excess compute can mount excess storage from a remote vSAN cluster."

VMware Cloud Foundation.\n\nVMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides a unified SDDC (Software-Defined Data Center) platform for the hybrid cloud, integrating vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and vRealize Suite into a single platform for consistent infrastructure and operations. It includes automation capabilities for deploying and managing the entire stack, including vSAN Stretched Clusters, which helps streamline the deployment process and reduces administrative efforts.\n\nWhile vRealize Automation (option B) and vRealize Orchestrator (option D) are automation tools that can be used for deploying and orchestrating various components, VMware Cloud Foundation is specifically designed to simplify the deployment and management of the entire SDDC stack, making it the most suitable choice for this scenario."

For stretched clusters, read locality is force to 100% to ensure that data is read from the local site.\n\nReference below from: https://core.vmware.com/resource/vsan-stretched-cluster-guide#the-vsan-witness-host\n\nIn traditional vSAN clusters, a virtual machine\u2019s read operations are distributed across all replica copies of the data in the cluster. In the case of a policy setting of NumberOfFailuresToTolerate =1, which results in two copies of the data, 50% of the reads will come from replica 1 and 50% from replica 2. In the case of a policy setting of NumberOfFailuresToTolerate =2 in non-stretched vSAN clusters, it results in three copies of the data, 33% of the reads will come from replica 1, 33% of the reads will come from replica 2, and 33% will come from replica 3.\n\nIn a vSAN Stretched Cluster, we wish to avoid increased latency caused by reading across the inter-site link. The read locality mechanism was introduced to ensure that 100% of reads occur on the site the VM resides on. Read locality overrides the NumberOfFailuresToTolerate=1 policy\u2019s behavior to distribute reads across the components."
