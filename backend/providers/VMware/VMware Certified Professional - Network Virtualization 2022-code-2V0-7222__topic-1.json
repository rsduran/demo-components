This means the call does not go through the Spring proxy, and hence, the REQUIRES_NEW propagation on update2 is not recognized. As a result, there is only one transaction, which is the one initiated by update1.\n\nIf update2 were to be called in a way that went through the proxy, such as through another Spring-managed bean, a new transaction would indeed be started because of the REQUIRES_NEW propagation.

Wouldn't it create a new transaction? \n\nNormally yes, however, In this case, the update2() method is being called in the same class as the first update(), making it an internal call. \n\nWhen the first update method was called the @Transactional annotation passed the method execution to the interceptor, which created a proxy for the transaction (Spring AOP). When the Internal call to the second update2() method was executed, it couldn't be intercepted by a new interceptor, therefore, it couldn't create its own transactional proxy, which means it cannot create a new transaction. \n\nIf you don't understand this concept right away, don't worry.

There is no problem with the same \"foo\" variable name of two different beans in one class (C and B injections), as the variable scopes are different, and in practice, in case C the foo1 bean can be used and processed immediately (first) or reassigned to another variable name, therefore with this injection configuration the injection of all three beans foo1, foo2, foo3 is possible."

ApplicationContext is a subinterface of BeanFactory and provides additional functionalities.\n\nB. Incorrect - The ApplicationContext eagerly initializes beans by default. If you want lazy initialization, you need to explicitly configure it.\n\nC. Correct - The ApplicationContext can indeed be created in various environments, including test environments, web applications, and standalone applications. Different implementations of ApplicationContext are available for different use cases.\n\nD. Incorrect - The ApplicationContext includes all the functionality of the BeanFactory and provides additional features. It is a more feature-rich container compared to BeanFactory.\n\nE. Correct - The ApplicationContext does maintain singleton beans that are instantiated by the Spring runtime. Singleton scope is the default scope for beans in the ApplicationContext."
