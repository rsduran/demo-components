Since we have to use VM templates due to version control and other requirements of the question, then the way to replicate VM templates to subscribers is to use publishing. VMware is a bit confusing on this topic, but here is the documentation that clearly says you have to publish the library to subscribers in order to replicate VM templates: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-6345F652-4D9C-44AF-9D4C-5495CEB9999D.html\n(this is different than creating a subscription for a published local library)\n\nIn addition, if you publish to a new subscriber then the content is automatically replicated. If you publish to an existing subscriber then you have to trigger it. \n\nSee also https://williamlam.com/2023/05/benefits-of-vm-templates-vmtx-in-vsphere-content-library.html"

VMware vSphere Fault Tolerance (FT) can be utilized to provide continuous availability for vCenter Server by having identical vCenter Server virtual machines running on separate hosts. A transparent failover occurs if the host running the Primary vCenter Server virtual machine fails, in which case the Secondary vCenter Server virtual machine is immediately activated to replace the failed virtual machine. A new secondary virtual machine is started and Fault Tolerance redundancy is reestablished automatically. Because support of FT for up to 4 virtual CPUs (vCPU) is available only in vSphere 6.0 Enterprise Plus edition, FT can only be used to protect vCenter Server for the tiny and small deployment type, 2 vCPU and 4 vCPU, respectively."

With profile 1 we have 6 hosts where with profile 2 only 3, so failure domain would be bigger.\nC is not relevant at all\nD procurement cost is equal, for both profiles and not sure wat they mean with maintenance (electricity?cooling?operational cost?) but it would be similar as well for both\nE makes perfect sense with B, also scale-out,scale-up strategy, and vmware mentions this in 7.1 section of Designing vSphere Host Clusters book.

However, for an all-flash VSAN config, it states a 10GbE+ connection as it may consume higher bandwidth for higher throughput. (See below)\n\nhttps://core.vmware.com/resource/vmware-vsan-design-guide#section4\nIn vSAN hybrid configurations, VMware supports 1Gb, 10Gb, 25Gb, 40Gb, and 100Gb Network Interface Cards (NICs) for vSAN network traffic. If a 1Gb NIC is used, VMware requires that this NIC is dedicated to vSAN traffic. If a 10Gb or higher bandwidth NICs are used, these can be shared with other network traffic types. While VMware has successfully run smaller hybrid vSAN deployments over 1Gb, the best practice is to use 10Gb links.\n\nvSAN all-flash configurations are only supported with a 10Gb or higher connections. One reason for this is that the improved performance with an all-flash configuration may consume more network bandwidth between the hosts to gain higher throughput."

Therefore, I agree with D wher profile 1 placed on cluster 2. But I don't understand option A why profile 2 should be placed on cluster 1 since it has TPS sharing enabled. Isn't the TPS a mem sharing technique?\n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc/GUID-FEAC3A43-C57E-49A2-8303-B06DBC9054C5.html"
