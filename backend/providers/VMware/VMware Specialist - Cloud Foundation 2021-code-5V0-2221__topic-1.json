For example: I/O is flowing and the object is accessible. However, VSAN is not working on re-protecting the object. This is not due to the delay timer (reduced availability - no rebuild - delay timer) but due to other reasons. This could be because there are not enough resources in the cluster, or this could be because there was not enough resources in the past, or there was a failure to re-protect in the past and VSAN has yet to retry. Refer to the limits health check for a first assessment if any resources may be exhausted. You have to resolve the failure or add resources as quickly as possible in order to get back to being fully protected against a subsequent failure."

We have six hosts, so R6 can be configured, but there will be no rack awareness. You could also build 3 fault domains manually at the rack level. You then have only 3 fault domains and R6 will not be possible in this case. with 3 fault domains you could use only PFTT=1 and Mirroring."

When you change VM storage policy settings, vSAN might initiate object recreation and subsequent resynchronization of the objects.\nCertain policy changes might cause vSAN to create another version of an object and synchronize it with the previous version. When the synchronization is complete, the original object is discarded.\n\nvSAN ensures that VMs continue to run, and resynchronization does not interrupt their operation. This process might require additional temporary capacity.\n\nRestarting a host after a failure.\nRecovering hosts from a permanent or long-term failure. If a host is unavailable for more than 60 minutes (by default), vSAN creates copies of data to recover the full policy compliance.\nEvacuating data by using the Full data migration mode before you place a host in maintenance mode.\nExceeding the capacity threshold of a capacity device. Resynchronization is triggered when a capacity device in the vSAN cluster approaches or exceeds the threshold level of 80 percent."

So, if you have already created your disk groups and have no other disk groups available (unclaimed), it might be necessary to simply evacuate the data from an existing disk group and recreate it by specifying the vSAN Direct option. If you are able to add more disks to your host and create another disk group, this would be the second option for achieving the configuration.\nvSAN License\u2014You'll need a VMware vSAN license installed and activated for that particular cluster. But you already knew this if you were going for a vSAN-based cluster, right? If you're new to VMware and if you have a Standard or Enterprise license, this license itself does not entitle you to create and configure a vSAN cluster. You need a vSAN license."
