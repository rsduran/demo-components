It is also easy to add additional capacity by inserting new  agnetic disks to a disk group in hybrid (orflash devices for all-flash). But it could be much more difficult to add additional cache capacity. This is especially true if    there is a need to swap out the current cache device and replace it with a newer larger one.  Of course, this approach is also much more expensive. It is far easier to overcommit on flash resources to begin with rather than trying to increase it once vSAN is in production.\n\nDesign decision: Design with additional flash cache to allow easier scale up of the capacity layer. Alternatively scaling up cache and capacity at the same time through the  addition of new disks groups is also an easier approach than trying to simply update the existing flash cache device in an existing disk group.\n\nhttps://core.vmware.com/resource/vmware-vsan-design-guide#sec6843-sub8"
