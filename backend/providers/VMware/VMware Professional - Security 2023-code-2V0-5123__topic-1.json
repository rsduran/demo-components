In VMware Horizon, when a user-assigned application is already natively installed on the virtual machine (VM), the natively installed application takes precedence over the App Volume package. Consequently, the App Volume package for the user-assigned application will not be attached or mounted to the VM. The system recognizes that the application is already present on the VM, and this behavior is designed to prevent conflicts and ensure efficient integration with the operating system and other applications on the VM. If you encounter any issues related to App Volumes, you can refer to VMware\u2019s documentation for troubleshooting guidance."
