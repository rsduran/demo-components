In this way, administrators can apply governance constraints directly at the project level. All constraints added at this level are applied to every cloud template requested for the applicable project, and these constraint tags take precedence over other tags.\n\nIf constraint tags on the project conflict with constraint tags on the cloud template, the project tags take precedence, thus allowing the cloud administrator to enforce governance rules. For example, if the cloud administrators creates a location:london tag on the project, but a developer places a location:boston tag on the cloud template, the former will take precedence and the resource is deployed to infrastructure containing the location:london tag."
