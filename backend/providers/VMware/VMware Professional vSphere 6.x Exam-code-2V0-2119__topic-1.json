This can cause lag on the VM if other VMs are using the host CPU at the time.  A good rule of thumb is, when sizing your VM, if the CPU utilization in the guest is on average below 20% at all times, reduce the number of vCPUs. If the VM is at 100% CPU utilization all the time, up the vCPU count. This will help with minimizing and maximizing your VMs to get the most CPU performance that they can get.\n\nAnother metric to watch for when provisioning resources is CPU RDY Time. This is the metric vSphere uses to record the length of time that a VM was scheduled to perform a task but couldn\u2019t due to having to wait for CPU. The threshold to look for is usually 10%. Anything higher will usually be experiencing some slowness. How do I find the CPU RDY time? Easy, just like the example above with the NUMA nodes, we will use ESXTOP. So SSH into a host and type in the following:"

For non-IP packets, whatever is at those offsets is used to compute the hash.\nRoute based on a source MAC hash: Choose an uplink based on a hash of the source Ethernet.\nUse explicit failover order: Always use the highest order uplink from the list of Active adapters which passes failover detection criteria.\nRoute based on physical NIC load (Only available on Distributed Switch): Choose an uplink based on the current loads of physical NICs."

This monitoring does not detect configuration errors, such as a physical switch port being blocked by the Spanning Tree Protocol or misconfigured VLAN membership. This method cannot detect upstream, nondirectly connected physical switch or cable failures.\nBeaconing introduces a 62-byte packet load approximately every 1 second per physical NIC. When beaconing is activated, the VMkernel sends out and listens for probe packets on all NICs that are configured as part of the team. This technique can detect failures that link-status monitoring alone cannot. Consult your switch manufacturer to verify the support of beaconing in your environment.
