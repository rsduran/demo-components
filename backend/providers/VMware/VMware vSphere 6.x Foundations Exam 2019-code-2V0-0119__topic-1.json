VMkernel networks are not used by these hosts for vSphere HA communications. To contain vSphere HA traffic to a subset of the ESX console networks, use the allowedNetworks advanced option.\n\nOn ESXi hosts in the cluster, vSphere HA communications, by default, travel over VMkernel networks. With an ESXi host, if you want to use a network other than the one vCenter Server uses to communicate with the host for vSphere HA, you must explicitly enable the Management traffic check box."
