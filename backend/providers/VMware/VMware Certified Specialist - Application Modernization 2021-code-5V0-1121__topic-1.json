(maybe this one technically?)\nC - Weird - HCX doesn't configure EVC - You can configure evc on a per VM basis on-prem though.  If the VM was on a distributed switch you could use L2 stretch, but thats not mentioned.\nD - Werid - Bandwidth minimum for HCX to work is 100 mbps.  HCX does not change EVC - Sure, you can take a VM running on old and move it to new, but thats only because it's using CPU instructions the new hosts fully understands. \nE - NO - You can't change EVC settings on an SDDC cluster.
