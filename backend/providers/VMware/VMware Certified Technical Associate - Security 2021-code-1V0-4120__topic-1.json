To achieve L2 extension, hardware-based solutions such as OTV are used, but this does not address the security or automation aspects and only focuses on the network and per-device configuration.\n\nHowever, when leveraging the Cross-VC NSX feature for multi-site and disaster recovery, you can easily apply L2 extension over an L3 underlay across vCenter domains. Cross-VC NSX allows for consistent logical networking and security across multiple vCenter domains and allows disaster recovery tools such as Site Manager Recovery to recover the workloads at the recovery site while maintaining the IP address."

It is responsible for forwarding the data plane traffic originating from VMs, containers or apps running on bare metal servers. NSX-T supports the various types of transport nodes including: Hypervisor (ESXi or KVM), Bare Metal (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu), and NSX Edge. Since NSX-T is decoupled from the hypervisor, ESXi and KVM transport nodes can work together and networks and topologies can extend to both ESXi and KVM environments."
