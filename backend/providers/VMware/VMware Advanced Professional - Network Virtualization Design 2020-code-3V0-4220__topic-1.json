Virtual switches\nare passive devices and do not support trunking protocols, such as Dynamic Trunking\nProtocol (DTP).\n- Modify the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) on any port that is connected to an ESXi NIC to\nreduce the time to transition ports over to the forwarding state, for example using the Trunk\nPortFast feature found in a Cisco physical switch.\n- Provide DHCP or DHCP Helper capabilities on all VLANs used by TEP VMkernel ports. This\nsetup simplifies the configuration by using DHCP to assign IP address based on the IP subnet\nin use.\n- Configure jumbo frames on all switch ports, inter-switch link (ISL), and switched virtual\ninterfaces (SVIs).\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Validated-Design/5.0.1/vmware-validated-design-501-sddc-nsxt-workload-architecture-design.pdf"

SNAT also tracks the reply.\n\u2022 Destination NAT (DNAT) enables access to internal private IP addresses from the outside world by translating the destination IP address when inbound communication is initiated. DNAT also takes care of the reply. For both SNAT and DNAT, users can apply NAT rules based on the 5-tuple match criteria.\n\u2022 Reflexive NAT rules are stateless access control lists (ACLs) that must be defined in both directions. These rules do not track the connection. Reflexive NAT rules are applied when stateful NAT cannot be used. For example, when a Tier-0 gateway is running in active-active equal-cost multipath (ECMP) mode, you cannot configure stateful NAT because asymmetrical paths might cause issues."
