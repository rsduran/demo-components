It provides the capability to migrate content between instances of vRealize Automation.\n\nMaybe - It \"might\" if you're triggering ABX to do a migration... but that's an unlikely use case for ABX.   And you would have to do some complex automation work for this to happen.\n\nB. It provides efficient capacity and cost management for managed virtual machines\n\nNo - ABX has nothing to do with capacity and cost management. \n\nC. It provides intelligent remediation and integrated compliance for security patches.\n\nMaybe - It \"might\" if you write a lot of automation to do this job and use ABX to trigger it.  Once more, an unlikely use case.\n\nD. It provides a way to execute stateless function, which contain reusable parameterized actions.\n\nYes - This is an accurate description of ABX. \n\nOnce more remember that in multi choice tests, eliminating wrong answers can be as useful as guessing at the right one.

Yes, it is true that the template must be shared with the appropriate project, BUT, before you can even use it in ANY project, the template MUST be versioned so that a version can be 'Released' and be available in Service Broker at all. Also, in the question, there is a statement that a 'new' template is created, this further makes it clear since a new template always must have a released version. If there was a comment about an existing template version etc, then projects might make more sense.

To store the code dependency artifacts for your continuous integration task, which can save time in code builds, you can use a cache.\n\nIn the pipeline task that builds and tests your code, you can include several continuous integration steps. These steps can reside in the same working directory where vRealize Automation Code Stream clones the source code when the pipeline triggers.\n\nTo deploy your code to the Kubernetes cluster, you can use a Kubernetes task in your pipeline. You must then enable and run your pipeline. Then, make a change to your code in the repository, and watch the pipeline trigger. To monitor and report on your pipeline trends after your pipeline runs, use the dashboards.\n\nIn the following example, to create a continuous integration pipeline that continuously integrates your code into your pipeline, you use the continuous integration smart pipeline template. This example uses a Docker workspace."
