Who is to say you're working for a medium sized business and the operator and tenant are the same?  This is just a bad question.  T1 gateways are scoped towards this function which is why this is a \"close\" answer.\n\nC. always configured in active-standby mode - Yes, T1 gateways are always active/standby mode.\n\nD. owned and configured by Service Provider - Potentially... again, it's a bad question.  \"B\" is closer than this answer so we should choose that over this.   But it could be true there's T1 gateways that are owned and configured by the service provider!\n\nE. connects to physical networks - No, this is a T0 North/South thing.\n\nSo.... we choose B and C, because \"B\" is close to being true.
