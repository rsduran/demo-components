During this stage, the development team and stakeholders gather feedback from users and continuously refine and improve the product backlog based on user feedback and changing requirements.\n\nThe \"Optimize\" stage is where regular backlog refinement occurs to ensure that the backlog remains up-to-date, reflects the most important features and user stories, and aligns with the changing needs of the users and the business.

Related action visibility: The related action itself may have visibility conditions, restricting its display based on certain criteria.\n\nC.

Record list actions can be configured to open in a dialog, the same tab, or a new tab. After completing a record list action, users return to the record list. When actions are configured to open in a dialog, any user filter values are remembered when returning to the record list.\nA common use case is to add an action to \"create a new record\". This allows users to leverage the record list search to ensure the record in question does not already exist. It also allows developers to use their five site pages more efficiently by combining record and action functionality.\nBy default, record list actions display on the record list. Optionally, you can also configure record list actions to display in interfaces.\nhttps://docs.appian.com/suite/help/23.2/record-actions.html"

The first flow executes successfully, and the remaining will wait indefinitely."
