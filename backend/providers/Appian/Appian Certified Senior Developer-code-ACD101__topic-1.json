This ensures consistency between Appian's definition (CDT) and the actual database structure.\nCDT Update in Appian: After manually updating the database schema, rename the corresponding field within the CDT in Appian to match the new database column name. This step keeps the Appian definition aligned with the database.\nData Store Verification and Publishing: Finally, verify and publish the data store in Appian. This process validates the changes made to the CDT against the database schema and ensures Appian can interact with the data correctly."
