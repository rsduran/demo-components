The issue is that the exception caught by Recover2 will not be preserved by the Re-Throw Exception stage. In Blue Prism, a Re-Throw Exception stage can only re-throw exceptions caught by the nearest preceding Recover stage. In this case, the Re-Throw Exception stage is located after Recover1, so it can only re-throw exceptions caught by Recover1.\n\nThe Re-Throw Exception stage does not have the capability to preserve and re-throw exceptions from multiple Recover stages. If there is a need to preserve exceptions caught by multiple Recover stages, an alternative approach might be needed, such as handling the exceptions at a higher level or passing exception-related information through outputs or data items."

Without proper navigation or actions to reset the application, subsequent retries might not yield the desired outcome.\n\nThe retry loop should include steps to ensure that the application is back in the correct state for the 'Search Screen' -&gt; 'Perform Search' action. This could involve navigating back to a starting point, resetting data, validating conditions, or any other actions required to prepare for another attempt. This would make the retry loop more effective and increase the chances of success in subsequent retries."

In this case, you would type the desired exception type in the Exception Type field (for example, \"BusinessException\") and provide a custom exception detail message in the Exception Detail field (such as \"A new Business exception occurred\").\n\nSince you want to throw a new exception and not preserve the details of the current exception, you should leave the \"Preserve the type and detail of the current exception\" checkbox unticked.\n\nOption A describes this configuration, making it the correct choice to throw a new Business exception with custom type and detail information."
