Querying stored predictions can be faster than computing predictions in real-time.\n\nIn this scenario, since the feature values needed for computing the predictions are available one week before the query time, the predictions can be precomputed using a batch serving deployment. When the predictions are needed, they can be quickly retrieved from storage, which can be faster than computing the predictions in real-time. This approach also allows for the efficient use of resources, as the computational work can be done during off-peak times."
