Descriptive statistics can help data analysts understand the main features of a data set, such as its central tendency, variability, or distribution. Descriptive statistics can also help data analysts visualize data using charts, graphs, or tables. Descriptive statistics do not make any inferences or predictions about the data, unlike inferential statistics, which use data analysis techniques to infer properties of an underlying population or probability distribution from a sample of data.Reference:Databricks - Descriptive Statistics,Databricks - Data Analysis with Databricks SQL"

        "content": "The mean value of a variable is the average of all the values in a data set, calculated by dividing the sum of the values by the number of values. The median value of a variable is the middle value of the ordered data set, or the average of the middle two values if the data sethas an even number of values. The mean value is sensitive to outliers, which are values that are very different from the rest of the data. Outliers can skew the mean value and make it less representative of the central tendency of the data. The median value is more robust to outliers, as it only depends on the middle values of the data.Therefore, when the variable contains a lot of extreme outliers, the mean value and the median value will be meaningfully different, as the mean value will be pulled towards the outliers, while the median value will remain close to the majority of the data1."
