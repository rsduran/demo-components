As stated in the question, 60% of the total RAM in the Nutanix cluster is in use (based on '192 GB RAM, 60% overall usage'), which amounts to 768 GB (192 GB per node * 4 nodes).\n\nThis means that only 40% of the remaining RAM in the cluster, equivalent to 307.2 GB (768 GB * 40%), is available for the creation of the five VMs. \n\nSince the total amount of vRAM needed for the five VMs is 320 GB (64 GB per VM * 5 VMs), it exceeds the available RAM (320 GB &gt; 307.2 GB), making Option A the correct answer."

In fact, inline compression typically increases effective performance by increasing the usable size of the SSD tier. In addition, when the system replicates larger or sequential data for protection, it can send compressed data, further increasing performance because less data crosses the wire. Inline compression also pairs perfectly with erasure coding."
