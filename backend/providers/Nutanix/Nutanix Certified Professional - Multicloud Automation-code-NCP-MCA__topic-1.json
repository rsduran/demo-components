The pre-create task helps to restrict the broadcast traffic to receive the IP addresses for those VMs during the service provision.\nhttps://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Self-Service-Admin-Operations-Guide-v3_7_1_1:nuc-app-mgmt-tasks-overview-c.html"

This trigger is specifically designed to capture VM deletion events and initiate the desired actions or notifications. When a VM is deleted, the Playbook associated with this trigger will be executed, allowing you to take appropriate steps based on your requirements. Remember to configure the Playbook to handle the notification method (e.g., email, webhook, etc.) according to your organization\u2019s needs."
