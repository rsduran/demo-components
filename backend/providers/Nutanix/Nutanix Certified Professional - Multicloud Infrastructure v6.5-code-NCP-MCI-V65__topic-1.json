This traffic uses eth2 on the CVM. In AHV, VM live migration traffic is also backplane, and uses the AHV backplane interface, VLAN, and virtual switch when configured. For nodes that have RDMA-enabled NICs, the CVMs use a separate RDMA LAN for Stargate-to-Stargate communications.\nManagement traffic\nManagement traffic is administrative traffic, or traffic associated with Prism and SSH connections, remote logging, SNMP, and so on. The current implementation simplifies the definition of management traffic to be any traffic that is not on the backplane network, and therefore also includes communications between user VMs and CVMs. This traffic uses eth0 on the CVM.\n\nA seems to be the answer that fits best."

It allows frequently accessed data to be cached on SSDs, reducing latency.\nIf the VMs' vDisks are spread across multiple storage containers, and some of these containers are not utilizing flash mode effectively, it can lead to latency issues for the VMs whose vDisks are not benefiting from flash acceleration."

If you are performing a fresh installation of Windows on an AHV VM, use the VirtIO ISO. If you are updating VirtIO for Windows on an existing VM, use the VirtIO MSI installer file.\nThe latest VirtIO drivers can be downloaded from the Nutanix Support Portal. To download the latest versions:\nAccess the Downloads section on the Support Portal, and select AHV.\n Select VirtIO in the drop-down menu and download the required VirtIO package.

In a properly configured LAN failover setup, the guest VMs should continue to respond to pings even when one interface is disconnected, as the traffic should be rerouted through the remaining active interfaces.\n\nGiven the options, the most likely cause of this issue is C. Switch ports are configured with different VLANs. If the two network interfaces are connected to switch ports configured with different VLANs, then disconnecting one interface could cause the guest VMs in one VLAN to become unreachable. This would explain why pings to the hypervisor continue (as it may have access to all VLANs), but pings to the guest VMs stop when one interface is disconnected."

Remember to re-enable affinity rules afterward if they are essential for your environment"

If you have VM affinity rules configured on your cluster, particularly affinity rules that restrict which nodes the VM can migrate to, then LCM can run slowly while waiting for ADS to migrate the VMs.\n\nIf you have configured affinity rules that do not allow VMs to migrate, then the LCM precheck test_esx_entering_mm_pinned_vms fails and LCM updates cannot continue.\n\nTo avoid update failures or delays due to affinity rules, disable any VM affinity rules before beginning an LCM update and re-enable the rules after performing the update.\"\nhttps://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Life-Cycle-Manager-Guide-v2_4:top-lcm-update-t.html"
