An Image Placement Policy is a set of rules that determine where an image should be placed on the Nutanix cluster. These rules are based on categories, such as the image's OS type, the target cluster's hardware type, and other factors. By creating image placement policies, you can ensure that images are placed on the appropriate clusters, and that they are compatible with the hardware and software requirements of those clusters."

These policies, called image placement policies, map images to target clusters through the use of categories associated with both those entities. For example, an image placement policy might state that Linux images associated with the categories OS:Linux and distribution:Centos must be uploaded to clusters associated with the category location:SFO.\n\nImage placement policies also specify how strictly the policy must be enforced. Soft enforcement allows clusters not identified by the policy to use the images, when required, by checking them out. Hard enforcement disallows such usage. By using both soft and hard enforcement on the same category of clusters, you can address more specific use cases."

Nutanix Objects is a S3-compatible object storage solution that provides a highly\nscalable and durable storage for unstructured data. It is built on top of the Nutanix Distributed File\nSystem (NDFS) and provides a high-performance, scalable, and highly available storage solution.\nOne of the key features of Nutanix Objects is its ability to support Microsoft SQL Server Always On\nAvailability Groups (AAG) on S3 object storage. This allows you to deploy a highly available SQL\ncluster on Nutanix, with the ability to failover SQL services to a different node in the event of a\nfailure, and provide high availability and disaster recovery for SQL databases."
