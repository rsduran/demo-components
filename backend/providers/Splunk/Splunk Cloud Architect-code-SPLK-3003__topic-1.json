If this other copy is live, then the bucket will remain searchable. If only replica copies are available, the data will no longer be searchable.\n\nAny bucket frozen in a cluster is only frozen *on that instance*, however, the peer will notify the CM.

HEC is a data ingestion method that enables external systems to send data directly to Splunk via a REST API over HTTP or HTTPS. Inputs.conf monitor stanza is used to monitor local and network files for changes and ingest the data into Splunk.\n\nOptions A and C are not recommended because they involve collecting data actively by monitoring systems and listening on ports. This approach can be resource-intensive and may affect the performance of the clustered indexers.\n\nOption D includes Splunk TCP and TCP-SSL, which are not commonly used for data ingestion on clustered indexers. These protocols are typically used for data forwarding between Splunk instances or for inputs that require secure communication, such as Splunk Enterprise Security."

As a result, the lookup cannot be used by search peers during distributed searches.\n\nHowever, when the \"local=true\" parameter is specified in the lookup command, it tells Splunk to perform the lookup locally on the search head, rather than using a distributed search to perform the lookup on the indexers. This means that the lookup file does not need to be present on the search peers, and the search can be successfully executed even if the lookup has been blacklisted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: the customer needs to modify the search to ensure that the lookup command specifies parameter \"local=true\". Options B and C are not valid solutions to the problem described. Option D is incorrect as lookups can be blacklisted; however, it requires appropriate modifications to searches to avoid errors."

The subsearch within square brackets is searching the firewall index for the most recent high severity, denied event, and using the status command to get the latest time for that event. The eval command is then used to create earliest and latest fields for the web_log search, based on the time of the most recent denied event. The fields command at the end is used to limit the fields returned to earliest and latest."
