In B you have:\nnumber of peer nodes,\nbut you do not need that to calculate the disk usage as you don't care about number of peers only about the size of data and search factor + replication factor. Now it is said that you can see how much data comes in a day. Bucket = half the size so you can actually see the size of the bucket. So you do not need the size of the daily data.

B can be ruled out because hot buckets need the fastest performance possible, and NFS is relatively slow (it usually runs over non-dedicated networks that are slower than those used by SAN). C is valid because it is a performance option - RAID 10 is faster than RAID5/6 while providing better redundancy. D can be ruled out because virtualized environments will always give lower raw performance than bare metal (despite having other advantages)."
