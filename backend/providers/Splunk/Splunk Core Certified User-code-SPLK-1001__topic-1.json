For example, \"top limit=10 source\" would return the top 10 most common values for the \"source\" field. \nThe \"useperc\" constraint is used to specify whether to display the percentage of occurrences for each result. \nThe \"addtotals\" constraint is used to add a row to the results that displays the total number of occurrences for all values. \nThe \"fieldcount\" constraint is not a valid option to use with the top command."

So, \"-30m@h\" represents a time range that starts 30 minutes ago from the beginning of the current hour and ends at the beginning of the current hour.\n\nFor example, if the current time is 2:45 PM, \"-30m@h\" would represent the time range from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM. so answer is Yes it will look at time from 3.00-3.30"
