Inverted index (.tsidx) files may consume the most disk space within an index bucket.\n\nInverted index files (.tsidx) are used in search engines to map terms to the documents or records in which they occur. These files contain a list of all unique terms in the index bucket and the locations of those terms in the indexed documents. Because they contain information about every term in the index, they can be quite large, especially for large datasets with many unique terms.\n\nRawdata, bloom filter, and metadata files (.data) typically take up less space than inverted index files. Rawdata files contain the actual data that is being indexed, while bloom filters are used to quickly identify which terms are likely to be present in a document. Metadata files contain additional information about the indexed documents, such as timestamps or author names."
