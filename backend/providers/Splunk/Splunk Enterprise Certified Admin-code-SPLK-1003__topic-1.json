Configuration files operate in either a global context or in the context of the current app and user:\n\n    Global. Activities like indexing take place in a global context. They are independent of any app or user. For example, configuration files that determine monitoring or indexing behavior occur outside of the app and user context and are global in nature.\n\n    App/user. Some activities, like searching, take place in an app or user context. The app and user context is vital to search-time processing, where certain knowledge objects or actions might be valid only for specific users in specific apps."

It allows for the specification of regular expressions and other settings to extract, transform, and manipulate data.\n\nWhile inputs.conf (B) is indeed a crucial configuration file in Splunk, it's used for specifying the input data settings, such as the type of input, the path for data ingestion, and various parameters for data collection, rather than transforming the data.\n\nrawdata.conf (C) is not a standard configuration file in Splunk."

The deployment server is used to centrally manage configurations across multiple components in the deployment, and the license master is used to centrally manage Splunk licenses.

Search heads, and all Splunk instances, already have inputs built to read internal logs by default.  They just need an outputs.conf to create a tcpout stanza to your indexers to get them to send their internal logs, which is what this question is asking about.  In our Splunk environment we have NEVER set up an inputs for internal logs, we only deploy an outputs.conf with our indexers listed in a tcpout stanza, and we get all of our internal logs just fine.\n\nIf you had other logs on a search head (like from a script or something), then yes, you would need an inputs.conf to get those to be read.  But that is definitely not what this question is asking about."

Buying a bigger Splunk license would indeed solve the problem, but it's not the most cost-effective solution if you only need to index the historical data once.\n\nB. Adding 2.5 TB each day for the next 5 days would exceed the daily license volume of 500 GB, likely causing a license violation.\n\nC. Adding all 10 TB in a single 24-hour period would far exceed the daily volume allowed by the license, leading to a significant license violation.\n\nD. Adding 200 GB of historical data each day for 50 days would keep the total daily volume (new data + historical data) at 500 GB, avoiding any license violations. This approach utilizes the full capacity of the license without exceeding it, allowing the historical data to be indexed systematically over time without incurring additional costs or license issues."

There is one crucial difference: when you have indexer acknowledgment turned on, you must specify a channel when you send events.\n\nThe concept of a channel was introduced in HEC primarily to prevent a fast client from impeding the performance of a slow client. When you assign one channel per client, because channels are treated equally on Splunk Enterprise, one client can't affect another.\n\nYou must include a matching channel identifier both when sending data to HEC in an HTTP request and when requesting acknowledgment that events contained in the request have been indexed. If you don't, you will receive the error message, \"Data channel is missing.\" Each request that includes a token for which indexer acknowledgment has been enabled must include a channel identifier, as shown in the following example cURL statement, where &lt;data&gt; represents the event data portion of the request:"
