Blocking a supplier/vendor account centrally in SAP can prevent both posting and order processing, but it applies to all materials associated with that supplier/vendor, not just a specific material. If you want to block a specific material for procurement, you can do so by creating an entry in the source list with a blocking indicator and no supplier, or by using a relevant plant-specific material status in the material master. Therefore, creating a blocking entry in the supplier master record is not a correct method to completely block a material for procurement in a plant"
