SAP's integration technology portfolio covers all kinds of integration.\nThe reason it's not option B or C, \"SAP software by default supports any third-party integration,\" is that while SAP aims to provide comprehensive integration capabilities through the SAP Integration Suite, saying that SAP software supports any third-party integration \"by default\" might overstate the immediacy and ease of integration. Integrating with third-party systems often requires specific configurations, adapters, or custom development to ensure compatibility and seamless data exchange. The \"Open integration\" principle emphasizes the broad capability and intent to cover all types of integrations, but achieving integration with any third-party system can still involve additional steps to address specific requirements or use cases. Thus, option A more accurately reflects the suite's overarching goal and capability to support a wide range of integration scenarios, including but not limited to third-party systems."
