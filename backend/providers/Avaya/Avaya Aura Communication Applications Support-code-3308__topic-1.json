For Avaya Contact Recorders, this is a 6-digit number starting with 8. The serial number of each Master and Central Replay Server is allocated by Avaya as part of the licensing process.\nThe serial number of a Slave or Standby recorder is chosen by you. You should assign each Slave and Standby recorder in your enterprise a unique1 number from 1 to 9999. The serial number for these servers will then be shown as 880000 plus this locally chosen recorder number. The serial number defines the first 6 digits of the unique reference number given to each call recorded by the recorder. For example, the recorder with serial number 800001 records its first call into the following files:\n800001000000001.wav\n800001000000001.xml\nThe serial number is encoded within every activation key issued. Once a Master recorder or Central Replay Server has been configured with its initial activation key, subsequent keys must have a matching serial number."
