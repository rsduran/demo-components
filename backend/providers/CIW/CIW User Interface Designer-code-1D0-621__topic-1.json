How the code is written, and when and where it runs, not only impacts the data credibility but also the performance of your Web site.\n\n-Input Sanitization is a related concept. Sophisticated malicious users can do more damage than just submitting bad data. They can take advantage of security holes in old coding standards. A hacker can read, alter, or delete your entire database if your code is vulnerable. As an example, an attack might consist of adding special characters, usually single quotes, to form fields. The quotes will change the command from helpful to destructive. Modern programming languages all have methods to sanitize user input, but old programming habits die hard and there are millions of vulnerable sites on the Web."
