It specifies the data type and constraints that can be applied to the attribute. The domain defines the set of valid values for the attribute, ensuring data integrity and consistency within the database.\n\nFor example, a database domain for the \"Age\" attribute in a \"Person\" table might be defined as an integer data type with constraints that enforce that the age must be a positive number within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 120). This domain definition ensures that only valid and acceptable values are allowed for the \"Age\" attribute in the \"Person\" table. If any attempt is made to insert or update data violating this domain definition, the database management system will reject the operation, maintaining the integrity of the data."

This phenomenon occurs in concurrent database operations, where multiple transactions can access and modify the same data simultaneously.\n\nThe sequence of events in a dirty read scenario is as follows:\n\nTransaction A reads a value from a data item in the database.\nTransaction B updates the same data item but has not committed the changes yet.\nTransaction A reads the modified value (dirty data) before Transaction B has finished and committed its changes.\nThe problem with dirty reads is that Transaction A may obtain and act upon inaccurate or inconsistent data, which may lead to incorrect results or decisions. Dirty reads can cause data integrity issues and are generally considered undesirable in a database system."
