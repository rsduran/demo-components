The term \"reserved bandwith\" is different about \"active traffic\".\nEven if have no active trafic on the secondary path, the standby was configured with a reserv of 300Mb, so will be a reserve of 300Mb for this lsp.\n\nThe answer C woul be correct if the secondary path was not standby active. Only in this case the lsp will reserve the traffic wen the path is used, cause it ill be active only when the primary goes down"
