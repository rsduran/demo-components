Usually the command would show any one of the adjacency state. If the port or interface is Admin Down, the show command will not show any output/entry.\nLike if the neighbor has gone down, but the router is still sending Hello Packets, it will show Down. \nIf there is some kind of mismatch in the Neighbor adjacency during Hello packets, it will show Init. \nIf they have started to send DBD packets and not forming adjacency after that, it probably would be stuck as Exstart. \nPlease correct me if I'm wrong."
