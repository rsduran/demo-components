This means that for each individual marketing message or email, a unique UTM campaign value should be assigned. This will allow for detailed tracking and analytics for that specific campaign.\n\nFor example, if a particular campaign is labeled 'Winter_Sale', the UTM campaign value for all links within messages associated with that campaign would carry the UTM code 'utm_campaign=Winter_Sale'. This enables the company to identify which campaigns are driving the most traffic, or achieving other specific goals."
