This approach provides a balance between quick deployment and flexibility for future customization. Unmanaged packages can be quickly created and do not require the setup and maintenance overhead of managed packages, making them ideal for situations where an app developed in one Salesforce org needs to be replicated in another without the need for ongoing version control or distribution outside the organization. This will allow NTO to leverage the existing app immediately while retaining the ability to customize and integrate it further into their processes and systems as needed."
