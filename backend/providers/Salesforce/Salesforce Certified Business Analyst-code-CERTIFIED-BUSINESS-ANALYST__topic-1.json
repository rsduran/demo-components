Since the BA is working with the technical team in the current sprint to identity the metadata dependencies, I think Version Control (C) is the most appropriate tool to use. \nReasons: Change sets can take a while to create as components are added manually. Meaning dependencies are not immediately visible. Deployment errors are also common and can be time consuming to fix. Whereas Version Control Integrates with your favourite hosting provider such as GitHub, to have full visibility into what was changed, why, when, and by whom.\n\nSource: https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-devops/"

A daily stand-up is a short daily meeting where team members provide updates on their progress and discuss any obstacles they may be facing.

This approach provides enough detail to guide the interns through each step of importing leads into Salesforce without making it overly complicated. It balances the need for clarity and comprehensiveness with the usability and accessibility necessary for new learners. The process map should include clear steps, decision points, and perhaps annotated screenshots or icons to enhance understanding and retention, making it a practical tool for interns to rely on as they learn the new process."
