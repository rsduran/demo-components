Set the column with Subscriber Key as Primary Key:\nThe Subscriber Key is a unique identifier for each subscriber, and it is essential for identifying and managing individual subscribers in Marketing Cloud. When setting up the data extension, the column with the Subscriber Key should be designated as the Primary Key. This ensures that each record in the data extension is uniquely identified by the Subscriber Key, preventing any duplicates and allowing for accurate data management.\n\nD. In Properties, check the \"Is Sendable\" option:\nThe \"Is Sendable\" option in the Properties of the data extension should be checked to indicate that the data extension is eligible for use in email sends. Enabling this option allows the data extension to be used as a target for email campaigns and ensures that the data within the data extension can be sent to subscribers.\n\nOptions B (Set the Email address column as Primary Key) and C (Relate the Email Address to Subscriber Key) are not necessary or recommended"

To save the data extension: Setting accurate field lengths helps in efficient data storage within the data extension. If the field lengths are set too long, it may lead to unnecessary storage of empty or unused spaces, consuming more storage resources than required.

By using personalization, you can tailor the content of the email to each individual subscriber based on their preferences, behavior, or demographic information. Personalized emails are more relevant to the recipients, which can lead to higher engagement and conversion rates. For a targeted email campaign promoting new winter offerings, personalization could include using the subscriber's name, recommending products based on past purchases or browsing history, and customizing content based on their location or preferences related to winter products.\n\n\nOption B, \"Send to the entire subscriber base,\" is not a best practice in email marketing when it comes to targeted email campaigns. Sending emails to the entire subscriber base without proper segmentation can lead to sending irrelevant content to some subscribers, resulting in lower engagement and potentially higher unsubscribe rates."

Purchasing subscriber lists from third-party sources is generally not recommended as it may lead to low engagement and deliverability issues, and it can also be against anti-spam laws in many regions. Emailing unsubscribed customers to ask them to opt-in again can also be seen as unsolicited and may lead to compliance issues. It's better to focus on obtaining explicit and voluntary consent from subscribers."
