The impact of having a large number of custom objects related to an Account can be significant in terms of sharing calculations and record access times.\n\nCases, being a standard Salesforce object, are typically optimized for performance in large volumes. Salesforce's standard objects often have built-in optimizations for handling large data volumes and relationships.\n\nWhile both scenarios could potentially impact performance, the complexity and variability of custom object relationships usually present a greater challenge and opportunity for optimization.\""

This would ensure that only the owners of the invoices and their subordinates can see them, and that the invoices inherit the sharing settings of the accounts. A workflow that populates the invoice sharing object upon insert is not necessary if the master-detail relationship is used. A lookup relationship between accounts and invoices would not enforce the same level of security and visibility as a master-detail relationship. Hence correct answers are B &amp; D."

It allows you to make targeted changes and customize access permissions efficiently.\n\nSecurity and Visibility: The new profile can be set up to restrict access to the legacy functionality entirely, ensuring that pilot users can only access the new features.\n\nNo Impact on Existing Users: Since the existing Sales Rep profile is not altered, there won't be any impact on other Sales Reps who are not part of the pilot.

All sales reps will not have read access to accounts for all opportunities, as the sharing rules are based on ownership. Sales reps on the same team will not have edit access to the accounts for opportunities owned by their team members, as owner-based sharing rules only grant read or read/write access to child records, not parent records.

        "content": "Profiles and Permission Sets can be used to control the object-level and field-level access for different types of users. For example, sales reps can have read/write access to Account object but not to the segment field, while service reps can have read-only access to Account object and all fields. Role Hierarchy can be used to control the record-level access for users based on their position in the organization. For example, sales managers can access and modify any account of reps reporting to them, while service managers can access and modify any account regardless of ownership. Field-Level Security can be used to override the profiles and permission sets for specific fields on specific records. For example, service managers can edit the segment field on any account, even if their profile does not allow it. Therefore, the answer D is correct and the other options are incorrect3"

However, they cannot create, edit, or delete pricebooks. This setting aligns with the requirement of sales agents having access to products the company sells, allowing them to see the available pricebooks and associated products for quoting and opportunity creation. The limitation on write access ensures that only authorized users can manage and update pricebooks.\nis not a specific OWD option for pricebooks in Salesforce. \"Use\" is a term used to describe the level of access users have to records based on the OWD settings. It is not a standalone OWD option."
