The only reason the opportunity amount would change is if there was a discount applied, they had a coupon, you get the picture. The reason the amount in the report changes is because your company is based in the US, and you use USD as you currency, so any fluctuation in the exchange rate would cause the converted amount to change. The converted amount is what's being reflected in the report.\nExample: Opportunity created for $50,000 EUR with an exchange rate of 1.25 = $44.247.79 USD. Change the exchange rate to 1.00 and the reported amount, and the actual amount, will then both be $50,000. Any future changes will only change the converted amount. The opportunity amount will always remain the same as long as no new items are added. (I hope this helps)"

These options provide flexibility in forecasting based on different aspects of sales opportunities and their related products.\nThe key here is that Customizable Forecasting in Salesforce allows for a more nuanced approach than just using the Opportunity Close Date.

If the search or filter operation takes longer than the time limit, Salesforce cancels the operation and displays a message to the user indicating that the search or filter could not be completed.\n\nThe search timeout limit can be customized by Salesforce administrators to balance system performance and user experience.

Find field. Hover over it and click Spanner.\nWithin Page Layout check the box for \"Required\".\nSave Layout. \nLog in as another non-Admin user, who has Read and Edit access to the object.\nCan see, but not Edit the newly required field.\nCan save the record without issue.\nSo \"Required\" on Page Layout does NOT  override \"Read Only\" at field creation."

The relationship rules are still simple. Every contact needs to be associated with a primary account. This is the account that appears in Account Name and is usually the company the contact is most closely associated with. Any other accounts associated with the contact represent indirect relationships. The Related Contacts list lets you view current and past relationships, and capture unique and custom details about these relationships so you always know who you\u2019re talking to\u2014or who you should be talking to."

There's also a setting in auto response that can be configured to send an email to the customer when the Case = Closed. However, I tried it and it doesn't work. The email that's sent is the same 'Thanks for submitting a ticket' template, even though I setup a new one.
