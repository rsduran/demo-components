You can use this feature to create **Territory Assignment Rules** that can be used to assign work orders to specific territories based on criteria such as the type of work, the location of the work, or the skills required for the work. The criteria here is the Polygon which is nothing but a child territory. So, I think the answer should be **A** because the territory under the selected polygon should be prioritised. There is no default policy called Polygon assignment policy in SFS so C and D are surely not the correct answer."
