ETL tools are designed to handle complex data migrations, including changes in data models and large volumes of data. They also provide robust error handling and logging capabilities, which are crucial for a successful migration.\n\nB. Write a script to use the Bulk API: Writing a script to use the Bulk API could be a viable option, but it would require significant development effort and may not be feasible given the two-month timeline.

Given the large volume of data generated (100 million records each month) and the need for a 12-month trailing summary, it is advisable to leverage an external data store to handle the data storage and processing. Salesforce Connect allows you to integrate external data with Salesforce seamlessly.\nBy capturing the reward program data in an external data store, such as a separate database or data warehouse, you can efficiently manage and process the large volume of transaction records. Salesforce Connect can be used to establish a real-time connection between Salesforce and the external data store, enabling access to the necessary customer information.\nUsing an external object in Salesforce, which represents the data stored in the external data store, you can surface the 12-month trailing summary of transactions and reward levels within Salesforce. This approach allows customer support agents to view the relevant information without storing the entire transaction history directly in Salesforce."

D makes it sound like the data is bad (and the validation rules previously used don't work) and therefore the data needs to be pre-processed prior to loading. I would select this if they had bad data with no validation rules, but the question doesn't suggest that. It is a best practice to disable apex triggers, workflows, and validation rules when working with LDV, which is what's happening in this case. So it's good that they disabled validation for the load, and to maintain it going forward, they need to re-enable it, which is why I think C works best."

Otherwise, the unit tests would fail while trying to disable them and you'd end up working more on commenting code out/deployment and dealing with that fall out rather than your import. But even disabling validation rules and flows can cause well written unit tests to fail if there are dependencies. \n\nFor this reason, I think it's the answer is D. It's slower, but you'll get the data in without tampering with code. The data can be preprocessed so that validation rules aren't triggered.\n\nRealistically, the answer is a combination of A &amp; D - disable what you can and lower the batch size to accomodate for what you cannot."

Create a skinny table to represent account and contact objects.\n\nSkinny tables can be used to improve the performance of read-only operations in Salesforce. They contain frequently used fields and are kept in sync with their source tables. By reducing the number of joins performed during a query, skinny tables can significantly improve the performance of reports and list views.\n\nNot C. Add custom indexes on frequently searched account and contact objects fields: While adding custom indexes can improve the performance of certain types of queries, it may not have a significant impact on the performance of reports and list views. Additionally, maintaining custom indexes can add complexity and overhead."
