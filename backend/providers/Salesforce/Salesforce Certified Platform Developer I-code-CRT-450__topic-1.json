Also declaring a transient variable will make sure its not serialized(JSON.deserialize). But it will still be part of heap. Transient variable has nothing to do with heap, Thus it won't be a correct option.\n\nB)Query and store fields from a related object in a collection when updating related objects\n\nThis feels illogical and overhead to store fields of related object in a collection, and is wrong in my opinion.\n\nC) Remove or set a collection to null after use\n\nThere is garbage collection and heap deallocation. It happens when the block where you have declared the variable ends. If you wanna free up heap before the end of block and you don't have any use of that variable later then it makes sense to make it null and free up some heap. It's correct and good practice to do so if playing with a huge chunk of records\n\nD) Best practice to avoid SOQL for loops"

If heap size is approaching the limit, investigate it and refactor the code.\n\n2. Use the 'Transient' keyword with variables. It is used to declare instance variables that cannot be saved, and shouldn\u2019t be transmitted as part of the view state for a Visualforce page.\n\n3. Use Limit methods. Use heap limits methods in your Apex code to monitor/manage the heap during execution.\n\n4. Reduce heap size during runtime by removing items from the collection as you iterate over it.\n\n5. Use SOQL for loops. To avoid heap size limits, developers should always use a SOQL \"for\" loop to process query results that return many records."

Master-Detail relationship.\n\nA Master-Detail relationship in Salesforce enforces a strict parent-child relationship between two objects. When a parent record is deleted, all associated child records are also deleted automatically. Additionally, a child record can be easily moved to a different parent by changing the value of the Master-Detail field on the child record.\n\nTherefore, a Master-Detail relationship is the most suitable option for the given requirements."

CPU time is calculated for the executing Apex code, and for any processes that are called from this code, such as package code and workflows. CPU time is private for a transaction and is isolated from other transactions. Operations that don't consume application server CPU time aren't counted toward CPU time. For example, the portion of execution time spent in the database for DML, SOQL, and SOSL isn't counted, nor is waiting time for Apex callouts. Application server CPU time spent in DML operations is counted towards the Apex CPU limit, but isn\u2019t expected to be significant. Bulk API and Bulk API 2.0 consume a unique governor limit for CPU time on Salesforce Servers, with a maximum value of 60,000 milliseconds."

While it is common to name custom exceptions with the \"Exception\" suffix, it is not a strict requirement.\n\nOption E, on the other hand, states that a custom exception class can extend other classes besides the Exception class, which is true.

So according to options on the docs, the workflow rule in reality it's configured to fire only on creation.\nThe order of execution, https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers_order_of_execution.htm, gives priority to triggers and then to workflow rules. In this case the first event is a record creation event so the trigger won't run since it's a before update trigger. So, workflow rule runs the first time on creation incrementing the field value to 1. This fires an update event that causes the before trigger to run hence incrementing the field value to 2. The workflow rule though ignores this update event, so the final field value remains 2."

Lookup\n\nA lookup relationship allows one object to link to another object by referencing the ID of the related object. In this scenario, the Line Item object would have a lookup field that references the Order object. By using a lookup relationship, the financial representatives can be granted access to the Order object but not the Line Item object, since they do not have access to the related objects in a lookup relationship. This allows them to see the Order amount without seeing the details of the individual Line Items.\n\nDirect and indirect lookups are not actual relationship types in Salesforce, but rather terms used to describe the depth of relationships between objects. A master-detail relationship is not appropriate in this scenario because a master-detail relationship requires sharing settings to be set at the master level, which would give access to both the Order and Line Item objects to financial representatives."

When a large amount of data needs to be updated at one time, such as all contacts, batch Apex can be used to handle large amounts of data operations. Anonymous Apex can trigger batch processing immediately, which is useful for large and irregular updates.\n\nC. Remove 15,000 inactive accounts in one transaction after deployment\n\nAnonymous Apex is ideal for large-scale data manipulation in special situations, such as deleting a large number of accounts. The anonymous Apex execution method allows developers to perform these operations in a single transaction, ensuring that data changes are completed in one go."
