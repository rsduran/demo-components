Divisions help segment data and roles based on different business units, departments, or geographic regions within your organization.\n\nBy implementing Divisions, you can:\n\n1. **Isolate Data:** Divisions can be used to separate data so that users in one division can only access and view data within their own division. This helps maintain data privacy and security.\n\n2. **Segment Role Hierarchies:** You can set up separate role hierarchies for each division, allowing for greater flexibility in managing roles and access permissions.\n\n3. **Control Access:** Divisions allow you to control who can see and interact with data and records within their respective divisions, simplifying large-scale realignments."
