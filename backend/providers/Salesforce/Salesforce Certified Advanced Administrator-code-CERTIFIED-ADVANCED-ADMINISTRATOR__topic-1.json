Forecast using opportunity splits: Collaborative Forecasting allows sales teams to use opportunity splits to divide credit for a sale among multiple team members. This helps to accurately forecast revenue based on each team member's contributions to the sale.\n\nC. Overlay quota: Collaborative Forecasting allows managers to overlay a quota on top of the forecast, which helps them to identify areas where the team is falling short and take corrective action before the end of the sales period.\n\nE. Select a default forecast currency setting: Collaborative Forecasting allows users to select a default forecast currency setting, which ensures that all forecasts are consistent and can be easily compared across different regions or currencies."

The administrator can create an assignment rule that assigns leads from the APAC region to an external partner queue for review.\n\nAn approval process can be used to get approval from the Sales Director before the lead is transferred to the external partner. The administrator can create an approval process that sends an email to the Sales Director when a lead is assigned to the external partner queue. The Sales Director can then approve or reject the lead transfer, and the lead will either be assigned to the partner or to a sales team based on the outcome.\n\nTherefore, using these two automation tools, the administrator can ensure that leads are assigned to the correct sales team and transferred to the external partner only after the Sales Director's approval."

Web-to-case: This allows for support cases to be submitted via a web form without requiring users to log into the community or Salesforce. Web-to-case can be set up to automatically create a case record in Salesforce from the information submitted in the form.\n\nD. Case feed actions: Case feed actions can be configured to provide community users with the ability to create a new case directly from the case feed, without requiring them to navigate to a separate page. This can improve the user experience and encourage more users to submit cases."

This is because a Lookup relationship allows a many-to-one relationship between two objects, where the Audit object can be linked to an Account record but multiple Audit records can be linked to the same Account record. Also, since the Audit records need to be preserved for 10 years and only accessible by the audit team, a Lookup relationship would provide flexibility in terms of record access and ownership. The audit team could be given access to view and manage the Audit records without necessarily having access to the related Account records."

A Security Token are two options that the administrator should consider to use multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\nAn authentication app such as Google Authenticator or Salesforce Authenticator generates a unique code that the user must enter in addition to their username and password to log in to Salesforce. This provides an additional layer of security beyond just the password.\n\nA security token is another method for implementing MFA in Salesforce. When a user attempts to log in, they must enter their username, password, and a unique security token. The security token is a string of characters that is generated by Salesforce and can be sent to the user via email or text message.\n\nIt's important to note that using a username and password alone is not considered multi-factor authentication, as it only requires one form of identification."

When troubleshooting an issue with a flow, enabling the System log category can be helpful as it provides detailed information about the underlying processes that the flow is interacting with. For example, the System log can provide information about any Apex code that is executed during the flow, any database operations (such as record updates or queries) that are performed, and any platform events that are triggered. By reviewing the debug log, an administrator or developer can identify any errors or issues that may be preventing the flow from functioning correctly and make the necessary adjustments to resolve the problem."

When MFA is enabled, the session security level must be set to \"High Assurance\" to ensure that users are prompted for MFA verification during login. If the session security level is set to a lower level, such as \"Standard,\" users will not be prompted for MFA verification and may not be able to log in.\n\nOption A, changing MFA to High Assurance, may be a possible solution if the session security level is already set to High Assurance, but would not be the best first step in troubleshooting the issue."
