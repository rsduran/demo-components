In this case, the method requires two fields as input: AccountId and ProductId. So the Send JSON Path should include these two fields with their respective values from the Integration Procedure data JSON. The correct syntax to reference the values from the Integration Procedure data JSON is %FieldName%. Therefore, the Send JSON Path should be configured as follows: AccountId: %AccountId%, ProductId: %Details:ProductId%. This will correctly pass the AccountId and ProductId fields to the APEX class method being called by the Remote Action element."

Additionally, by checking the Is Required for Upsert checkbox, the DataRaptor will throw an error if the Account Id field is not provided, preventing the creation of a new record if one doesn't already exist. This ensures that the Account status is updated only if the record already exists."

In the Condition syntax of each Calculation Step, the developer should compare the isCustomer variable directly to the literal true and false values.
