Transactions are created at any time through their various on-premise and cloud-based systems.<br>2. All necessary transactions are replicated to a custom Transaction object in Salesforce. It is updated periodically so it only has a subset of the necessary transactions between updates.<br>3. Middleware supports publish-subscribe interactions and provides RESTful Enterprise APIs that can retrieve transactions from on-premise and cloud-based systems.<br>The company wants to address a usability concern regarding incomplete data displayed on the LWC component.<br>What should the integration architect specify so the LWC will be able to display all the required transactions?",

Outbound Messaging, which will automatically handle error retries to the service:\n\nWhile Outbound Messaging handles automatic retries, it has limitations in terms of customization and error handling. It may not provide the granular control required to ensure exactly-once delivery.\nB. Button press invokes synchronous callout, with user handling retries in case of error:\n\nRelying on a user to handle retries introduces the risk of human error and does not guarantee that the order will be processed exactly once. This approach lacks the automation and reliability required for critical financial transactions.\nD. Trigger makes @future Apex method, with custom error handling process:\n\n@future methods have limitations, such as not being able to chain jobs or manage complex operations as effectively as Queueable Apex. They also do not provide the same level of control and monitoring capabilities."

However, it\u2019s important to note that this isn\u2019t transactional, meaning a Salesforce record that an event publisher creates after publishing might not be committed to the database before the subscriber receives the event message. This could lead to potential issues where the event is processed before the Salesforce record in the trigger is committed to the database. Therefore, in most cases, it\u2019s recommended to use the \u201cPublish After Commit\u201d behavior to ensure that the transaction is completed before the event is published."

When subscribing to the Salesforce Event Bus, using a ReplayID with a value of -1 will only allow you to see new events. This means that any events that were published before the subscription was established will not be seen.\n\nIn the context of the question, where the requirement is to see all stages of order processing within the retention window, using a ReplayID with a value of -2 (as in Option B) would be more appropriate. This is because a ReplayID of -2 allows you to replay all events from the last 72 hours, which would include both old and new events.\n\nHowever, if the requirement was only to see new events from the point of subscription onwards, then Option C would be a correct choice."
