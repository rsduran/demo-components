    "answerDescription": "The security controls and mechanisms that are in place must have a degree of transparency.<br>This enables the user to perform tasks and duties without having to go through extra steps because of the presence of the security controls. Transparency also does not let the user know too much about the controls, which helps prevent him from figuring out how to circumvent them. If the controls are too obvious, an attacker can figure out how to compromise them more easily.<br>Security (more specifically, the implementation of most security controls) has long been a sore point with users who are subject to security controls. Historically, security controls have been very intrusive to users, forcing them to interrupt their work flow and remember arcane codes or processes (like long passwords or access codes), and have generally been seen as an obstacle to getting work done. In recent years, much work has been done to remove that stigma of security controls as a detractor from the work process adding nothing but time and money. When developing access control, the system must be as transparent as possible to the end user. The users should be required to interact with the system as little as possible, and the process around using the control should be engineered so as to involve little effort on the part of the user.<br>For example, requiring a user to swipe an access card through a reader is an effective way to ensure a person is authorized to enter a room. However, implementing a technology (such as RFID) that will automatically scan the badge as the user approaches the door is more transparent to the user and will do less to impede the movement of personnel in a busy area.<br>In another example, asking a user to understand what applications and data sets will be required when requesting a system ID and then specifically requesting access to those resources may allow for a great deal of granularity when provisioning access, but it can hardly be seen as transparent. A more transparent process would be for the access provisioning system to have a role-based structure, where the user would simply specify the role he or she has in the organization and the system would know the specific resources that user needs to access based on that role. This requires less work and interaction on the part of the user and will lead to more accurate and secure access control decisions because access will be based on predefined need, not user preference.<br>When developing and implementing an access control system special care should be taken to ensure that the control is as transparent to the end user as possible and interrupts his work flow as little as possible.<br>The following answers were incorrect:<br>All of the other detractors were incorrect.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>HARRIS, Shon, All-In-One CISSP Certification Exam Guide, 6th edition.

    "answerDescription": "Detective security controls are like a burglar alarm. They detect and report an unauthorized or undesired event (or an attempted undesired event). Detective security controls are invoked after the undesirable event has occurred. Example detective security controls are log monitoring and review, system audit, file integrity checkers, and motion detection.<br>Visual surveillance or recording devices such as closed circuit television are used in conjunction with guards in order to enhance their surveillance ability and to record events for future analysis or prosecution.<br>When events are monitored, it is considered preventative whereas recording of events is considered detective in nature.<br>Below you have explanations of other types of security controls from a nice guide produce by James Purcell (see reference below):<br>Preventive security controls are put into place to prevent intentional or unintentional disclosure, alteration, or destruction (D.A.D.) of sensitive information.  Some example preventive controls follow:<br>Policy  Unauthorized network connections are prohibited.<br>Firewall  Blocks unauthorized network connections.<br>Locked wiring closet  Prevents unauthorized equipment from being physically plugged into a network switch.<br>Notice in the preceding examples that preventive controls crossed administrative, technical, and physical categories discussed previously. The same is true for any of the controls discussed in this section.<br>Corrective security controls are used to respond to and fix a security incident.  Corrective security controls also limit or reduce further damage from an attack.<br>Examples follow:<br>Procedure to clean a virus from an infected system<br>A guard checking and locking a door left unlocked by a careless employee<br>Updating firewall rules to block an attacking IP address<br>Note that in many cases the corrective security control is triggered by a detective security control.<br>Recovery security controls are those controls that put a system back into production after an incident. Most Disaster Recovery activities fall into this category. For example, after a disk failure, data is restored from a backup tape.<br>Directive security controls are the equivalent of administrative controls. Directive controls direct that some action be taken to protect sensitive organizational information. The directive can be in the form of a policy, procedure, or guideline.<br>Deterrent security controls are controls that discourage security violations. For instance, \"Unauthorized Access Prohibited\" signage may deter a trespasser from entering an area. The presence of security cameras might deter an employee from stealing equipment. A policy that states access to servers is monitored could deter unauthorized access.<br>Compensating security controls are controls that provide an alternative to normal controls that cannot be used for some reason. For instance, a certain server cannot have antivirus software installed because it interferes with a critical application. A compensating control would be to increase monitoring of that server or isolate that server on its own network segment.<br>Note that there is a third popular taxonomy developed by NIST and described in NIST Special Publication 800-53, \"Recommended Security Controls for Federal<br>Information Systems.\" NIST categorizes security controls into 3 classes and then further categorizes the controls within the classes into 17 families.  Within each security control family are dozens of specific controls. The NIST taxonomy is not covered on the CISSP exam but is one the CISSP should be aware of if you are employed within the US federal workforce.<br>Source: KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2001, Chapter<br>10: Physical security (page 340).<br>and<br>CISSP Study Guide By Eric Conrad, Seth Misenar, Joshua Feldman, page 50-52 and<br>Security Control Types and Operational Security, James E.

    "answerDescription": "Poor password selection is frequently a major security problem for any system's security. Administrators should obtain and use password-guessing programs frequently to identify those users having easily guessed passwords.<br>Because password-cracking programs are very CPU intensive and can slow the system on which it is running, it is a good idea to transfer the encrypted passwords to a standalone (not networked) workstation. Also, by doing the work on a non-networked machine, any results found will not be accessible by anyone unless they have physical access to that system.<br>Out of the four choice presented above this is the best choice.<br>However, in real life you would have strong password policies that enforce complexity requirements and does not let the user choose a simple or short password that can be easily cracked or guessed.   That would be the best choice if it was one of the choice presented.<br>Another issue with password cracking is one of privacy.  Many password cracking tools can avoid this by only showing the password was cracked and not showing what the password actually is.   It is masking the password being used from the person doing the cracking.<br>Source: National Security Agency, Systems and Network Attack Center (SNAC), The 60 Minute Network Security Guide, February 2002, page 8.",
