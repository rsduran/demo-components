The iSCSI protocol encapsulates SCSI commands and assembles the data in packets for the TCP/IP layer. Packets are sent over the network using a point-to-point connection. Upon arrival, the iSCSI protocol disassembles the packets, separating the SCSI commands so the operating system (OS) will see the storage as if it was a locally connected SCSI device that can be formatted as usual."

Tree structure: A tree structure is typically used in hierarchical file systems and directories, not in object storage systems. Object storage is flat, meaning there isn't a hierarchy of folders and subfolders.\n\nIn the context of object storage systems, objects themselves are typically stored in a flat namespace without inherent hierarchical organization. Here's why:\n\n Unlike traditional file systems that use a hierarchical directory structure (tree structure), object storage systems do not impose directories or folders on objects.\n\nAre designed to scale horizontally across multiple storage nodes. A flat namespace simplifies the management and distribution of objects across these nodes, allowing for efficient scaling and access.\n\n Objects in object storage systems often include metadata (attributes or tags) that describe the object's characteristics or usage. Metadata provides flexibility and additional context without the need for hierarchical organization."

    "answerDescription": "Sensitive data exposure occurs when information is not properly secured through encryption and secure transport mechanisms; it can quickly become an easy and broad method for attackers to compromise information. Web applications must enforce strong encryption and security controls on the application side, but secure methods of communications with browsers or other clients used to access the information are also required. Security misconfiguration occurs when applications and systems are not properly configured for security, often a result of misapplied or inadequate baselines. Insecure direct object references occur when code references aspects of the infrastructure, especially internal or private systems, and an attacker can use that knowledge to glean more information about the infrastructure. Unvalidated redirects and forwards occur when an application has functions to forward users to other sites, and these functions are not properly secured to validate the data and redirect requests, thus allowing spoofing for malware or phishing attacks.",

External redundancy protects against broader risks such as facility-level disasters or regional outages.\n\nImplementation: Internal redundancy typically involves redundant hardware or systems installed within the same data center or building. External redundancy requires duplicate infrastructure in geographically diverse locations, often involving additional costs and logistical considerations."

    "answerDescription": "Many web applications offer redirect or forward pages that send users to different, external sites. If these pages are not properly secured and validated, attackers can use the application to forward users off to sites for phishing or malware attempts. These attempts can often be more successful than direct phishing attempts because users will trust the site or application that sent them there, and they will assume it has been properly validated and approved by the trusted application's owners or operators. Security misconfiguration occurs when applications and systems are not properly configured for security--often a result of misapplied or inadequate baselines. Insecure direct object references occur when code references aspects of the infrastructure, especially internal or private systems, and an attacker can use that knowledge to glean more information about the infrastructure. Sensitive data exposure occurs when an application does not use sufficient encryption and other security controls to protect sensitive application data.",

Let's address the question directly:\n\nWhen is a virtual machine susceptible to attacks while a physical server in the same state would not be?\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. When it is powered off\n\nExplanation:\n\n    Powered-off Virtual Machine (VM): Even when a virtual machine is powered off, its virtual disks and configurations are still stored on the hypervisor's storage system. While access to these resources is typically secured, vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited through administrative interfaces or if snapshots are not properly managed or encrypted.\n\n    Powered-off Physical Server: A powered-off physical server, on the other hand, typically requires physical access to the server hardware to compromise its data or security. Physical security measures such as locked server rooms or cabinets provide significant protection against unauthorized access."

The question doesn't state anything about the cipher used, so we can't assume that a weak cipher would be the biggest concern when protection of encryption keys is critical across ALL encryption ciphers."

And if created remotely, data should be encrypted, and connections secured (VPN) and secure key management practices should be practiced. Now, in the \"Store\" phase which occurs almost concurrently with the \"Create\" phase is where it's immediately important to employ:\nThe use of backup methods on top of security controls to prevent data loss.\nAdditional encryption for data at rest.

The intent of a contract is to provide for a \nlegally binding instrument that governs the acts, expectations, and \nbehaviors between two or more parties.

From practical exp, if it's a monolithic application and IaaS/PaaS then any application change will not require BCDR test as the infra layer or DR would have been the same. SImilarly containers and SaaS app change/update/config change also should not require BCDR test. Regulation change can be valid reason for BCDR test. Somebody commented here about RTO sarcastically but those RPO/RTO changes could be internal rules/policy with BCDR and definitely may require \"next\" DR test to test /confirm the new targets. More regulations can be state or Federal Govt restrictions for e.g. about failover from Govt DC to happen only to other DCs within certain geographical perimeter. Like many other ISC question, language of this question also rather vague. ISC may expect answer for this as Application change but that's not something ideally trigger this."

It is extremely unlikely that the exact same virtual machines and images used in a previous audit would still be in use or even available for a later audit, making the tracking of changes over time extremely difficult, or even impossible. Elasticity refers to the ability to add and remove resources from a system or service to meet current demand, and although it plays a factor in making the tracking of virtual machines very difficult over time, it is not the best answer in this case. Resource pooling pertains to a cloud environment sharing a large amount of resources between different customers and services. Portability refers to the ability to move systems or services easily between different cloud providers.",

Although this type of attack cannot be used to steal data directly because the attacker has no way of seeing the results of the commands, it does open other ways to compromise an application. Missing function-level access control exists where an application only checks for authorization during the initial login process and does not further validate with each function call. Cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker is able to send untrusted data to a user's browser without going through validation processes. An injection attack is where a malicious actor sends commands or other arbitrary data through input and data fields with the intent of having the application or system execute the code as part of its normal processing and queries.",

Without continual checks each time a function is accessed, an attacker could forge requests to access portions of the application where authorization has not been granted. An injection attack is where a malicious actor sends commands or other arbitrary data through input and data fields with the intent of having the application or system execute the code as part of its normal processing and queries. Cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker is able to send untrusted data to a user's browser without going through validation processes. Cross-site request forgery occurs when an attack forces an authenticated user to send forged requests to an application running under their own access and credentials.",

SOX does not pertain to privacy or data regulation specifically.\n\nThe other three options (HIPAA, FISMA, and PCI DSS) are all regulatory systems from the United States federal government. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a law that protects the privacy of individuals' health information. FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act) is a law that establishes a framework for securing federal government information systems. PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards for organizations that handle credit card information."

With the nature of a cloud environment and how it writes data across diverse systems that are shared by others, the process of eDiscovery becomes much more complicated. Administrators cannot pull physical drives or easily isolate which data to capture. They not only have to focus on which data they need to collect, while ensuring they find all of it, but they also have to make sure that other data is not accidently collected and exposed along with it. Measured service is the aspect of a cloud where customers only pay for the services they are actually using, and for the duration of their use. Portability refers to the ease with which an application or service can be moved among different cloud providers.<br>Broad network access refers to the nature of cloud services being accessed via the public Internet, either with or without secure tunneling technologies. None of these concepts would pertain to eDiscovery.",

Firms that develop and operate their own data center space can also build out their resources in a phased and/or modular approach to manage capital deployment. In addition, since the space belongs to the service provider, they can utilize their assets however they please, whether this means leveraging resources for their own IT equipment or leasing space to other companies for a profit.\nLEASING A DATACENTER:\nOn the other hand, leasing from a top-tier provider has its advantages as well. This approach offers a more consistent and predictable cost model and can help providers reduce capital expenditures when compared with building and operating their own facility.\nhttps://wiredre.com/data-center-decisions-building-vs-leasing-data-center-space/"

This can trick an application into exposing data that is not intended or authorized to be exposed, or it can potentially allow an attacker to gain insight into configurations or security controls. Missing function-level access control exists where an application only checks for authorization during the initial login process and does not further validate with each function call. Cross-site request forgery occurs when an attack forces an authenticated user to send forged requests to an application running under their own access and credentials. Cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker is able to send untrusted data to a user's browser without going through validation processes.",

The other options would allow for lower costs during periods of low usage as well as provide the ability to expand services quickly and easily when needed for peak periods. Measured service allows a cloud customer to only use the resources it needs at the time, and resource pooling allows a cloud customer to access resources as needed. On-demand self-service enables the cloud customer to change its provisioned resources on its own, without the need to interact with the staff from the cloud provider.",

This is because digital signatures provide a way to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data during transmission, which is particularly important when data is being sent over an insecure network such as the internet.\n\nDigital signatures work by using cryptography to create a unique \"signature\" of the data that can be verified by the recipient to ensure that the data has not been tampered with or altered during transmission. This helps to prevent unauthorized access, interception, or modification of the data while it is in transit.\n\nIn contrast, digital signatures may not be as necessary for data that is in a \"stored\" state, such as data that is saved on a secure server or database. In this case, other security mechanisms such as access controls, encryption, and backups may be more important for protecting the data."

It can detect problems within a service and invoke compensating systems or functions to keep functionality going. Although redundancy is similar to fault tolerance, it is more focused on having additional copies of systems available, either active or passive, that can take up services if one system goes down.<br>Elasticity pertains to the ability of a system to resize to meet demands, but it is not focused on system failures. Automation, and its role in maintaining large systems with minimal intervention, is not directly related to fault tolerance.",

Although masking refers to the overall approach of covering sensitive data, anonymization is the best answer here because it is more specific to exactly what is being asked.<br>Tokenization involves the replacement of sensitive data with a key value that can be matched back to the real value. However, it is not focused on indirect identifiers or preventing the matching to an individual. Encryption refers to the overall process of protecting data via key pairs and protecting confidentiality.",

This traditionally has led to increased costs for an organization because physical hardware must be purchased and operational but is not used. By using a cloud system, an organization will only pay for systems when they are being used and only for the duration of use, thus eliminating the need for extra hardware and costs. Portability is the ability to easily move services among different cloud providers. Broad network access allows access to users and staff from anywhere and from different clients, and although this would be important for a BCDR situation, it is not the best answer in this case. On-demand self-service allows users to provision services automatically and when needed, and although this too would be important for BCDR situations, it is not the best answer because it does not address costs or the biggest benefits to an organization.",

    "answerDescription": "Cloud environments, regardless of the specific deployment model used, have extensive and robust security controls in place, especially in regard to physical and infrastructure security. A small company can leverage the extensive security controls and monitoring provided by a cloud provider, which they would unlikely ever be able to afford on their own. Moving to a cloud would not result in any gains for development and testing because these areas require the same rigor regardless of where deployment and hosting occur. Regulatory compliance in a cloud would not be a gain for an organization because it would likely result in additional oversight and auditing as well as require the organization to adapt to a new environment.",

Interoperability, or the ability to reuse components for other services or systems, would not be an important factor for BCDR. Reversibility, or the ability to remove all data quickly and completely from a cloud environment, would be important at the end of a disaster, but would not be important during setup and deployment.

This is particularly important for organizations that are considering using cloud services for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) planning and solutions, as it allows them to quickly and easily increase or decrease their use of cloud resources as needed to support their business operations. Elasticity is typically achieved through the use of automation and other technologies that enable cloud services to automatically scale up or down in response to changes in demand. This can help organizations to ensure that they have the right amount of resources available to support their BCDR needs at all times, and can help to reduce costs by avoiding the need to provision more resources than are actually needed."

DLP, or data loss prevention, is a security technology that is designed to prevent sensitive data from being accidentally or intentionally leaked or accessed by unauthorized users. However, one of the key features of cloud computing is portability, which allows organizations to move their data and applications between different cloud environments and even between on-premises systems and the cloud. This makes it difficult for DLP systems to effectively protect data at rest in the cloud, as the data may be constantly moving between different locations and systems. To address this challenge, organizations can use a combination of DLP technologies, data encryption, and other security measures to protect their data in the cloud."

Without data being organized in such a manner, it is extremely difficult for programmatic tools to automatically synthesize and make determinations from it. The overall quantity of data, as well as the number of sources, does not pose an enormous challenge for data discovery programs, other than requiring a longer time to process the data. The language of the data itself should not matter to a program that is designed to process it, as long as the data is well formed and consistent.",

The primary benefit to the customer of using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the transfer of cost of ownership. In a cloud environment, the customer uses and is billed only for what they use as opposed to the full cost of implementation, saving them a significant amount in terms of cost of ownership. While scalability, metered service, and energy and cooling efficiencies are a part of the benefit of a cloud computing environment, they are not the primary benefit or business driver behind Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) adoption."

Whether public cloud, private cloud, local hypervisor, or bare metal, supporting multiple hosting environments allows the application developer or administrator to migrate the application when and as required. This can also be used as a form of contingency and continuity and to ensure the ongoing availability.<br>- Flexibility: Traditionally, platform providers provided features and requirements that they felt suited the client requirements, along with what suited their service offering and positioned them as the provider of choice, with limited options for the customers to move easily. This has changed drastically, with extensibility and flexibility now afforded to meeting the needs and requirements of developer audiences. This has been heavily influenced by open source, which allows relevant plug-ins to be quickly and efficiently introduced into the platform.<br>- Allow choice and reduce lock-in: PaaS learns from previous horror stories and restrictions, proprietary meant red tape, barriers, and restrictions on what developers could do when it came to migration or adding features and components to the platform. Although the requirement to code to specific APIs was made available by the providers, they could run their apps in various environments based on commonality and standard API structures, ensuring a level of consistency and quality for customers and users.<br>- Ability to auto-scale: This enables the application to seamlessly scale up and down as required to accommodate the cyclical demands of users. The platform will allocate resources and assign these to the application as required. This serves as a key driver for any seasonal organizations that experience spikes and drops in usage.",

This is a cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without requiring decryption. It has three types, depending on how the encryption approach is designed: partially homomorphic encryption (PHE), somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). FHE is the type emerging as a solution provided by large service providers and is the target of intense continuous research that currently focuses on using FHE to enable safe big data machine learning. Homomorphic encryption is far from mainstream due to performance challenges, requiring more processing power than most organizations can afford or manage."

Separation of Duties is a preventative control.\nMandatory Vacations: Prevents an operator from having exclusive use of a system.  Periodically, that individual is forced to take a vacation and relegate control of the system to someone else. This policy is a detective control.\nJob rotation: Similar in purpose to mandatory vacations, but with the added benefit of cross-training employees.\nLeast privilege: Allowing users to have only the required access to do their jobs.\nNeed to know: In addition to clearance, users must also have \u201cneed to know\u201d to access classified data.\nDual control: Requiring more than one user to perform a task."
