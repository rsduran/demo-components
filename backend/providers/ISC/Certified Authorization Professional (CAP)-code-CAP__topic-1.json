It is a systematic procedure for evaluating, describing, testing, and authorizing systems prior to or after a system is in operation. The C&amp;A process is used extensively in the U.S. Federal Government. Some C&amp;A processes include FISMA, NIACAP, DIACAP, and DCID 6/3. Certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. Accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals, based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls."

A negative impact risk is defined as a threat, and a positive impact risk is defined as an opportunity. Risk responses for threats should act two reduce the probability or impact, whereas risk response is for opportunities would want to maximize both the probability and impact should such a risk still occur.\n\nWith this in mind the risk register is updated as a result of Quantitative risk analysis in terms of its risk and probability along with the priority of each risk plus any trends that have been observed."
