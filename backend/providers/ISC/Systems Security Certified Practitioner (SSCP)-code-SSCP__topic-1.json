    "answer": "D",
    "answerDescription": "Because the optical unit utilizes a camera and infrared light to create the images, sun light can impact the aperture so it must not be positioned in direct light of any type. Because the subject does not need to have direct contact with the optical reader, direct light can impact the reader.<br>An Iris recognition is a form of biometrics that is based on the uniqueness of a subject's iris. A camera like device records the patterns of the iris creating what is known as Iriscode.<br>It is the unique patterns of the iris that allow it to be one of the most accurate forms of biometric identification of an individual. Unlike other types of biometics, the iris rarely changes over time. Fingerprints can change over time due to scaring and manual labor, voice patterns can change due to a variety of causes, hand geometry can also change as well. But barring surgery or an accident it is not usual for an iris to change. The subject has a high-resoulution image taken of their iris and this is then converted to Iriscode. The current standard for the Iriscode was developed by John Daugman. When the subject attempts to be authenticated an infrared light is used to capture the iris image and this image is then compared to the Iriscode. If there is a match the subject's identity is confirmed. The subject does not need to have direct contact with the optical reader so it is a less invasive means of authentication then retinal scanning would be.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>AIO, 3rd edition, Access Control, p 134.<br>AIO, 4th edition, Access Control, p 182.<br>Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_recognition<br>The following answers are incorrect:<br>concern that the laser beam may cause eye damage. The optical readers do not use laser so, concern that the laser beam may cause eye damage is not an issue. the iris pattern changes as a person grows older.   The question asked about the physical installation of the scanner, so this was not the best answer.   If the question would have been about long term problems then it could have been the best choice.   Recent research has shown that Irises actually do change over time: http://www.nature.com/news/ageing-eyes-hinder-biometric-scans-1.10722 there is a relatively high rate of false accepts. Since the advent of the Iriscode there is a very low rate of false accepts, in fact the algorithm used has never had a false match. This all depends on the quality of the equipment used but because of the uniqueness of the iris even when comparing identical twins, iris patterns are unique.",

    "answerDescription": "A photoelectric sensor does not \"directly\" sense motion there is a narrow beam that won't set off the sensor unless the beam is broken.  Photoelectric sensors, along with dry contact switches, are a type of perimeter intrusion detector.<br>All of the other answers are valid types of motion detectors types.<br>The content below on the different types of sensors is from Wikepedia:<br><br>Indoor Sensors -<br>These types of sensors are designed for indoor use. Outdoor use would not be advised due to false alarm vulnerability and weather durability.Passive infrared detectors<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02070/0003000001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><br><br>Passive Infrared Sensor -<br>The passive infrared detector (PIR) is one of the most common detectors found in household and small business environments because it offers affordable and reliable functionality. The term passive means the detector is able to function without the need to generate and radiate its own energy (unlike ultrasonic and microwave volumetric intrusion detectors that are \"active\" in operation).  PIRs are able to distinguish if an infrared emitting object is present by first learning the ambient temperature of the monitored space and then detecting a change in the temperature caused by the presence of an object.  Using the principle of differentiation, which is a check of presence or nonpresence, PIRs verify if an intruder or object is actually there. Creating individual zones of detection where each zone comprises one or more layers can achieve differentiation.  Between the zones there are areas of no sensitivity (dead zones) that are used by the sensor for comparison.<br><br>Ultrasonic detectors -<br>Using frequencies between 15 kHz and 75 kHz, these active detectors transmit ultrasonic sound waves that are inaudible to humans.  The Doppler shift principle is the underlying method of operation, in which a change in frequency is detected due to object motion.  This is caused when a moving object changes the frequency of sound waves around it.  Two conditions must occur to successfully detect a Doppler shift event:<br>There must be motion of an object either towards or away from the receiver.<br>The motion of the object must cause a change in the ultrasonic frequency to the receiver relative to the transmitting frequency.<br>The ultrasonic detector operates by the transmitter emitting an ultrasonic signal into the area to be protected. The sound waves are reflected by solid objects (such as the surrounding floor, walls and ceiling) and then detected by the receiver. Because ultrasonic waves are transmitted through air, then hard-surfaced objects tend to reflect most of the ultrasonic energy, while soft surfaces tend to absorb most energy.<br>When the surfaces are stationary, the frequency of the waves detected by the receiver will be equal to the transmitted frequency.  However, a change in frequency will occur as a result of the Doppler principle, when a person or object is moving towards or away from the detector. Such an event initiates an alarm signal.  This technology is considered obsolete by many alarm professionals, and is not actively installed.<br><br>Microwave detectors -<br>This device emits microwaves from a transmitter and detects any reflected microwaves or reduction in beam intensity using a receiver.  The transmitter and receiver are usually combined inside a single housing (monostatic) for indoor applications, and separate housings (bistatic) for outdoor applications. To reduce false alarms this type of detector is usually combined with a passive infrared detector or \"Dualtec\" alarm.<br>Microwave detectors respond to a Doppler shift in the frequency of the reflected energy, by a phase shift, or by a sudden reduction of the level of received energy.<br>Any of these effects may indicate motion of an intruder.<br><br>Photo-electric beams -<br>Photoelectric beam systems detect the presence of an intruder by transmitting visible or infrared light beams across an area, where these beams may be obstructed. To improve the detection surface area, the beams are often employed in stacks of two or more.  However, if an intruder is aware of the technology's presence, it can be avoided.  The technology can be an effective long-range detection system, if installed in stacks of three or more where the transmitters and receivers are staggered to create a fence-like barrier. Systems are available for both internal and external applications.  To prevent a clandestine attack using a secondary light source being used to hold the detector in a 'sealed' condition whilst an intruder passes through, most systems use and detect a modulated light source.<br><br>Glass break detectors -<br>The glass break detector may be used for internal perimeter building protection. When glass breaks it generates sound in a wide band of frequencies. These can range from infrasonic, which is below 20 hertz (Hz) and can not be heard by the human ear, through the audio band from 20 Hz to 20 kHz which humans can hear, right up to ultrasonic, which is above 20 kHz and again cannot be heard. Glass break acoustic detectors are mounted in close proximity to the glass panes and listen for sound frequencies associated with glass breaking. Seismic glass break detectors are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.<br>Typically, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer.

    "answerDescription": "Traffic padding is a countermeasure to traffic analysis.<br>Even if perfect cryptographic routines are used, the attacker can gain knowledge of the amount of traffic that was generated. The attacker might not know what<br>Alice and Bob were talking about, but can know that they were talking and how much they talked. In certain circumstances this can be very bad. Consider for example when a military is organising a secret attack against another nation: it may suffice to alert the other nation for them to know merely that there is a lot of secret activity going on.<br>As another example, when encrypting Voice Over IP streams that use variable bit rate encoding, the number of bits per unit of time is not obscured, and this can be exploited to guess spoken phrases.<br>Padding messages is a way to make it harder to do traffic analysis.  Normally, a number of random bits are appended to the end of the message with an indication at the end how much this random data is. The randomness should have a minimum value of 0, a maximum number of N and an even distribution between the two extremes. Note, that increasing 0 does not help, only increasing N helps, though that also means that a lower percentage of the channel will be used to transmit real data. Also note, that since the cryptographic routine is assumed to be uncrackable (otherwise the padding length itself is crackable), it does not help to put the padding anywhere else, e.g. at the beginning, in the middle, or in a sporadic manner.<br>The other answers are all techniques used to do Penetration Testing.<br>References:<br>KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, pages 233, 238. and https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Padding_%28cryptography%29#Traffic_analysis",

    "answer": "Explanation",
    "answerDescription": "Rule-based access control is a type of non-discretionary access control because this access is determined by rules and the subject does not decide what those rules will be, the rules are uniformly applied to ALL of the users or subjects.<br>In general, all access control policies other than DAC are grouped in the category of non-discretionary access control (NDAC).  As the name implies, policies in this category have rules that are not established at the discretion of the user. Non-discretionary policies establish controls that cannot be changed by users, but only through administrative action.<br>Both Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Rule Based Access Control (RuBAC) fall within Non Discretionary Access Control (NDAC).   If it is not DAC or MAC then it is most likely NDAC.<br><br>IT IS NOT ALWAYS BLACK OR WHITE -<br>The different access control models are not totally exclusive of each others.  MAC is making use of Rules to be implemented.  However with MAC you have requirements above and beyond having simple access rules.  The subject would get formal approval from management, the subject must have the proper security clearance, objects must have labels/sensitivity levels attached to them,  subjects must have the proper security clearance.    If all of this is in place then you have<br>MAC.<br>BELOW YOU HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES:<br><br>MAC = Mandatory Access Control -<br>Under a mandatory access control environment, the system or security administrator will define what permissions subjects have on objects.  The administrator does not dictate users access but simply configure the proper level of access as dictated by the Data Owner.<br>The MAC system will look at the Security Clearance of the subject and compare it with the object sensitivity level or classification level.   This is what is called the dominance relationship.<br>The subject must DOMINATE the object sensitivity level.  Which means that the subject must have a security clearance equal or higher than the object he is attempting to access.<br>MAC also introduce the concept of labels.  Every objects will have a label attached to them indicating the classification of the object as well as categories that are used to impose the need to know (NTK) principle.  Even thou a user has a security clearance of Secret it does not mean he would be able to access any Secret documents within the system.  He would be allowed to access only Secret document for which he has a Need To Know, formal approval, and object where the user belong to one of the categories attached to the object.<br>If there is no clearance and no labels then IT IS NOT Mandatory Access Control.<br>Many of the other models can mimic MAC but none of them have labels and a dominance relationship so they are NOT in the MAC category.<br>NISTR-7316 Says:<br>Usually a labeling mechanism and a set of interfaces are used to determine access based on the MAC policy; for example, a user who is running a process at the<br>Secret classification should not be allowed to read a file with a label of Top Secret. This is known as the \"simple security rule,\" or \"no read up.\" Conversely, a user who is running a process with a label of Secret should not be allowed to write to a file with a label of Confidential. This rule is called the \"*-property\" (pronounced<br>\"star property\") or \"no write down.\" The *-property is required to maintain system security in an automated environment. A variation on this rule called the \"strict *- property\" requires that information can be written at, but not above, the subject\u2019s clearance level. Multilevel security models such as the Bell-La Padula<br>Confidentiality and Biba Integrity models are used to formally specify this kind of MAC policy.<br>DAC = Discretionary Access Control<br>DAC is also known as:  Identity Based access control system.<br>The owner of an object is define as the person who created the object.  As such the owner has the discretion to grant access to other users on the network.<br>Access will be granted based solely on the identity of those users.<br>Such system is good for low level of security.  One of the major problem is the fact that a user who has access to someone's else file can further share the file with other users without the knowledge or permission of the owner of the file.   Very quickly this could become the wild wild west as there is no control on the dissimination of the information.<br>RBAC = Role Based Access Control<br>RBAC is a form of Non-Discretionary access control.<br>Role Based access control usually maps directly with the different types of jobs performed by employees within a company.<br>For example there might be 5 security administrator within your company.  Instead of creating each of their profile one by one, you would simply create a role and assign the administrators to the role.  Once an administrator has been assigned to a role, he will IMPLICITLY inherit the permissions of that role.<br>RBAC is great tool for environment where there is a a large rotation of employees on a daily basis such as a very large help desk for example.<br>RBAC or RuBAC =  Rule Based Access Control<br>RuBAC is a form of Non-Discretionary access control.<br>A good example of a Rule Based access control device would be a Firewall.   A single set of rules is imposed to all users attempting to connect through the firewall.<br>NOTE FROM CLEMENT:<br>Lot of people tend to confuse MAC and Rule Based Access Control.<br>Mandatory Access Control must make use of LABELS.  If there is only rules and no label, it cannot be Mandatory Access Control.  This is why they call it Non<br>Discretionary Access control (NDAC).<br>There are even books out there that are WRONG on this subject.  Books are sometimes opiniated and not strictly based on facts.<br>In MAC subjects must have clearance to access sensitive objects.  Objects have labels that contain the classification to indicate the sensitivity of the object and the label also has categories to enforce the need to know.<br>Today the best example of rule based access control would be a firewall.   All rules are imposed globally to any user attempting to connect through the device.<br>This is NOT the case with MAC.<br>I strongly recommend you read carefully the following document:<br>NISTIR-7316 at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/7316/NISTIR-7316.pdf<br>It is one of the best Access Control Study document to prepare for the exam.

These security labels are assigned to both subjects (users or processes) and objects (files, resources), and they define the sensitivity levels or classifications.\n\nIn MAC, access decisions are not left to the discretion of individual users or object owners.

The advantage of a constrained user interface is that it limits potential avenues of attack and system failure by restricting the processing options that are available to the user.<br>On an ATM machine, if a user does not have a checking account with the bank he or she will not be shown the \"Withdraw money from checking\" option.  Likewise, an information system might have an \"Add/Remove Users\" menu option for administrators, but if a normal, non-administrative user logs in he or she will not even see that menu option.

    "answerDescription": "A central authority determines what subjects can have access to certain objects based on the organizational security policy.<br>The key focal point of this question is the 'central authority' that determines access rights.<br>Cecilia one of the quiz user has sent me feedback informing me that NIST defines MAC as:  \"MAC Policy means that Access Control Policy Decisions are made by a CENTRAL AUTHORITY.   Which seems to indicate there could be two good answers to this question.<br>However if you read the NISTR document mentioned in the references below, it is also mentioned that:  MAC is the most mentioned NDAC policy.   So MAC is a form of NDAC policy.<br>Within the same document it is also mentioned:  \"In general, all access control policies other than DAC are grouped in the category of non- discretionary access control (NDAC). As the name implies, policies in this category have rules that are not established at the discretion of the user. Non-discretionary policies establish controls that cannot be changed by users, but only through administrative action.\"<br>Under NDAC you have two choices:<br>Rule Based Access control and Role Base Access Control<br>MAC is implemented using RULES which makes it fall under RBAC which is a form of NDAC.  It is a subset of NDAC.<br>This question is representative of what you can expect on the real exam where you have more than once choice that seems to be right.  However, you have to look closely if one of the choices would be higher level or if one of the choice falls under one of the other choice.  In this case NDAC is a better choice because<br>MAC is falling under NDAC through the use of Rule Based Access Control.<br>The following are incorrect answers:<br><br>MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL -<br>In Mandatory Access Control the labels of the object and the clearance of the subject determines access rights, not a central authority.  Although a central authority (Better known as the Data Owner) assigns the label to the object, the system does the determination of access rights automatically by comparing the<br>Object label with the Subject clearance.  The subject clearance MUST dominate (be equal or higher) than the object being accessed.<br>The need for a MAC mechanism arises when the security policy of a system dictates that:<br>1. Protection decisions must not be decided by the object owner.<br>2. The system must enforce the protection decisions (i.e., the system enforces the security policy over the wishes or intentions of the object owner).<br>Usually a labeling mechanism and a set of interfaces are used to determine access based on the MAC policy; for example, a user who is running a process at the<br>Secret classification should not be allowed to read a file with a label of Top Secret. This is known as the \"simple security rule,\" or \"no read up.\"<br>Conversely, a user who is running a process with a label of Secret should not be allowed to write to a file with a label of Confidential. This rule is called the \"*- property\" (pronounced \"star property\") or \"no write down.\" The *-property is required to maintain system security in an automated environment.<br><br>DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL -<br>In Discretionary Access Control the rights are determined by many different entities, each of the persons who have created files and they are the owner of that file, not one central authority.<br>DAC leaves a certain amount of access control to the discretion of the object's owner or anyone else who is authorized to control the object's access.   For example, it is generally used to limit a user's access to a file; it is the owner of the file who controls other users' accesses to the file. Only those users specified by the owner may have some combination of read, write, execute, and other permissions to the file.<br>DAC policy tends to be very flexible and is widely used in the commercial and government sectors.  However, DAC is known to be inherently weak for two reasons:<br>First, granting read access is transitive; for example, when Ann grants Bob read access to a file, nothing stops Bob from copying the contents of Anns file to an object that Bob controls. Bob may now grant any other user access to the copy of Anns file without Anns knowledge.<br>Second, DAC policy is vulnerable to Trojan horse attacks. Because programs inherit the identity of the invoking user, Bob may, for example, write a program for<br>Ann that, on the surface, performs some useful function, while at the same time destroys the contents of Anns files.  When investigating the problem, the audit files would indicate that Ann destroyed her own files. Thus, formally, the drawbacks of DAC are as follows:<br>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) Information can be copied from one object to another; therefore, there is no real assurance on the flow of information in a system.<br>No restrictions apply to the usage of information when the user has received it.<br>The privileges for accessing objects are decided by the owner of the object, rather than through a system-wide policy that reflects the organizations security requirements.<br>ACLs and owner/group/other access control mechanisms are by far the most common mechanism for implementing DAC policies. Other mechanisms, even though not designed with DAC in mind, may have the capabilities to implement a DAC policy.<br><br>RULE BASED ACCESS CONTROL -<br>In Rule-based Access Control a central authority could in fact determine what subjects can have access when assigning the rules for access. However, the rules actually determine the access and so this is not the most correct answer.<br>RuBAC (as opposed to RBAC, role-based access control) allow users to access systems and information based on pre determined and configured rules. It is important to note that there is no commonly understood definition or formally defined standard for rule-based access control as there is for DAC, MAC, and RBAC.<br>\"Rule-based access\" is a generic term applied to systems that allow some form of organization-defined rules, and therefore rule-based access control encompasses a broad range of systems.  RuBAC may in fact be combined with other models, particularly RBAC or DAC.  A RuBAC system intercepts every access request and compares the rules with the rights of the user to make an access decision. Most of the rule-based access control relies on a security label system, which dynamically composes a set of rules defined by a security policy. Security labels are attached to all objects, including files, directories, and devices.<br>Sometime roles to subjects (based on their attributes) are assigned as well.   RuBAC meets the business needs as well as the technical needs of controlling service access. It allows business rules to be applied to access controlfor example, customers who have overdue balances may be denied service access.  As a mechanism for MAC, rules of RuBAC cannot be changed by users. The rules can be established by any attributes of a system related to the users such as domain, host, protocol, network, or IP addresses. For example, suppose that a user wants to access an object in another network on the other side of a router.<br>The router employs RuBAC with the rule composed by the network addresses, domain, and protocol to decide whether or not the user can be granted access. If employees change their roles within the organization, their existing authentication credentials remain in effect and do not need to be re configured. Using rules in conjunction with roles adds greater flexibility because rules can be applied to people as well as to devices.   Rule-based access control can be combined with role- based access control, such that the role of a user is one of the attributes in rule setting. Some provisions of access control systems have rule- based policy engines in addition to a role-based policy engine and certain implemented dynamic policies [Des03]. For example, suppose that two of the primary types of software users are product engineers and quality engineers. Both groups usually have access to the same data, but they have different roles to perform in relation to the data and the application's function. In addition, individuals within each group have different job responsibilities that may be identified using several types of attributes such as developing programs and testing areas. Thus, the access decisions can be made in real time by a scripted policy that regulates the access between the groups of product engineers and quality engineers, and each individual within these groups. Rules can either replace or complement role-based access control. However, the creation of rules and security policies is also a complex process, so each organization will need to strike the appropriate balance.<br>References used for this question:<br>http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/7316/NISTIR-7316.pdf and<br>AIO v3 p162-167 and OIG (2007) p.186-191<br>also<br>KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Page 33.",

    "answerDescription": "Identification is the act of a user professing an identity to a system, usually in the form of a log-on ID to the system.<br>Identification is nothing more than claiming you are somebody. You identify yourself when you speak to someone on the phone that you dont know, and they ask you who they\u2019re speaking to. When you say, \"I\u2019m Jason.\", you\u2019ve just identified yourself.<br>In the information security world, this is analogous to entering a username. Its not analogous to entering a password. Entering a password is a method for verifying that you are who you identified yourself as.<br>NOTE:  The word \"professing\" used above means:  \"to say that you are, do, or feel something when other people doubt what you say\".   This is exactly what happen when you provide your identifier (identification), you claim to be someone but the system cannot take your word for it, you must further Authenticate to the system to prove who you claim to be.<br>The following are incorrect answers:<br>Authentication: is how one proves that they are who they say they are. When you claim to be Jane Smith by logging into a computer system as \"jsmith\", it\u2019s most likely going to ask you for a password. Youve claimed to be that person by entering the name into the username field (thats the identification part), but now you have to prove that you are really that person.<br>Many systems use a password for this, which is based on \"something you know\", i.e. a secret between you and the system.<br>Another form of authentication is presenting something you have, such as a drivers license, an RSA token, or a smart card.<br>You can also authenticate via something you are. This is the foundation for biometrics. When you do this, you first identify yourself and then submit a thumb print, a retina scan, or another form of bio-based authentication.<br>Once youve successfully authenticated, you have now done two things: youve claimed to be someone, and youve proven that you are that person. The only thing thats left is for the system to determine what youre allowed to do.<br>Authorization: is what takes place after a person has been both identified and authenticated; its the step determines what a person can then do on the system.<br>An example in people terms would be someone knocking on your door at night. You say, \"Who is it?\", and wait for a response. They say, \"It\u2019s John.\" in order to identify themselves. You ask them to back up into the light so you can see them through the peephole. They do so, and you authenticate them based on what they look like (biometric). At that point you decide they can come inside the house.<br>If they had said they were someone you didnt want in your house (identification), and you then verified that it was that person (authentication), the authorization phase would not include access to the inside of the house.<br>Confidentiality: Is one part of the CIA triad.   It prevents sensitive information from reaching the wrong people, while making sure that the right people can in fact get it. A good example is a credit card number while shopping online, the merchant needs it to clear the transaction but you do not want your informaiton exposed over the network,  you would use a secure link such as SSL, TLS, or some tunneling tool to protect the information from prying eyes between point A and point B.<br>Data encryption is a common method of ensuring confidentiality.<br>The other parts of the CIA triad are listed below:<br>Integrity involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle. Data must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure that data cannot be altered by unauthorized people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality). In addition, some means must be in place to detect any changes in data that might occur as a result of non-human-caused events such as an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) or server crash. If an unexpected change occurs, a backup copy must be available to restore the affected data to its correct state.<br>Availability is best ensured by rigorously maintaining all hardware, performing hardware repairs immediately when needed, providing a certain measure of redundancy and failover, providing adequate communications bandwidth and preventing the occurrence of bottlenecks, implementing emergency backup power systems, keeping current with all necessary system upgrades, and guarding against malicious actions such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.<br>Reference used for this question:<br>http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-CIA http://www.danielmiessler.com/blog/security-identification-authentication-and-authorization http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/profess<br>KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Page 36.",

    "answerDescription": "Password Tokens -<br>Tokens are electronic devices or cards that supply a user's password for them. A token system can be used to supply either a static or a dynamic password.<br>There is a big difference between the static and dynamic systems, a static system will normally log a user in but a dynamic system the user will often have to log themselves in.<br>Static Password Tokens:<br>The owner identity is authenticated by the token. This is done by the person who issues the token to the owner (normally the employer). The owner of the token is now authenticated by \"something you have\". The token authenticates the identity of the owner to the information system. An example of this occurring is when an employee swipes his or her smart card over an electronic lock to gain access to a store room.<br>Synchronous Dynamic Password Tokens:<br>This system is a lot more complex then the static token password. The synchronous dynamic password tokens generate new passwords at certain time intervals that are synched with the main system. The password is generated on a small device similar to a pager or a calculator that can often be attached to the user's key ring. Each password is only valid for a certain time period, typing in the wrong password in the wrong time period will invalidate the authentication. The time factor can also be the systems downfall. If a clock on the system or the password token device becomes out of synch, a user can have troubles authenticating themselves to the system.<br>Asynchronous Dynamic Password Tokens:<br>The clock synching problem is eliminated with asynchronous dynamic password tokens. This system works on the same principal as the synchronous one but it does not have a time frame. A lot of big companies use this system especially for employee's who may work from home on the companies VPN (Virtual private<br>Network).<br>Challenge Response Tokens:<br>This is an interesting system. A user will be sent special \"challenge\" strings at either random or timed intervals. The user inputs this challenge string into their token device and the device will respond by generating a challenge response. The user then types this response into the system and if it is correct they are authenticated.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>http://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=security&amp;seqNum=146 and<br>KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Page 37.",

The user presents the token (e.g., enters the password) to the system, and the system verifies whether the presented token matches the one it expects.\n\nSo, the token (password in this case) is used by the user to authenticate themselves to the system. The token doesn't authenticate the user; rather, it is used by the user to authenticate to the system."

    "answerDescription": "Kerberos is a trusted, third party authentication protocol that was developed under Project Athena at MIT.<br>Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.<br>The Internet is an insecure place. Many of the protocols used in the Internet do not provide any security. Tools to \"sniff\" passwords off of the network are in common use by systems crackers. Thus, applications which send an unencrypted password over the network are extremely vulnerable. Worse yet, other client/ server applications rely on the client program to be \"honest\" about the identity of the user who is using it. Other applications rely on the client to restrict its activities to those which it is allowed to do, with no other enforcement by the server.<br>Some sites attempt to use firewalls to solve their network security problems. Unfortunately, firewalls assume that \"the bad guys\" are on the outside, which is often a very bad assumption. Most of the really damaging incidents of computer crime are carried out by insiders. Firewalls also have a significant disadvantage in that they restrict how your users can use the Internet. (After all, firewalls are simply a less extreme example of the dictum that there is nothing more secure then a computer which is not connected to the network --- and powered off!) In many places, these restrictions are simply unrealistic and unacceptable.<br>Kerberos was created by MIT as a solution to these network security problems. The Kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove its identity to a server (and vice versa) across an insecure network connection. After a client and server have used Kerberos to prove their identity, they can also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data integrity as they go about their business.<br>Kerberos is freely available from MIT, under a copyright permission notice very similar to the one used for the BSD operating and X11 Windowing system. MIT provides Kerberos in source form, so that anyone who wishes to use it may look over the code for themselves and assure themselves that the code is trustworthy.<br>In addition, for those who prefer to rely on a professional supported product, Kerberos is available as a product from many different vendors.<br>In summary, Kerberos is a solution to your network security problems. It provides the tools of authentication and strong cryptography over the network to help you secure your information systems across your entire enterprise. We hope you find Kerberos as useful as it has been to us. At MIT, Kerberos has been invaluable to our Information/Technology architecture.<br>KryptoKnight is a Peer to Peer authentication protocol incorporated into the NetSP product from IBM.<br>SESAME is an authentication and access control protocol, that also supports communication confidentiality and integrity.  It provides public key based authentication along with the Kerberos style authentication, that uses symmetric key cryptography.  Sesame supports the Kerberos protocol and adds some security extensions like public key based authentication and an ECMA-style Privilege Attribute Service.  The complete Sesame protocol is a two step process. In the first step, the client successfully authenticates itself to the Authentication Server and obtains a ticket that can be presented to the Privilege Attribute Server.  In the second step, the initiator obtains proof of his access rights in the form of Privilege Attributes Certificate (PAC). The PAC is a specific form of Access Control<br>Certificate as defined in the ECMA-219 document. This document describes the extensions to Kerberos for public key based authentication as adopted in<br>Sesame.<br>SESAME, KryptoKnight, and NetSP never took off and the protocols are no longer commonly used.<br>References:<br>http://www.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/CCS/people/kenh/kerberos-faq.html#whatis and<br>Source: KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Page 40.",

    "answerDescription": "Sesame is an authentication and access control protocol, that also supports communication confidentiality and integrity. It provides public key based authentication along with the Kerberos style authentication, that uses symmetric key cryptography. Sesame supports the Kerberos protocol and adds some security extensions like public key based authentication and an ECMA-style Privilege Attribute Service.<br><br>The users under SESAME can authenticate using either symmetric encryption as in Kerberos or Public Key authentication.  When using Symmetric Key authentication as in Kerberos,  SESAME is also vulnerable to password guessing just like Kerberos would be.   The Symmetric key being used is based on the password used by the user when he logged on the system.  If the user has a simple password it could be guessed or compromise.  Even thou Kerberos or<br>SESAME may be use, there is still a need to have strong password discipline.<br>The Basic Mechanism in Sesame for strong authentication is as follow:<br>The user sends a request for authentication to the Authentication Server as in Kerberos, except that SESAME is making use of public key cryptography for authentication where the client will present his digital certificate and the request will be signed using a digital signature. The signature is communicated to the authentication server through the preauthentication fields. Upon receipt of this request, the authentication server will verifies the certificate, then validate the signature, and if all is fine the AS will issue a ticket granting ticket (TGT) as in Kerberos. This TGT will be use to communicate with the privilage attribute server<br>(PAS) when access to a resource is needed.<br>Users may authenticate using either a public key pair or a conventional (symmetric) key. If public key cryptography is used, public key data is transported in preauthentication data fields to help establish identity.<br>Kerberos uses tickets for authenticating subjects to objects and SESAME uses Privileged Attribute Certificates (PAC), which contain the subjects identity, access capabilities for the object, access time period, and lifetime of the PAC. The PAC is digitally signed so that the object can validate that it came from the trusted authentication server, which is referred to as the privilege attribute server (PAS). The PAS holds a similar role as the KDC within Kerberos. After a user successfully authenticates to the authentication service (AS), he is presented with a token to give to the PAS. The PAS then creates a PAC for the user to present to the resource he is trying to access.<br><br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>http://srg.cs.uiuc.edu/Security/nephilim/Internal/SESAME.txt<br>and<br>KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Page 43.",

Most of the CISSP books use the same acronym for both models but<br>NIST tend to use a lowercase \"u\" in between R and B to differentiate the two models.<br>You can certainly mimic MAC using RBAC but true MAC makes use of Labels which contains the sensitivity of the objects and the categories they belong to.  No labels means MAC is not being used.<br>One of the most fundamental data access control decisions an organization must make is the amount of control it will give system and data owners to specify the level of access users of that data will have. In every organization there is a balancing point between the access controls enforced by organization and system policy and the ability for information owners to determine who can have access based on specific business requirements. The process of translating that balance into a workable access control model can be defined by three general access frameworks:<br><br>Discretionary access control -<br><br>Mandatory access control -<br><br>Nondiscretionary access control -<br>A role-based access control (RBAC) model bases the access control authorizations on the roles (or functions) that the user is assigned within an organization.<br>The determination of what roles have access to a resource can be governed by the owner of the data, as with DACs, or applied based on policy, as with MACs.<br>Access control decisions are based on job function, previously defined and governed by policy, and each role (job function) will have its own access capabilities.<br>Objects associated with a role will inherit privileges assigned to that role. This is also true for groups of users, allowing administrators to simplify access control strategies by assigning users to groups and groups to roles.<br>There are several approaches to RBAC. As with many system controls, there are variations on how they can be applied within a computer system.<br>There are four basic RBAC architectures:<br>1. Non-RBAC: Non-RBAC is simply a user-granted access to data or an application by traditional mapping, such as with ACLs. There are no formal \"roles\" associated with the mappings, other than any identified by the particular user.<br>2. Limited RBAC: Limited RBAC is achieved when users are mapped to roles within a single application rather than through an organization-wide role structure.<br>Users in a limited RBAC system are also able to access non-RBAC-based applications or data. For example, a user may be assigned to multiple roles within several applications and, in addition, have direct access to another application or system independent of his or her assigned role. The key attribute of limited<br>RBAC is that the role for that user is defined within an application and not necessarily based on the users organizational job function.<br>3. Hybrid RBAC: Hybrid RBAC introduces the use of a role that is applied to multiple applications or systems based on a users specific role within the organization. That role is then applied to applications or systems that subscribe to the organization\u2019s role-based model. However, as the term \"hybrid\" suggests, there are instances where the subject may also be assigned to roles defined solely within specific applications, complimenting (or, perhaps, contradicting) the larger, more encompassing organizational role used by other systems.<br>4. Full RBAC: Full RBAC systems are controlled by roles defined by the organizations policy and access control infrastructure and then applied to applications and systems across the enterprise. The applications, systems, and associated data apply permissions based on that enterprise definition, and not one defined by a specific application or system.<br>Be careful not to try to make MAC and DAC opposites of each other -- they are two different access control strategies with RBAC being a third strategy that was defined later to address some of the limitations of MAC and DAC.<br>The other answers are not correct because:<br>Mandatory access control is incorrect because though it is by definition not discretionary, it is not called \"non-discretionary access control.\"  MAC makes use of label to indicate the sensitivity of the object and it also makes use of categories to implement the need to know.<br>Label-based access control is incorrect because this is not a name for a type of access control but simply a bogus detractor.<br>Lattice based access control is not adequate either. A lattice is a series of levels and a subject will be granted an upper and lower bound within the series of levels. These levels could be sensitivity levels or they could be confidentiality levels or they could be integrity levels.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>All in One, third edition, page 165.<br>Ferraiolo, D., Kuhn, D. &amp; Chandramouli, R.

    "answerDescription": "The main difference between memory cards and smart cards is their capacity to process information. A memory card holds information but cannot process information. A smart card holds information and has the necessary hardware and software to actually process that information.<br>A memory card holds a users authentication information, so that this user needs only type in a user ID or PIN and presents the memory card to the system. If the entered information and the stored information match and are approved by an authentication service, the user is successfully authenticated.<br>A common example of a memory card is a swipe card used to provide entry to a building. The user enters a PIN and swipes the memory card through a card reader. If this is the correct combination, the reader flashes green and the individual can open the door and enter the building.<br>Memory cards can also be used with computers, but they require a reader to process the information. The reader adds cost to the process, especially when one is needed for every computer. Additionally, the overhead of PIN and card generation adds additional overhead and complexity to the whole authentication process.<br>However, a memory card provides a more secure authentication method than using only a password because the attacker would need to obtain the card and know the correct PIN.<br>Administrators and management need to weigh the costs and benefits of a memory card implementation as well as the security needs of the organization to determine if it is the right authentication mechanism for their environment.<br>One of the most prevalent weaknesses of memory cards is that data stored on the card are not protected.

    "answerDescription": "The Bell-LaPadula model is a formal model dealing with confidentiality.<br>The BellLaPadula Model (abbreviated BLP) is a state machine model used for enforcing access control in government and military applications.   It was developed by David Elliott Bell and Leonard J. LaPadula, subsequent to strong guidance from Roger R. Schell to formalize the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) multilevel security (MLS) policy.  The model is a formal state transition model of computer security policy that describes a set of access control rules which use security labels on objects and clearances for subjects. Security labels range from the most sensitive (e.g.\"Top Secret\"), down to the least sensitive (e.g.,<br>\"Unclassified\" or \"Public\").<br>The BellLaPadula model focuses on data confidentiality and controlled access to classified information, in contrast to the Biba Integrity Model which describes rules for the protection of data integrity.  In this formal model, the entities in an information system are divided into subjects and objects.<br>The notion of a \"secure state\" is defined, and it is proven that each state transition preserves security by moving from secure state to secure state, thereby inductively proving that the system satisfies the security objectives of the model. The BellLaPadula model is built on the concept of a state machine with a set of allowable states in a computer network system. The transition from one state to another state is defined by transition functions.<br>A system state is defined to be \"secure\" if the only permitted access modes of subjects to objects are in accordance with a security policy. To determine whether a specific access mode is allowed, the clearance of a subject is compared to the classification of the object (more precisely, to the combination of classification and set of compartments, making up the security level) to determine if the subject is authorized for the specific access mode.<br>The clearance/classification scheme is expressed in terms of a lattice. The model defines two mandatory access control (MAC) rules and one discretionary access control (DAC) rule with three security properties:<br>The Simple Security Property - a subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level (no read-up).<br>The -property (read \"star\"-property) - a subject at a given security level must not write to any object at a lower security level (no write-down). The -property is also known as the Confinement property.<br>The Discretionary Security Property - use of an access matrix to specify the discretionary access control.<br>The following are incorrect answers:<br>Accountability is incorrect. Accountability requires that actions be traceable to the user that performed them and is not addressed by the Bell-LaPadula model.<br>Integrity is incorrect. Integrity is addressed in the Biba model rather than Bell-Lapadula.<br>Availability is incorrect. Availability is concerned with assuring that data/services are available to authorized users as specified in service level objectives and is not addressed by the Bell-Lapadula model.<br>References:<br><br>CBK, pp. 325-326 -<br><br>AIO3, pp. 279 - 284 -<br>AIOv4 Security Architecture and Design (pages 333 - 336)<br>AIOv5 Security Architecture and Design (pages 336 - 338)<br>Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell-La_Padula_model",

A password is an example of something you know, thereby something you know and a password does not constitute a two-factor authentication as both are in the same category of factors.<br>A two-factor (strong) authentication relies on two different kinds of authentication factors out of a list of three possible choice: something you know (e.g. a PIN or password), something you have (e.g. a smart card, token, magnetic card), something you are is mostly Biometrics (e.g. a fingerprint)  or something you do (e.g. signature dynamics).<br>TIP FROM CLEMENT:<br>On the real exam you can expect to see synonyms and sometimes sub-categories under the main categories.  People are familiar with Pin, Passphrase,<br>Password as subset of Something you know.<br>However, when people see choices such as Something you do or Something you are they immediately get confused and they do not think of them as subset of<br>Biometrics where you have Biometric implementation based on behavior and physilogical attributes.   So something you do falls under the Something you are category as a subset.<br>Something your do would be signing your name or typing text on your keyboard for example.<br>Strong authentication is simply when you make use of two factors that are within two different categories.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>Shon Harris, CISSP All In One, Fifth Edition, pages 158-159",

    "answerDescription": "Kerberos is a trusted, credential-based, third-party authentication protocol that uses symmetric (secret) key cryptography to provide robust authentication to clients accessing services on a network.<br>Because a client's password is used in the initiation of the Kerberos request for the service protocol, password guessing can be used to impersonate a client.<br>Here is a nice overview of HOW Kerberos is implement as described in RFC 4556:<br>1.  Introduction<br>The Kerberos V5 protocol [RFC4120] involves use of a trusted third party known as the Key Distribution Center (KDC) to negotiate shared session keys between clients and services and provide mutual authentication between them.<br>The corner-stones of Kerberos V5 are the Ticket and the    Authenticator.  A Ticket encapsulates a symmetric key (the ticket session key) in an envelope (a public message) intended for a specific service.  The contents of the Ticket are encrypted with a symmetric key shared between the service principal and the issuing KDC.  The encrypted part of the Ticket contains the client principal name, among other items.  An Authenticator is a record that can be shown to have been recently generated using the ticket session key in the associated Ticket.  The ticket session key is known by the client who requested the ticket.  The contents of the Authenticator are encrypted with the associated ticket session key.  The encrypted part of an Authenticator contains a timestamp and the client principal name, among other items.<br>As shown in Figure 1, below, the Kerberos V5 protocol consists of the following message exchanges between the client and the KDC, and the client and the application service:<br>The Authentication Service (AS) Exchange<br>The client obtains an \"initial\" ticket from the Kerberos authentication server (AS), typically a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).  The AS-REQ message and the AS-<br>REP message are the request and the reply message, respectively, between the client and the AS.<br>The Ticket Granting Service (TGS) Exchange<br>The client subsequently uses the TGT to authenticate and request a service ticket for a particular service, from the Kerberos ticket-granting server (TGS).  The<br>TGS-REQ message and the TGS-REP message are the request and the reply message respectively between the client and the TGS.<br>The Client/Server Authentication Protocol (AP) Exchange<br>The client then makes a request with an AP-REQ message, consisting of a service ticket and an authenticator that certifies the client's possession of the ticket session key.  The server may optionally reply with an AP-REP message.  AP exchanges typically negotiate session-specific symmetric keys.<br>Usually, the AS and TGS are integrated in a single device also known as the KDC.<br>+--------------+<br>+---------&gt;|  KDC         |<br>AS-REQ /   +-------|              |<br>/   /        +--------------+<br>/   /          ^           |<br>/    |AS-REP   /            |<br>|     |        / TGS-REQ     + TGS-REP<br>|     |       /             /<br>|     |      /             /<br>|     |     /   +---------+<br>|     |    /   /<br>|     |   /   /<br>|     |  /   /<br>|     v /   v<br>++-------+------+             +-----------------+<br>|  Client       +------------&gt;|  Application    |<br>|               |    AP-REQ   |  Server         |<br>|               |&lt;------------|                 |<br>+---------------+    AP-REP   +-----------------+<br>Figure 1:  The Message Exchanges in the Kerberos V5 Protocol<br>In the AS exchange, the KDC reply contains the ticket session key, among other items, that is encrypted using a key (the AS reply key) shared between the client and the KDC.  The AS reply key is typically derived from the client's password for human users.  Therefore, for human users, the attack resistance strength of the Kerberos protocol is no stronger than the strength of their passwords.<br>Source: KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2001, Chapter 2:<br>Access control systems (page 40).<br><br>And -<br>HARRIS, Shon, All-In-One CISSP Certification Exam Guide, McGraw-Hill/Osborne, 2002, chapter 4: Access Control (pages 147-151). and http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4556.txt",

    "answer": "A",
    "answerDescription": "An identity-based access control is an example of discretionary access control that is based on an individual's identity.  Identity-based access control (IBAC) is access control based on the identity of the user (typically relayed as a characteristic of the process acting on behalf of that user) where access authorizations to specific objects are assigned based on user identity.<br>Rule Based Access Control (RuBAC) and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) are examples of non-discretionary access controls.<br>Rule-based access control is a type of non-discretionary access control because this access is determined by rules and the subject does not decide what those rules will be, the rules are uniformly applied to ALL of the users or subjects.<br>In general, all access control policies other than DAC are grouped in the category of non-discretionary access control (NDAC).  As the name implies, policies in this category have rules that are not established at the discretion of the user. Non-discretionary policies establish controls that cannot be changed by users, but only through administrative action.<br>Both Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Rule Based Access Control (RuBAC) fall within Non Discretionary Access Control (NDAC).   If it is not DAC or MAC then it is most likely NDAC.<br>BELOW YOU HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES:<br><br>MAC = Mandatory Access Control -<br>Under a mandatory access control environment, the system or security administrator will define what permissions subjects have on objects.  The administrator does not dictate users access but simply configure the proper level of access as dictated by the Data Owner.<br>The MAC system will look at the Security Clearance of the subject and compare it with the object sensitivity level or classification level.   This is what is called the dominance relationship.<br>The subject must DOMINATE the object sensitivity level.  Which means that the subject must have a security clearance equal or higher than the object he is attempting to access.<br>MAC also introduce the concept of labels.  Every objects will have a label attached to them indicating the classification of the object as well as categories that are used to impose the need to know (NTK) principle.  Even thou a user has a security clearance of Secret it does not mean he would be able to access any Secret documents within the system.  He would be allowed to access only Secret document for which he has a Need To Know, formal approval, and object where the user belong to one of the categories attached to the object.<br>If there is no clearance and no labels then IT IS NOT Mandatory Access Control.<br>Many of the other models can mimic MAC but none of them have labels and a dominance relationship so they are NOT in the MAC category.<br>DAC = Discretionary Access Control<br>DAC is also known as:  Identity Based access control system.<br>The owner of an object is define as the person who created the object.  As such the owner has the discretion to grant access to other users on the network.<br>Access will be granted based solely on the identity of those users.<br>Such system is good for low level of security.  One of the major problem is the fact that a user who has access to someone's else file can further share the file with other users without the knowledge or permission of the owner of the file.   Very quickly this could become the wild wild west as there is no control on the dissimination of the information.<br>RBAC = Role Based Access Control<br>RBAC is a form of Non-Discretionary access control.<br>Role Based access control usually maps directly with the different types of jobs performed by employees within a company.<br>For example there might be 5 security administrator within your company.  Instead of creating each of their profile one by one, you would simply create a role and assign the administrators to the role.  Once an administrator has been assigned to a role, he will IMPLICITLY inherit the permissions of that role.<br>RBAC is great tool for environment where there is a a large rotation of employees on a daily basis such as a very large help desk for example.<br>RBAC or RuBAC =  Rule Based Access Control<br>RuBAC is a form of Non-Discretionary access control.<br>A good example of a Rule Based access control device would be a Firewall.   A single set of rules is imposed to all users attempting to connect through the firewall.<br>Source: KRUTZ, Ronald L. &amp; VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Page 33. and<br>NISTIR-7316 at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/7316/NISTIR-7316.pdf and http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Identity-based_access_control",

    "answerDescription": "The most commonly used fence is the chain linked fence and it is the most affordable. The standard is a six-foot high fence with two-inch mesh square openings.<br>The material should consist of nine-gauge vinyl or galvanized metal. Nine-gauge is a typical fence material installed in residential areas.<br>Additionally, it is recommended to place barbed wire strands angled out from the top of the fence at a 45 angle and away from the protected area with three strands running across the top. This will provide for a seven-foot fence. There are several variations of the use of \"top guards\" using V-shaped barbed wire or the use of concertina wire as an enhancement, which has been a replacement for more traditional three strand barbed wire \"top guards.\"<br>The fence should be fastened to ridged metal posts set in concrete every six feet with additional bracing at the corners and gate openings. The bottom of the fence should be stabilized against intruders crawling under by attaching posts along the bottom to keep the fence from being pushed or pulled up from the bottom. If the soil is sandy, the bottom edge of the fence should be installed below ground level.<br>For maximum security design, the use of double fencing with rolls of concertina wire positioned between the two fences is the most effective deterrent and cost- efficient method. In this design, an intruder is required to use an extensive array of ladders and equipment to breach the fences.<br>Most fencing is largely a psychological deterrent and a boundary marker rather than a barrier, because in most cases such fences can be rather easily penetrated unless added security measures are taken to enhance the security of the fence. Sensors attached to the fence to provide electronic monitoring of cutting or scaling the fence can be used.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>Hernandez CISSP, Steven (2012-12-21).

However, among the options provided, **C. 8' high and above with strands of barbed wire** tends to be more effective for maximum security. \n\nA higher fence makes it more challenging for intruders to climb or breach, and the addition of barbed wire provides an extra deterrent against unauthorized access. However, the selection of the fence should also consider other factors like surveillance, lighting, and other security measures for a comprehensive security approach."

    "answer": "B",
    "answerDescription": "The Bell-LaPadula model focuses on data confidentiality and access to classified information, in contrast to the Biba Integrity Model which describes rules for the protection of data integrity.<br>In this formal model, the entities in an information system are divided into subjects and objects.<br>The notion of a \"secure state\" is defined, and it is proven that each state transition preserves security by moving from secure state to secure state, thereby proving that the system satisfies the security objectives of the model.<br>The Bell-LaPadula model is built on the concept of a state machine with a set of allowable states in a system. The transition from one state to another state is defined by transition functions.<br>A system state is defined to be \"secure\" if the only permitted access modes of subjects to objects are in accordance with a security policy.<br>To determine whether a specific access mode is allowed, the clearance of a subject is compared to the classification of the object (more precisely, to the combination of classification and set of compartments, making up the security level) to determine if the subject is authorized for the specific access mode.<br>The clearance/classification scheme is expressed in terms of a lattice. The model defines two mandatory access control (MAC) rules and one discretionary access control (DAC) rule with three security properties:<br>The Simple Security Property - a subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level (no read-up).<br>The property (read \"star\"-property) - a subject at a given security level must not write to any object at a lower security level (no write-down). The property is also known as the Confinement property.<br>The Discretionary Security Property - use an access control matrix to specify the discretionary access control.<br>The transfer of information from a high-sensitivity document to a lower-sensitivity document may happen in the Bell-LaPadula model via the concept of trusted subjects. Trusted Subjects are not restricted by the property.  Untrusted subjects are.<br>Trusted Subjects must be shown to be trustworthy with regard to the security policy. This security model is directed toward access control and is characterized by the phrase: \"no read up, no write down.\" Compare the Biba model, the Clark-Wilson model and the Chinese Wall.<br>With Bell-LaPadula, users can create content only at or above their own security level (i.e. secret researchers can create secret or top-secret files but may not create public files; no write-down). Conversely, users can view content only at or below their own security level (i.e. secret researchers can view public or secret files, but may not view top-secret files; no read-up).<br><br>Strong  Property -<br>The Strong Property is an alternative to the Property in which subjects may write to objects with only a matching security level. Thus, the write-up operation permitted in the usual Property is not present, only a write-to-same level operation. The Strong Property is usually discussed in the context of multilevel database management systems and is motivated by integrity concerns.<br><br>Tranquility principle -<br>The tranquility principle of the Bell-LaPadula model states that the classification of a subject or object does not change while it is being referenced. There are two forms to the tranquility principle: the \"principle of strong tranquility\" states that security levels do not change during the normal operation of the system and the<br>\"principle of weak tranquility\" states that security levels do not change in a way that violates the rules of a given security policy.<br>Another interpretation of the tranquility principles is that they both apply only to the period of time during which an operation involving an object or subject is occurring. That is, the strong tranquility principle means that an object's security level/label will not change during an operation (such as read or write); the weak tranquility principle means that an object's security level/label may change in a way that does not violate the security policy during an operation.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biba_Model<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark-Wilson_model<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewer_and_Nash_model",
