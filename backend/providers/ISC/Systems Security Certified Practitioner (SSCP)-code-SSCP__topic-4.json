    "answer": "A",
    "answerDescription": "Three concepts are used to create a level of fault tolerance and redundancy in transaction processing.<br>They are Electronic vaulting, remote journaling and database shadowing provide redundancy at the transaction level.<br>Electronic vaulting is accomplished by backing up system data over a network. The backup location is usually at a separate geographical location known as the vault site. Vaulting can be used as a mirror or a backup mechanism using the standard incremental or differential backup cycle. Changes to the host system are sent to the vault server in real-time when the backup method is implemented as a mirror. If vaulting updates are recorded in real-time, then it will be necessary to perform regular backups at the off-site location to provide recovery services due to inadvertent or malicious alterations to user or system data.<br>Journaling or Remote Journaling is another technique used by database management systems to provide redundancy for their transactions. When a transaction is completed, the database management system duplicates the journal entry at a remote location. The journal provides sufficient detail for the transaction to be replayed on the remote system. This provides for database recovery in the event that the database becomes corrupted or unavailable.<br>There are also additional redundancy options available within application and database software platforms. For example, database shadowing may be used where a database management system updates records in multiple locations. This technique updates an entire copy of the database at a remote location.<br>Reference used for this question:<br>Hernandez CISSP, Steven (2012-12-21).

    "answer": "B",
    "answerDescription": "Scanning is definitively a very active attack.  The attacker will make use of a scanner to perform the attack, the scanner will send a very large quantity of packets to the target in order to illicit responses that allows the attacker to find information about the operating system, vulnerabilities, misconfiguration and more.  The packets being sent are sometimes attempting to identify if a known vulnerability exist on the remote hosts.<br>A passive attack is usually done in the footprinting phase of an attack.  While doing your passive reconnaissance you never send a single packet to the destination target.  You gather information from public databases such as the DNS servers, public information through search engines, financial information from finance web sites, and technical infomation from mailing list archive or job posting for example.<br>An attack can be active or passive.<br>An \"active attack\" attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.<br>A \"passive attack\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. (E.g., see: wiretapping.)<br>The following are all incorrect answers because they are all passive attacks:<br>Traffic Analysis - Is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication. It can be performed even when the messages are encrypted and cannot be decrypted. In general, the greater the number of messages observed, or even intercepted and stored, the more can be inferred from the traffic. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of military intelligence or counter-intelligence, and is a concern in computer security.<br>Eavesdropping - Eavesdropping is another security risk posed to networks. Because of the way some networks are built, anything that gets sent out is broadcast to everyone. Under normal circumstances, only the computer that the data was meant for will process that information. However, hackers can set up programs on their computers called \"sniffers\" that capture all data being broadcast over the network. By carefully examining the data, hackers can often reconstruct real data that was never meant for them. Some of the most damaging things that get sniffed include passwords and credit card information.<br>In the cryptographic context, Eavesdropping and sniffing data as it passes over a network are considered passive attacks because the attacker is not affecting the protocol, algorithm, key, message, or any parts of the encryption system.  Passive attacks are hard to detect, so in most cases methods are put in place to try to prevent them rather than to detect and stop them. Altering messages, modifying system files, and masquerading as another individual are acts that are considered active attacks because the attacker is actually doing something instead of sitting back and gathering data. Passive attacks are usually used to gain information prior to carrying out an active attack.\"<br>Wiretapping - Wiretapping refers to listening in on electronic communications on telephones, computers, and other devices. Many governments use it as a law enforcement tool, and it is also used in fields like corporate espionage to gain access to privileged information. Depending on where in the world one is, wiretapping may be tightly controlled with laws that are designed to protect privacy rights, or it may be a widely accepted practice with little or no protections for citizens. Several advocacy organizations have been established to help civilians understand these laws in their areas, and to fight illegal wiretapping.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>HARRIS, Shon, All-In-One CISSP Certification Exam Guide, 6th Edition, Cryptography, Page 865 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_%28computing%29 and http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-wiretapping.htm and https://pangea.stanford.edu/computing/resources/network/security/risks.php and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis",

    "answerDescription": "Computer security should be first and foremost cost-effective.<br>As  for  any  organization,  there is a need  to  measure  their  cost-effectiveness,  to  justify  budget  usage  and  provide  supportive  arguments  for  their  next budget  claim.  But  organizations often have difficulties to accurately measure the effectiveness and the cost of  their  information  security  activities.<br>The  classical  financial  approach  for  ROI  calculation  is  not  particularly  appropriate  for measuring  security-related initiatives:  Security is not  generally  an investment that  results in a profit. Security is more about loss prevention. In other terms, when you invest in security, you dont  expect  benefits;  you  expect  to reduce  the  risks  threatening  your  assets.<br>The concept of the  ROI  calculation  applies  to every investment. Security is no exception.  Executive decision-makers want to know the impact security  is having  on  the  bottom  line.  In  order  to  know  how  much  they  should  spend  on security, they need to know  how much is the lack of security costing to the business and what are the most cost-effective solutions.<br>Applied  to  security,  a  Return  On  Security  Investment  (ROSI)  calculation  can  provide quantitative answers to essential financial questions:<br>Is an organization paying too much for its security?<br>What financial impact on productivity could have lack of security?<br>When is the security investment enough?<br>Is this security product/organisation beneficial?<br>The following are other concerns about computer security but not the first and foremost:<br>The costs and benefits of security should be carefully examined in both monetary and non-monetary terms to ensure that the cost of controls does not exceed expected benefits.<br>Security should be appropriate and proportionate to the value of and degree of reliance on the IT systems and to the severity, probability, and extent of potential harm.<br>Requirements for security vary, depending upon the particular IT system. Therefore it does not make sense for computer security to cover all identified risks when the cost of the measures exceeds the value of the systems they are protecting.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>SWANSON, Marianne &amp; GUTTMAN, Barbara, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), NIST Special Publication 800-14, Generally Accepted<br>Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems, September 1996 (page 6). and http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/introduction-to-return-on-security-investment",

This first analysis will provide information such as what attacks were used, what systems and data were accessed by the intruder, what the intruder did after obtaining access and what the intruder is currently doing (if the intrusion has not been contained).<br>The next step is to communicate with relevant parties who need to be made aware of the intrusion in a timely manner so they can fulfil their responsibilities.<br>Step three is concerned with collecting and protecting all information about the compromised systems and causes of the intrusion. It must be carefully collected, labelled, catalogued, and securely stored.<br>Containing the intrusion, where tactical actions are performed to stop the intruder's access, limit the extent of the intrusion, and prevent the intruder from causing further damage, comes next.<br>Since it is more a long-term goal, eliminating all means of intruder access can only be achieved last, by implementing an ongoing security improvement process.<br>Reference used for this question:<br>ALLEN, Julia H., The CERT Guide to System and Network Security Practices, Addison-Wesley, 2001, Chapter 7: Responding to Intrusions (pages 271-289).",

A first backup may be used to re-install the compromised system for further analysis and the second one should be preserved in a secure location to preserve the chain of custody of evidence.<br>Isolate the compromised systems.<br>Search for signs of intrusions on other systems.<br>Examine logs in order to gather more information and better identify other systems to which the intruder might have gained access.<br>Search through logs of compromised systems for information that would reveal the kind of attacks used to gain access.<br>Identify what the intruder did, for example by analyzing various log files, comparing checksums of known, trusted files to those on the compromised machine and by using other intrusion analysis tools.<br>Regardless of the exact steps being followed,  if you wish to prosecute in a court of law it means you MUST capture the evidence as a first step before it could be lost or contaminated.   You always start with the most volatile evidence first.<br>NOTE:<br>I have received feedback saying that some other steps may be done such as Disconnecting the system from the network or shutting down the system.   This is true.    However, those are not choices listed within the 4 choices attached to this question,  you MUST avoid changing the question.    You must stick to the four choices presented and pick which one is the best out of the four presented.<br>In real life, Forensic is not always black or white.  There are many shades of grey.  In real life you would have to consult your system policy (if you have one), get your Computer Incident team involved, and talk to your forensic expert and then decide what is the best course of action.<br>Reference(s) Used for this question:<br>http://www.newyorkcomputerforensics.com/learn/forensics_process.php and<br>ALLEN, Julia H., The CERT Guide to System and Network Security Practices, Addison-Wesley, 2001, Chapter 7: Responding to Intrusions (pages 273-277).",

This involves understanding how the intrusion occurred, the vulnerabilities that were exploited, and the methods employed by the attacker to gain unauthorized access."
