They keep track of the state of connections and allow or deny packets based on the established state.

By grouping multiple servers together, if one server fails, another can seamlessly take over its workload, minimizing downtime and data loss. This is crucial for ensuring high availability of critical applications and services.\n\nD. Load balancing: With multiple servers working together, the workload can be distributed among them, improving overall performance and responsiveness. This is especially beneficial for handling large surges in traffic or resource-intensive tasks."

Failover: Clustering provides failover capabilities, ensuring high availability by automatically redirecting traffic and services to a standby server in case of a failure on the active server.\n\nD. Load balancing: Clustering helps distribute network traffic and workload evenly across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and prevent bottlenecks. This ensures efficient use of server resources and enhances performance."

Should one server fail, the\nsecond in the cluster can continue working with no\ninterruption in service to customers. This is particularly important with database servers. If one fails,\nin a clustered environment the customer\nwill not even know the main database server is down.\nClustering also provides load balancing. This is critical for Web servers in high volume e-commerce\nsituations. Clustering allows the load to be\ndistributed over many computers rather than focused on a single server."
