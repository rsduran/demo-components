    "answer": "The Answer: \"acceptance phase\". Note the question asks about an \"evaluation report\" - which details how the system evaluated, and an \"accreditation statement\"",
    "answerDescription": "which describes the level the system is allowed to operate at. Because those two activities are a part of testing and testing is a part of the acceptance phase, the only answer above that can be correct is \"acceptance phase\".<br>The other answers are not correct because:<br>The \"project initiation and planning phase\" is just the idea phase. Nothing has been developed yet to be evaluated, tested, accredited, etc.<br>The \"system design specification phase\" is essentially where the initiation and planning phase is fleshed out. For example, in the initiation and planning phase, we might decide we want the system to have authentication. In the design specification phase, we decide that that authentication will be accomplished via username/ password. But there is still nothing actually developed at this point to evaluate or accredit.<br>The \"development &amp; documentation phase\" is where the system is created and documented. Part of the documentation includes specific evaluation and accreditation criteria. That is the criteria that will be used to evaluate and accredit the system during the \"acceptance phase\".<br>In other words - you cannot evaluate or accredit a system that has not been created yet. Of the four answers listed, only the acceptance phase is dealing with an existing system. The others deal with planning and creating the system, but the actual system isn't there yet.<br>Reference:<br>Official ISC2 Guide Page: 558 - 559<br>All in One Third Edition page: 832 - 833 (recommended reading)",

This means that the data must be accurate, up-to-date, and free from inconsistencies. It also means that the data must be consistent with external entities, such as other databases or applications that use the data.\n\nExternal consistency is important because it ensures that the data in the database is reliable and can be used by other systems or applications without errors or inconsistencies. For example, if a database contains customer information, the data must be accurate and up-to-date to ensure that other systems or applications that use the data can do so without issues."

    "answerDescription": "Even though Logical access to information by a terminated employee is possible if the ID and password of the terminated employee has not been deleted this is only one part of the termination procedures. If user ID is not disabled or deleted, it could be possible for the employee without physical access to visit the companies networks remotely and gain access to the information.<br>Please note that this can also be seen in a different way: the most important thing to do could also be to inform others of the person's termination, because even if user ID's and passwords are deleted, a terminated individual could simply socially engineer their way back in by calling an individual he/she used to work with and ask them for access. He could intrude on the facility or use other weaknesses to gain access to information after he has been terminated.<br>By notifying the appropriate company staff about the termination, they would in turn intitiate account termination, ask the employee to return company property, and all credentials would be withdrawn for the individual concerned. This answer is more complete than simply disabling account.<br>It seems harsh and cold when this actually takes place , but too many companies have been hurt by vengeful employees who have lashed out at the company when their positions were revoked for one reason or another. If an employee is disgruntled in any way, or the termination is unfriendly, that employees accounts should be disabled right away, and all passwords on all systems changed.<br>For your exam you should know the information below:<br><br>Employee Termination Processes -<br>Employees join and leave organizations every day. The reasons vary widely, due to retirement,reduction in force, layoffs, termination with or without cause, relocation to another city, careeropportunities with other employers, or involuntary transfers. Terminations may be friendly or unfriendly and will need different levels of care as a result.<br><br>Friendly Terminations -<br>Regular termination is when there is little or no evidence or reason to believe that the termination is not agreeable to both the company and the employee. A standard set of procedures, typically maintained by the human resources department, governs the dismissal of the terminated employee to ensure that company property is returned, and all access is removed. These procedures may include exit interviews and return of keys, identification cards, badges, tokens, and cryptographic keys. Other property, such as laptops, cable locks, credit cards, and phone cards, are also collected. The user manager notifies the security department of the termination to ensure that access is revoked for all platforms and facilities. Some facilities choose to immediately delete the accounts, while others choose to disable the accounts for a policy defined period, for example, 30 days, to account for changes or extensions in the final termination date. The termination process should include a conversation with the departing associate about their continued responsibility for confidentiality of information.<br><br>Unfriendly Terminations -<br>Unfriendly terminations may occur when the individual is fired, involuntarily transferred, laid off,or when the organization has reason to believe that the individual has the means and intention to potentially cause harm to the system. Individuals with technical skills and higher levels of access, such as the systems administrators, computer programmers, database administrators, or any individual with elevated privileges, may present higher risk to the environment. These individuals could alter files, plant logic bombs to create system file damage at a future date, or remove sensitive information. Other disgruntled users could enter erroneous data into the system that may not be discovered for several months. In these situations, immediate termination of systems access is warranted at the time of termination or prior to notifying the employee of the termination. Managing the people aspect of security, from pre-employment to postemployment, is critical to ensure that trustworthy, competent resources are employed to further the business objectives that will protect company information. Each of these actions contributes to preventive, detective, or corrective personnel controls.<br>The following answers are incorrect:<br>The other options are less important.<br>Following reference(s) were/was used to create this question:<br>CISA review manual 2014 Page number 99<br>Harris, Shon (2012-10-18).

    "answerDescription": "DSS emphasizes flexibility in the decision-making approach of users. It is aimed at solving less structured problems, combines the use of models and analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions and supports semi-structured decision-making tasks.<br>DSS is sometimes referred to as the Delphi Method or Delphi Technique:<br>The Delphi technique is a group decision method used to ensure that each member gives an honest opinion of what he or she thinks the result of a particular threat will be. This avoids a group of individuals feeling pressured to go along with others thought processes and enables them to participate in an independent and anonymous way. Each member of the group provides his or her opinion of a certain threat and turns it in to the team that is performing the analysis. The results are compiled and distributed to the group members, who then write down their comments anonymously and return them to the analysis group. The comments are compiled and redistributed for more comments until a consensus is formed. This method is used to obtain an agreement on cost, loss values, and probabilities of occurrence without individuals having to agree verbally.<br>Here is the ISC2 book coverage of the subject:<br>One of the methods that uses consensus relative to valuation of information is the consensus/modified Delphi method.  Participants in the valuation exercise are asked to comment anonymously on the task being discussed. This information is collected and disseminated to a participant other than the original author. This participant comments upon the observations of the original author. The information gathered is discussed in a public forum and the best course is agreed upon by the group (consensus).<br>EXAM TIP:<br>The DSS is what some of the books are referring to as the Delphi Method or Delphi Technique. Be familiar with both terms for the purpose of the exam.<br>The other answers are incorrect:<br>'DSS is aimed at solving highly structured problems' is incorrect because it is aimed at solving less structured problems.<br>'DSS supports only structured decision-making tasks' is also incorrect as it supports semi-structured decision-making tasks.<br>'DSS combines the use of models with non-traditional data access and retrieval functions' is also incorrect as it combines the use of models and analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>Harris, Shon (2012-10-25).

    "answer": "Answer: D",
    "answerDescription": "Under the principle of separation of duties, an operator should not be performing data entry. This should be left to data entry personnel.<br>System operators represent a class of users typically found in data center environments where mainframe systems are used. They provide day-to-day operations of the mainframe environment, ensuring that scheduled jobs are running effectively and troubleshooting problems that may arise. They also act as the arms and legs of the mainframe environment, load and unloading tape and results of job print runs. Operators have elevated privileges, but less than those of system administrators. If misused, these privileges may be used to circumvent the systems security policy. As such, use of these privileges should be monitored through audit logs.<br>Some of the privileges and responsibilities assigned to operators include:<br>Implementing the initial program load: This is used to start the operating system. The boot process or initial program load of a system is a critical time for ensuring system security. Interruptions to this process may reduce the integrity of the system or cause the system to crash, precluding its availability.<br>Monitoring execution of the system: Operators respond to various events, to include errors, interruptions, and job completion messages.<br>Volume mounting: This allows the desired application access to the system and its data.<br>Controlling job flow: Operators can initiate, pause, or terminate programs. This may allow an operator to affect the scheduling of jobs. Controlling job flow involves the manipulation of configuration information needed by the system. Operators with the ability to control a job or application can cause output to be altered or diverted, which can threaten the confidentiality.<br>Bypass label processing: This allows the operator to bypass security label information to run foreign tapes (foreign tapes are those from a different data center that would not be using the same label format that the system could run). This privilege should be strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized access.<br>Renaming and relabeling resources: This is sometimes necessary in the mainframe environment to allow programs to properly execute. Use of this privilege should be monitored, as it can allow the unauthorized viewing of sensitive information.<br>Reassignment of ports and lines: Operators are allowed to reassign ports or lines. If misused, reassignment can cause program errors, such as sending sensitive output to an unsecured location. Furthermore, an incidental port may be opened, subjecting the system to an attack through the creation of a new entry point into the system.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>Hernandez CISSP, Steven (2012-12-21).

This approach allows for the early detection of errors or issues in these critical components. As testing progresses to lower-level modules, it's expected that the foundational parts of the system are stable and working correctly. By identifying issues in critical modules early in the testing process, organizations can address these problems before they potentially cascade into more complex issues later on."

Disposal -<br><br>B. System Design Specifications -<br>C. Development and Implementation<br>D. Functional Requirements Definition<br>During the Functional Requirements Definition the project management and systems development teams will conduct a comprehensive analysis of current and possible future functional requirements to ensure that the new system will meet end-user needs. The teams also review the documents from the project initiation phase and make any revisions or updates as needed. For smaller projects, this phase is often subsumed in the project initiation phase. At this point security requirements should be formalized.<br>The Development Life Cycle is a project management tool that can be used to plan, execute, and control a software development project usually called the<br>Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC).<br>The SDLC is a process that includes systems analysts, software engineers, programmers, and end users in the project design and development. Because there is no industry-wide SDLC, an organization can use any one, or a combination of SDLC methods.<br>The SDLC simply provides a framework for the phases of a software development project from defining the functional requirements to implementation. Regardless of the method used, the SDLC outlines the essential phases, which can be shown together or as separate elements. The model chosen should be based on the project.<br>For example, some models work better with long-term, complex projects, while others are more suited for short-term projects. The key element is that a formalized<br>SDLC is utilized.<br>The number of phases can range from three basic phases (concept, design, and implement) on up.<br>The basic phases of SDLC are:<br><br>Project initiation and planning -<br>Functional requirements definition<br><br>System design specifications -<br><br>Development and implementation -<br>Documentation and common program controls<br>Testing and evaluation control, (certification and accreditation)<br>Transition to production (implementation)<br>The system life cycle (SLC) extends beyond the SDLC to include two additional phases:<br>Operations and maintenance support (post-installation)<br>Revisions and system replacement<br><br>System Design Specifications -<br>This phase includes all activities related to designing the system and software. In this phase, the system architecture, system outputs, and system interfaces are designed. Data input, data flow, and output requirements are established and security features are designed, generally based on the overall security architecture for the company.<br><br>Development and Implementation -<br>During this phase, the source code is generated, test scenarios and test cases are developed, unit and integration testing is conducted, and the program and system are documented for maintenance and for turnover to acceptance testing and production. As well as general care for software quality, reliability, and consistency of operation, particular care should be taken to ensure that the code is analyzed to eliminate common vulnerabilities that might lead to security exploits and other risks.<br>Documentation and Common Program Controls<br>These are controls used when editing the data within the program, the types of logging the program should be doing, and how the program versions should be stored. A large number of such controls may be needed, see the reference below for a full list of controls.<br><br>Acceptance -<br>In the acceptance phase, preferably an independent group develops test data and tests the code to ensure that it will function within the organizations environment and that it meets all the functional and security requirements. It is essential that an independent group test the code during all applicable stages of development to prevent a separation of duties issue. The goal of security testing is to ensure that the application meets its security requirements and specifications. The security testing should uncover all design and implementation flaws that would allow a user to violate the software security policy and requirements. To ensure test validity, the application should be tested in an environment that simulates the production environment. This should include a security certification package and any user documentation.<br>Certification and Accreditation (Security Authorization)<br>Certification is the process of evaluating the security stance of the software or system against a predetermined set of security standards or policies. Certification also examines how well the system performs its intended functional requirements. The certification or evaluation document should contain an analysis of the technical and nontechnical security features and countermeasures and the extent to which the software or system meets the security requirements for its mission and operational environment.<br>Transition to Production (Implementation)<br>During this phase, the new system is transitioned from the acceptance phase into the live production environment. Activities during this phase include obtaining security accreditation; training the new users according to the implementation and training schedules; implementing the system, including installation and data conversions; and, if necessary, conducting any parallel operations.<br>Revisions and System Replacement<br>As systems are in production mode, the hardware and software baselines should be subject to periodic evaluations and audits. In some instances, problems with the application may not be defects or flaws, but rather additional functions not currently developed in the application. Any changes to the application must follow the same SDLC and be recorded in a change management system. Revision reviews should include security planning and procedures to avoid future problems.<br>Periodic application audits should be conducted and include documenting security incidents when problems occur. Documenting system failures is a valuable resource for justifying future system enhancements.<br>Below you have the phases used by NIST in it's 800-63 Revision 2 document<br>As noted above, the phases will vary from one document to another one.  For the purpose of the exam use the list provided in the official ISC2 Study book which is presented in short form above.   Refer to the book for a more detailed description of activities at each of the phases of the SDLC.<br><br>However, all references have very similar steps being used.  As mentioned in the official book, it could be as simple as three phases in it's most basic version<br>(concept, design, and implement) or a lot more in more detailed versions of the SDLC.<br>The key thing is to make use of an SDLC.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02070/0031600001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><br>SDLC phases -<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br>NIST SP 800-64 Revision 2 at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-64-Rev2/SP800-64-Revision2.pdf and<br>Schneiter, Andrew (2013-04-15).

This means that if an applet is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the JVM or in the operating system itself, it could potentially gain access to sensitive information or perform malicious actions on the user's machine without any limitations. Option A is not correct as SSL and S-HTTP are not related to Java applets. Option C is not specific to Java applets and applies to any executable downloaded from the internet. Option D is also not correct as Java does provide safety mechanisms for program isolation from the client system, such as the use of a sandbox to limit the applet's access to system resources."

Java does not check the bytecode at runtime or provide other safety mechanisms for program isolation from the client system.\n\nJava applets can pose a security threat because they run in a controlled environment known as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is supposed to provide a sandboxed and secure execution environment. However, if there are vulnerabilities in the JVM or if the Java applet contains malicious code, it can potentially break out of the sandbox and interact with the client system in harmful ways. This could include actions like reading or modifying local files, making network requests to external servers, or other unauthorized operations."
