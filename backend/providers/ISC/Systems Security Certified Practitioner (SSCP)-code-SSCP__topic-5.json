If you use a session key for each message you encrypt, then the brute force attack provides the attacker with only the key for that one message. So, if you are encrypting 10 messages a day, each with a different session key, but it takes me a month to break each session key then I am fighting a loosing battle.<br>The other answers are not correct because:<br>\"The use of good key generators\" is not correct because a brute force key attack will eventually run through all possible combinations of key. Therefore, any key will eventually be broken in this manner given enough time.<br>\"Nothing can defend you against a brute force crypto key attack\" is incorrect, and not the best answer listed. While it is technically true that any key will eventually be broken by a brute force attack, the question remains \"how long will it take?\". In other words, if you encrypt something today but I can't read it for 10,000 years, will you still care? If the key is changed every session does it matter if it can be broken after the session has ended? Of the answers listed here, session keys are<br>\"often considered a good protection against the brute force cryptography attack\" as the question asks.<br>\"Algorithms that are immune to brute force key attacks\" is incorrect because there currently are no such algorithms.<br>References:<br><br>Official ISC2 Guide page: 259 -<br>All in One Third Edition page: 623",

In the Kerberos authentication protocol, time stamps are included in the tickets to ensure that a ticket is only valid for a specific period of time. This prevents an attacker from intercepting a Kerberos ticket and replaying it at a later time because the time stamp will have expired, rendering the ticket invalid. Time-based validity checks are a crucial part of the security mechanisms in Kerberos authentication."

    "answerDescription": "Remember the term Public-Key Certificate is synonymous with Digital Certificate or Identity certificate.<br>The certificate itself provides the binding but it is the certificate authority who will go through the Certificate Practice Statements (CPS) actually validating the bindings and vouch for the identity of the owner of the key within the certificate.<br>As explained in Wikipedia:<br>In cryptography, a public key certificate (also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate) is an electronic document which uses a digital signature to bind together a public key with an identity  information such as the name of a person or an organization, their address, and so forth.  The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual.<br>In a typical public key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the signature will be of a certificate authority (CA).  In a web of trust scheme such as PGP or GPG, the signature is of either the user (a self-signed certificate) or other users (\"endorsements\") by getting people to sign each other keys.  In either case, the signatures on a certificate are attestations by the certificate signer that the identity information and the public key belong together.<br>RFC 2828 defines the certification authority (CA) as:<br>An entity that issues digital certificates (especially X.509 certificates) and vouches for the binding between the data items in a certificate.<br>An authority trusted by one or more users to create and assign certificates.  Optionally, the certification authority may create the user's keys.<br>X509 Certificate users depend on the validity of information provided by a certificate.  Thus, a CA should be someone that certificate users trust, and usually holds an official position created and granted power by a government, a corporation, or some other organization.  A CA is responsible for managing the life cycle of certificates and, depending on the type of certificate and the CPS that applies, may be responsible for the life cycle of key pairs associated with the certificates<br>Source: SHIREY, Robert W., RFC2828: Internet Security Glossary, may 2000. and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate",

It provides a means of verifying that a given public key indeed belongs to the entity claimed in the certificate. Public-key certificates are a fundamental component of public key infrastructure (PKI) systems and play a critical role in secure communication, digital signatures, and identity verification on the internet and in various secure systems."

An attribute certificate\n\nAn attribute certificate is a type of digital certificate that binds a set of descriptive data items (attributes), other than a public key, either directly to a subject's name or to the identifier of another certificate (typically a public-key certificate). Attribute certificates are used in various security and access control contexts to provide additional information about a subject or entity beyond just their public key. These certificates can be used to convey information such as roles, clearances, access rights, or other attributes associated with the subject in a digital certificate-based system."
