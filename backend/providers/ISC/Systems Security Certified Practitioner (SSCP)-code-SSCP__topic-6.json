    "answerDescription": "Connection-oriented protocols such as TCP provides reliability.<br>It is the responsibility of such protocols in the transport layer to ensure every byte is accounted for.  The network layer does not provide reliability.  It only privides the best route to get the traffic to the final destination address.<br>For your exam you should know the information below about OSI model:<br>The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers. The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the International Organization for Standardization<br>(ISO), maintained by the identification ISO/IEC 7498-1.<br>The model groups communication functions into seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of that path. Two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal.<br><br>OSI Model -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02070/0070100001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Image source: http://www.petri.co.il/images/osi_model.JPG<br><br>PHYSICAL LAYER -<br>The physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model, is concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium.<br>It describes the electrical/optical, mechanical, and functional interfaces to the physical medium, and carries the signals for all of the higher layers. It provides:<br>Data encoding: modifies the simple digital signal pattern (1s and 0s) used by the PC to better accommodate the characteristics of the physical medium, and to aid in bit and frame synchronization. It determines:<br>What signal state represents a binary 1<br>How the receiving station knows when a \"bit-time\" starts<br>How the receiving station delimits a frame<br><br><br>DATA LINK LAYER -<br>The data link layer provides error-free transfer of data frames from one node to another over the physical layer, allowing layers above it to assume virtually error- free transmission over the link. To do this, the data link layer provides:<br>Link establishment and termination: establishes and terminates the logical link between two nodes.<br>Frame traffic control: tells the transmitting node to \"back-off\" when no frame buffers are available.<br>Frame sequencing: transmits/receives frames sequentially.<br>Frame acknowledgment: provides/expects frame acknowledgments. Detects and recovers from errors that occur in the physical layer by retransmitting non- acknowledged frames and handling duplicate frame receipt.<br>Frame delimiting: creates and recognizes frame boundaries.<br>Frame error checking: checks received frames for integrity.<br>Media access management: determines when the node \"has the right\" to use the physical medium.<br><br>NETWORK LAYER -<br>The network layer controls the operation of the subnet, deciding which physical path the data should take based on network conditions, priority of service, and other factors. It provides:<br>Routing: routes frames among networks.<br>Subnet traffic control: routers (network layer intermediate systems) can instruct a sending station to \"throttle back\" its frame transmission when the router's buffer fills up.<br>Frame fragmentation: if it determines that a downstream router's maximum transmission unit (MTU) size is less than the frame size, a router can fragment a frame for transmission and re-assembly at the destination station.<br>Logical-physical address mapping: translates logical addresses, or names, into physical addresses.<br>Subnet usage accounting: has accounting functions to keep track of frames forwarded by subnet intermediate systems, to produce billing information.<br><br>Communications Subnet -<br>The network layer software must build headers so that the network layer software residing in the subnet intermediate systems can recognize them and use them to route data to the destination address.<br>This layer relieves the upper layers of the need to know anything about the data transmission and intermediate switching technologies used to connect systems. It establishes, maintains and terminates connections across the intervening communications facility (one or several intermediate systems in the communication subnet).<br>In the network layer and the layers below, peer protocols exist between a node and its immediate neighbor, but the neighbor may be a node through which data is routed, not the destination station. The source and destination stations may be separated by many intermediate systems.<br><br>TRANSPORT LAYER -<br>The transport layer ensures that messages are delivered error-free, in sequence, and with no losses or duplications. It relieves the higher layer protocols from any concern with the transfer of data between them and their peers.<br>The size and complexity of a transport protocol depends on the type of service it can get from the network layer. For a reliable network layer with virtual circuit capability, a minimal transport layer is required. If the network layer is unreliable and/or only supports datagrams, the transport protocol should include extensive error detection and recovery.<br>The transport layer provides:<br>Message segmentation: accepts a message from the (session) layer above it, splits the message into smaller units (if not already small enough), and passes the smaller units down to the network layer. The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.<br>Message acknowledgment: provides reliable end-to-end message delivery with acknowledgments.<br>Message traffic control: tells the transmitting station to \"back-off\" when no message buffers are available.<br>Session multiplexing: multiplexes several message streams, or sessions onto one logical link and keeps track of which messages belong to which sessions<br>(see session layer).<br>Typically, the transport layer can accept relatively large messages, but there are strict message size limits imposed by the network (or lower) layer. Consequently, the transport layer must break up the messages into smaller units, or frames, prepending a header to each frame.<br>The transport layer header information must then include control information, such as message start and message end flags, to enable the transport layer on the other end to recognize message boundaries. In addition, if the lower layers do not maintain sequence, the transport header must contain sequence information to enable the transport layer on the receiving end to get the pieces back together in the right order before handing the received message up to the layer above.<br><br>End-to-end layers -<br>Unlike the lower \"subnet\" layers whose protocol is between immediately adjacent nodes, the transport layer and the layers above are true \"source to destination\" or end-to-end layers, and are not concerned with the details of the underlying communications facility. Transport layer software (and software above it) on the source station carries on a conversation with similar software on the destination station by using message headers and control messages.<br><br>SESSION LAYER -<br>The session layer allows session establishment between processes running on different stations. It provides:<br>Session establishment, maintenance and termination: allows two application processes on different machines to establish, use and terminate a connection, called a session.<br>Session support: performs the functions that allow these processes to communicate over the network, performing security, name recognition, logging, and so on.<br><br>PRESENTATION LAYER -<br>The presentation layer formats the data to be presented to the application layer. It can be viewed as the translator for the network. This layer may translate data from a format used by the application layer into a common format at the sending station, then translate the common format to a format known to the application layer at the receiving station.<br>The presentation layer provides:<br>Character code translation: for example, ASCII to EBCDIC.<br>Data conversion: bit order, CR-CR/LF, integer-floating point, and so on.<br>Data compression: reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.<br>Data encryption: encrypt data for security purposes. For example, password encryption.<br><br>APPLICATION LAYER -<br>The application layer serves as the window for users and application processes to access network services. This layer contains a variety of commonly needed functions:<br>Resource sharing and device redirection<br><br>Remote file access -<br><br>Remote printer access -<br><br>Inter-process communication -<br><br>Network management -<br><br>Directory services -<br>Electronic messaging (such as mail)<br><br>Network virtual terminals -<br>The following were incorrect answers:<br>Application Layer - The application layer serves as the window for users and application processes to access network services.<br>Network layer - The network layer controls the operation of the subnet, deciding which physical path the data should take based on network conditions, priority of service, and other factors.<br>Physical Layer - The physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model, is concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium. It describes the electrical/optical, mechanical, and functional interfaces to the physical medium, and carries the signals for all of the higher layers.<br>The following reference(s) were/was used to create this question:<br>CISA review manual 2014 Page number 260<br>and<br>Official ISC2 guide to CISSP CBK 3rd Edition Page number 287<br>and<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp_protocol",

    "answerDescription": "L2TP is affected by packet header modification and cannot cope with firewalls and network devices that perform NAT.<br>\"PPTP can run only on top of IP networks.\" is correct as PPTP encapsulates datagrams into an IP packet, allowing PPTP to route many network protocols across an IP network.<br>\"PPTP is an encryption protocol and L2TP is not.\" is correct. When using PPTP, the PPP payload is encrypted with Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) using MSCHAP or EAP-TLS.<br>\"L2TP supports AAA servers\" is correct as L2TP supports TACACS+ and RADIUS.<br>NOTE:<br>L2TP does work over NAT. It is possible to use a tunneled mode that wraps every packet into a UDP packet. Port 4500 is used for this purpose.  However this is not true of PPTP and it is not true as well that it works well with all firewalls and NAT devices.<br>References:<br>All in One Third Edition page 545<br>Official Guide to the CISSP Exam page 124-126",

    "answerDescription": "Alternative routing is a method of routing information via an alternate medium such as copper cable or fiber optics. This involves use of different networks, circuits or end points should the normal network be unavailable. Diverse routing routes traffic through split cable facilities or duplicate cable facilities. This can be accomplished with different and/or duplicate cable sheaths. If different cable sheaths are used, the cable may be in the same conduit and therefore subject to the same interruptions as the cable it is backing up. The communication service subscriber can duplicate the facilities by having alternate routes, although the entrance to and from the customer premises may be in the same conduit. The subscriber can obtain diverse routing and alternate routing from the local carrier, including dual entrance facilities. This type of access is time-consuming and costly. Long haul network diversity is a diverse long-distance network utilizing T1 circuits among the major long-distance carriers. It ensures long-distance access should any one carrier experience a network failure. Last mile circuit protection is a redundant combination of local carrier T1s microwave and/or coaxial cable access to the local communications loop. This enables the facility to have access during a local carrier communication disaster. Alternate local carrier routing is also utilized.<br>Source: Information Systems Audit and Control Association, Certified Information Systems Auditor 2002 review manual, chapter 5: Disaster Recovery and<br>Business Continuity (page 259).",

    "answerDescription": "HTTPS is used for secure web transactions and is not commonly replaced by SSH.<br>Users often want to log on to a remote computer. Unfortunately, most early implementations to meet that need were designed for a trusted network. Protocols/ programs, such as TELNET, RSH, and rlogin, transmit unencrypted over the network, which allows traffic to be easily intercepted. Secure shell (SSH) was designed as an alternative to the above insecure protocols and allows users to securely access resources on remote computers over an encrypted tunnel. SSHs services include remote log-on, file transfer, and command execution. It also supports port forwarding, which redirects other protocols through an encrypted SSH tunnel. Many users protect less secure traffic of protocols, such as X Windows and VNC (virtual network computing), by forwarding them through a SSH tunnel.<br>The SSH tunnel protects the integrity of communication, preventing session hijacking and other man-in-the-middle attacks. Another advantage of SSH over its predecessors is that it supports strong authentication. There are several alternatives for SSH clients to authenticate to a SSH server, including passwords and digital certificates. Keep in mind that authenticating with a password is still a significant improvement over the other protocols because the password is transmitted encrypted.<br><br>The following were wrong answers:<br>telnet is an incorrect choice.  SSH is commonly used as an more secure alternative to telnet.  In fact Telnet should not longer be used today. rlogin is and incorrect choice.

    "answerDescription": "Many times when a connection is opened, the firewall will inspect all layers of the packet. While this inspection is scaled back for subsequent packets to improve performance, this is the best of the four answers.<br>When packet filtering is used, a packet arrives at the firewall, and it runs through its ACLs to determine whether this packet should be allowed or denied. If the packet is allowed, it is passed on to the destination host, or to another network device, and the packet filtering device forgets about the packet. This is different from stateful inspection, which remembers and keeps track of what packets went where until each particular connection is closed. A stateful firewall is like a nosy neighbor who gets into peoples business and conversations. She keeps track of the suspicious cars that come into the neighborhood, who is out of town for the week, and the postman who stays a little too long at the neighbor ladys house. This can be annoying until your house is burglarized. Then you and the police will want to talk to the nosy neighbor, because she knows everything going on in the neighborhood and would be the one most likely to know something unusual happened.<br>\"Inspected at only one Open Systems Interconnetion (OSI) layer\" is incorrect. To perform stateful packet inspection, the firewall must consider at least the network and transport layers.<br>\"Decapsulated at all Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers\" is incorrect. The headers are not stripped (\"decapsulated\" if there is such a word) and are passed through in their entirety IF the packet is passed.<br>\"Encapsulated at all Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) layers\" is incorrect. Encapsulation refers to the adding of a layer's header/trailer to the information received from the above level. This is done when the packet is assembled not at the firewall.<br>Reference(s) used for this question:<br><br>CBK, p. 466 -<br>Harris, Shon (2012-10-25).

This method ensures that only one device at a time has the right to transmit data, preventing collisions. In contrast, Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is used in Ethernet networks and allows devices to listen for a clear channel before transmitting data, but it does not prevent collisions. The other options, Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and Polling, are not specifically designed to address collision problems in wired networks. So, the correct answer is D. Token-passing."

TACACS+ can do this because it separates authentication and authorization functions, while RADIUS can\u2019t because it combines them. So RADIUS does not allow to control your users on which commands can be executed on a router and which cannot.\n\nAnother important advantage is that TACACS+ encrypts the entire payload of the TACACS+ packet, which provides secure communication between the Network Access Server (NAS) and the TACACS+ server. RADIUS, on the other hand, encrypts only the password, so intercepting packets can reveal important information."

    "answer": "B",
    "answerDescription": "IPSec can be run in either tunnel mode or transport mode. Each of these modes has its own particular uses and care should be taken to ensure that the correct one is selected for the solution:<br>Tunnel mode is most commonly used between gateways, or at an end-station to a gateway, the gateway acting as a proxy for the hosts behind it.<br>Transport mode is used between end-stations or between an end-station and a gateway, if the gateway is being treated as a hostfor example, an encrypted<br>Telnet session from a workstation to a router, in which the router is the actual destination.<br>As Figure 1 shows, basically transport mode should be used for end-to-end sessions and tunnel mode should be used for everything else. (Refer to the figure for the following discussion.)<br>Figure 1 Tunnel and transport modes in IPSec.<br>Figure 1 displays some examples of when to use tunnel versus transport mode:<br>Tunnel mode is most commonly used to encrypt traffic between secure IPSec gateways, such as between the Cisco router and PIX Firewall (as shown in example A in Figure 1). The IPSec gateways proxy IPSec for the devices behind them, such as Alice's PC and the HR servers in Figure 1. In example A, Alice connects to the HR servers securely through the IPSec tunnel set up between the gateways.<br>Tunnel mode is also used to connect an end-station running IPSec software, such as the Cisco Secure VPN Client, to an IPSec gateway, as shown in example<br>B.<br>In example C, tunnel mode is used to set up an IPSec tunnel between the Cisco router and a server running IPSec software. Note that Cisco IOS software and the PIX Firewall sets tunnel mode as the default IPSec mode.<br>Transport mode is used between end-stations supporting IPSec, or between an end-station and a gateway, if the gateway is being treated as a host. In example<br>D, transport mode is used to set up an encrypted Telnet session from Alice's PC running Cisco Secure VPN Client software to terminate at the PIX Firewall, enabling Alice to remotely configure the PIX Firewall securely.<br><br>AH Tunnel Versus Transport Mode -<br>Figure 2 shows the differences that the IPSec mode makes to AH. In transport mode, AH services protect the external IP header along with the data payload. AH services protect all the fields in the header that don't change in transport. The header goes after the IP header and before the ESP header, if present, and other higher-layer protocols.<br>In tunnel mode, the entire original header is authenticated, a new IP header is built, and the new IP header is protected in the same way as the IP header in transport mode.<br>Figure 2 AH tunnel versus transport mode.<br>AH is incompatible with Network Address Translation (NAT) because NAT changes the source IP address, which breaks the AH header and causes the packets to be rejected by the IPSec peer.<br>ESP Tunnel Versus Transport Mode<br>Figure 3 shows the differences that the IPSec mode makes to ESP. In transport mode, the IP payload is encrypted and the original headers are left intact. The<br>ESP header is inserted after the IP header and before the upper-layer protocol header. The upper-layer protocols are encrypted and authenticated along with the<br>ESP header. ESP doesn't authenticate the IP header itself.<br><br>NOTE -<br>Higher-layer information is not available because it's part of the encrypted payload.<br>When ESP is used in tunnel mode, the original IP header is well protected because the entire original IP datagram is encrypted. With an ESP authentication mechanism, the original IP datagram and the ESP header are included; however, the new IP header is not included in the authentication.<br>When both authentication and encryption are selected, encryption is performed first, before authentication. One reason for this order of processing is that it facilitates rapid detection and rejection of replayed or bogus packets by the receiving node. Prior to decrypting the packet, the receiver can detect the problem and potentially reduce the impact of denial-of-service attacks.<br>Figure 3 ESP tunnel versus transport mode.<br>ESP can also provide packet authentication with an optional field for authentication. Cisco IOS software and the PIX Firewall refer to this service as ESP hashed message authentication code (HMAC). Authentication is calculated after the encryption is done. The current IPSec standard specifies SHA-1 and MD5 as the mandatory HMAC algorithms.<br>The main difference between the authentication provided by ESP and AH is the extent of the coverage. Specifically, ESP doesn't protect any IP header fields unless those fields are encapsulated by ESP (tunnel mode). Figure 4 illustrates the fields protected by ESP HMAC.<br>Figure 4 ESP encryption with a keyed HMAC.<br><br>IPSec Transforms -<br>An IPSec transform specifies a single IPSec security protocol (either AH or ESP) with its corresponding security algorithms and mode. Example transforms include the following:<br>The AH protocol with the HMAC with MD5 authentication algorithm in tunnel mode is used for authentication.<br>The ESP protocol with the triple DES (3DES) encryption algorithm in transport mode is used for confidentiality of data.<br>The ESP protocol with the 56-bit DES encryption algorithm and the HMAC with SHA-1 authentication algorithm in tunnel mode is used for authentication and confidentiality.<br><br>Transform Sets -<br>A transform set is a combination of individual IPSec transforms designed to enact a specific security policy for traffic. During the ISAKMP IPSec security association negotiation that occurs in IKE phase 2 quick mode, the peers agree to use a particular transform set for protecting a particular data flow. Transform sets combine the following IPSec factors:<br>Mechanism for payload authenticationAH transform<br>Mechanism for payload encryptionESP transform<br>IPSec mode (transport versus tunnel)<br>Transform sets equal a combination of an AH transform, plus an ESP transform, plus the IPSec mode (either tunnel or transport mode).<br>This brings us to the end of the second part of this five-part series of articles covering IPSec.

ICMP can also be used to find out which host has been up and running the longest which would indicates which patches are missing on the host if a critical patch required a reboot.<br>ICMP can also be use for DDoS attacks, so you should strictly limit what type of ICMP traffic would be allowed to flow through your firewall.<br>On top of all this, tools such as LOKI could be use as a client-server application to transfer files back and forward between the internat and some of your internal hosts.

IPSec will generate an integrity check value (ICV), which is really the same thing as a MAC value, over a portion of the packet. Remember that the sender and receiver generate their own values. In IPSec, it is called an ICV value. The receiver compares her ICV value with the one sent by the sender.

When the NAT device changes the IP address, it will not affect the receivers ICV value because it does not include the network header when calculating the ICV.<br>Here is a tutorial on IPSEC from the Shon Harris Blog:<br>The Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) protocol suite provides a method of setting up a secure channel for protected data exchange between two devices. The devices that share this secure channel can be two servers, two routers, a workstation and a server, or two gateways between different networks. IPSec is a widely accepted standard for providing network layer protection. It can be more flexible and less expensive than end-to end and link encryption methods.<br>IPSec has strong encryption and authentication methods, and although it can be used to enable tunneled communication between two computers, it is usually employed to establish virtual private networks (VPNs) among networks across the Internet.<br>IPSec is not a strict protocol that dictates the type of algorithm, keys, and authentication method to use. Rather, it is an open, modular framework that provides a lot of flexibility for companies when they choose to use this type of technology. IPSec uses two basic security protocols: Authentication Header (AH) and<br>Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). AH is the authenticating protocol, and ESP is an authenticating and encrypting protocol that uses cryptographic mechanisms to provide source authentication, confidentiality, and message integrity.<br>IPSec can work in one of two modes: transport mode, in which the payload of the message is protected, and tunnel mode, in which the payload and the routing and header information are protected. ESP in transport mode encrypts the actual message information so it cannot be sniffed and uncovered by an unauthorized entity. Tunnel mode provides a higher level of protection by also protecting the header and trailer data an attacker may find useful. Figure 8-26 shows the high- level view of the steps of setting up an IPSec connection.<br>Each device will have at least one security association (SA) for each VPN it uses. The SA, which is critical to the IPSec architecture, is a record of the configurations the device needs to support an IPSec connection. When two devices complete their handshaking process, which means they have agreed upon a long list of parameters they will use to communicate, these data must be recorded and stored somewhere, which is in the SA.<br>The SA can contain the authentication and encryption keys, the agreed-upon algorithms, the key lifetime, and the source IP address. When a device receives a packet via the IPSec protocol, it is the SA that tells the device what to do with the packet. So if device B receives a packet from device C via IPSec, device B will look to the corresponding SA to tell it how to decrypt the packet, how to properly authenticate the source of the packet, which key to use, and how to reply to the message if necessary.<br>SAs are directional, so a device will have one SA for outbound traffic and a different SA for inbound traffic for each individual communication channel. If a device is connecting to three devices, it will have at least six SAs, one for each inbound and outbound connection per remote device. So how can a device keep all of these<br>SAs organized and ensure that the right SA is invoked for the right connection? With the mighty secu rity parameter index (SPI), thats how. Each device has an<br>SPI that keeps track of the different SAs and tells the device which one is appropriate to invoke for the different packets it receives. The SPI value is in the header of an IPSec packet, and the device reads this value to tell it which SA to consult.<br>IPSec can authenticate the sending devices of the packet by using MAC (covered in the earlier section, \"The One-Way Hash\"). The ESP protocol can provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality if the devices are configured for this type of functionality.<br>So if a company just needs to make sure it knows the source of the sender and must be assured of the integrity of the packets, it would choose to use AH. If the company would like to use these services and also have confidentiality, it would use the ESP protocol because it provides encryption functionality. In most cases, the reason ESP is employed is because the company must set up a secure VPN connection.<br>It may seem odd to have two different protocols that provide overlapping functionality. AH provides authentication and integrity, and ESP can provide those two functions and confidentiality. Why even bother with AH then? In most cases, the reason has to do with whether the environment is using network address translation (NAT). IPSec will generate an integrity check value (ICV), which is really the same thing as a MAC value, over a portion of the packet. Remember that the sender and receiver generate their own values. In IPSec, it is called an ICV value. The receiver compares her ICV value with the one sent by the sender. If the values match, the receiver can be assured the packet has not been modified during transmission. If the values are different, the packet has been altered and the receiver discards the packet.<br>The AH protocol calculates this ICV over the data payload, transport, and network headers. If the packet then goes through a NAT device, the NAT device changes the IP address of the packet. That is its job. This means a portion of the data (network header) that was included to calculate the ICV value has now changed, and the receiver will generate an ICV value that is different from the one sent with the packet, which means the packet will be discarded automatically.<br>The ESP protocol follows similar steps, except it does not include the network header portion when calculating its ICV value. When the NAT device changes the IP address, it will not affect the receivers ICV value because it does not include the network header when calculating the ICV.<br>Because IPSec is a framework, it does not dictate which hashing and encryption algorithms are to be used or how keys are to be exchanged between devices.<br>Key management can be handled manually or automated by a key management protocol. The de facto standard for IPSec is to use Internet Key Exchange (IKE), which is a combination of the ISAKMP and OAKLEY protocols. The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) is a key exchange architecture that is independent of the type of keying mechanisms used. Basically, ISAKMP provides the framework of what can be negotiated to set up an IPSec connection (algorithms, protocols, modes, keys). The OAKLEY protocol is the one that carries out the negotiation process. You can think of ISAKMP as providing the playing field (the infrastructure) and OAKLEY as the guy running up and down the playing field (carrying out the steps of the negotiation).<br>IPSec is very complex with all of its components and possible configurations. This complexity is what provides for a great degree of flexibility, because a company has many different configuration choices to achieve just the right level of protection.
