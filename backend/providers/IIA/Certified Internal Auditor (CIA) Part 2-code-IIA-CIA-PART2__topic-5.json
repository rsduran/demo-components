This approach allows the CAE to leverage specialized technical skills on a flexible basis without the long-term costs associated with hiring full-time employees. Strategic sourcing can provide access to high-level expertise when needed, optimize budget efficiency, and still allow for internal staff development by exposing them to external experts and varied audit engagements.\n\nHowever, a hierarchical structure can provide clear lines of authority and responsibility, which can be beneficial for managing larger teams. However, it does not directly impact the availability of technical audit skills or budget efficiency. It can sometimes limit flexibility and agility in sourcing necessary skills."
