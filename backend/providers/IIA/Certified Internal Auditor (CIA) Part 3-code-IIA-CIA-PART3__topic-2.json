I don't see how charging them the market price (arm's length) LOWERS the tariffs. A tariff is a percentage of whatever you sell at any price. So if it's 10% of $100, it's $10 - but if you LOWER the sale price to $50, it's 10% of $50, which is $5, ergo: Decreasing the transfer/sale price will also LOWER/DECREASE the tariffs."

According to that Reference article, the one that answers the question of what BEST describes the auditor's purpose for cleaning/normalizing data (in other words: WHY did the auditor clean/normalize data), it makes sense to say that that \"The auditor cleaned and normalized the data so that the data fields were consistent and could be used for a specific purpose\"."

Once an employee's biometric data is enrolled and associated with their access rights, it becomes challenging to revoke that credential if the employee's access needs to be removed. Unlike other authentication methods, such as a traditional key lock or a card-key system, which can be physically collected or deactivated, biometric data cannot be easily changed or revoked."

The bonuses are external rewards provided by the organization, which fall under the category of extrinsic rewards. Extrinsic rewards are tangible benefits or incentives that are external to the job itself, such as salary, bonuses, promotions, and recognition. In contrast, intrinsic rewards (option A) refer to the internal satisfaction and enjoyment derived from the work itself. Job enrichment (option B) refers to the process of making a job more satisfying and fulfilling by increasing the level of responsibility, autonomy, and challenge. The hierarchy of needs (option D) is a theory proposed by Abraham Maslow, which suggests that individuals are motivated by a series of needs that range from basic physiological needs to self-actualization. While the sales manager's motivation may align with the need for financial security and esteem (which are part of Maslow's hierarchy), the primary motivation described in the scenario is the external reward of high bonuses."

Plus, if you think about it, what risk does it address (as per the original question)? If someone gains access to something that they shouldn't have access to, encryption protects your data so that the hacker still can't see it. Therefore, it addresses an access risk. This COULD entail privacy to a certain extent, but that's specifically only pertaining to the confidentiality of PII, not an all-around extent of accessing anything and everything. Therefore, I think Access Risk makes more sense because it entails anything and everything to do with the risks of people gaining access to ANY data (whether it be PII or other things) but still not being able to do anything with their access because the data is encrypted."

Causes for adverse labor rate variance include hiring of more skilled labor than anticipated in the standard (this should be reflected in a favorable labor efficiency variance). In this scenario, manager had to hire MORE workers to get the job done \u2013 so now he has to pay both the old workers AND the new workers; therefore the labor rate is HIGHER than it should\u2019ve been (and that\u2019s a bad thing). However, because he hired more skilled workers, the job is going to be more efficiently done, so it\u2019s a favorable labor efficiency.

Does anyone agree? please click the like button.\nFor an internal auditor, the most important point to consider with regard to the database version would be option b) Verify whether the database software version is supported by the vendor. While all the options seem relevant, the primary concern for an auditor should be the risk to the organization. If the database software version is not supported by the vendor, it could pose potential security risks and operational challenges. Being unsupported might mean that the software will no longer receive essential updates, including protection against new threats.\n\nOption a) is also significant as using the most recent database software version ensures better functionality and security features. However, it is not critical if the existing version is still supported and secure. Option c) and d) are less critical from an auditor's perspective as they don't directly impact the risks."

If you have the 2011 version of Excel (and not 2020 version) but it works for your organization, then who cares? As far as the information being restricted, that is something that probably should be looked at, but it's all moot if you haven't first verified that the software version you got is actually from the VENDOR. Per Gleim: \"the first task an auditor should perform is to detect if the software version is an illegal copy\". You could have gotten the \"Excel\" software from the internet, but you might've gotten an illegal copy that could contain a virus - or it could be a version that doesn't work good. Also, if you have issues and the software version you have is not supported by the vendor, then who the heck do you go to? So you'd first want to make sure that you actually have the version that is supported by the vendor."

Duplicate testing involves conducting a review of all transaction records to check for any duplicates. This is an effective means of identifying fraudulent activity, such as multiple payments for a single invoice, which could indicate an embezzlement scheme. On the other hand, gap testing, joining different data sources and calculating statistical parameters, although useful for other purposes, would not be as effective for this specific task.\nAnyone agree?"

Any other thoughts?\nThe most effective control in preventing the disclosure of an organization's confidential electronic information would be limited access to information based on employee duties. By restricting access to sensitive information only to employees who require it for their job responsibilities, the risk of unauthorized disclosure is minimized. This can be achieved by implementing proper access control measures, such as role-based access control or user-level permissions.\n\nNondisclosure agreements between the firm and its employees (option A) can help establish legal consequences for disclosing confidential information, but they alone cannot prevent unauthorized access to such information."

Remote wipe is a security feature that allows administrators or device owners to remotely clear data off of a smart device, usually in the event it is lost or stolen. While it restores the device to default settings, locking encrypted data, it does not affect data that has been backed up elsewhere, such as to a desktop or via cloud computing.\n\nIt's important to note that the remote wipe feature is primarily designed to protect data on the actual device. It does not enable the erasure and reformatting of SD cards (option B), which would require additional steps or settings. It also cannot delete data that has been backed up to a desktop (option C) or via cloud services (option D) since those backups exist outside of the control of the device's remote wipe capabilities."

In a flat structure, there are fewer levels of management, which allows for better communication and collaboration between auditors at different levels. Field auditors can receive guidance and mentorship directly from senior auditors, which promotes knowledge sharing and skill development.\nWhile a flat structure may not necessarily result in lower operating and support costs, it does promote a more dynamic and inclusive work environment. The flatter structure eliminates unnecessary hierarchy and allows employees to have a more direct impact on decision-making processes. This can create greater opportunities for advancement and professional growth, as employees have the chance to take on more responsibilities and showcase their abilities. Hence, seems like C is correct. Do you have any other thoughts in mind?"

Input controls are measures put in place to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and validity of the data entered into a system.

This can include format checks, range checks, and reasonableness checks. By implementing strong input controls, an organization can enhance the integrity and reliability of its IT systems and the resulting output.\n\nAnyone agree?"
