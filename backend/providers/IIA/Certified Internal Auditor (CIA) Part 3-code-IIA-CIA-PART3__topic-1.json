Internal audit does monitor the work of the external auditor, but that doesn't happen while you're selecting the external auditor.  It's really not a very good answer it seems like it should also count as \"correct\" because it's nonsense in the context of the question.  But that is something the CAE does do, so I guess that's why they consider C to be a better answer.\n\nBut \"C\" is the correct response because the Board should be evaluating the external auditor and not the CAE.   Also isn't that a conflict of interest for the internal auditor to develop evaluation criteria for the external auditor?  The test never likes it when party A does party B's job."

This is because the internal auditors can assess the controls and performance of the external service provider objectively, without being directly involved in the day-to-day operations.\nC. This statement is not necessarily true. The difficulty of auditing key controls in outsourced business processes can vary depending on factors such as the nature of the process, the level of documentation and transparency provided by the external service provider, and the access granted to the internal auditors.\nD. This statement is not necessarily true. The efficiency and effectiveness of internal controls in outsourced business processes can vary."

In fact, it may actually be easier in some cases because that outsourced company likely SPECIALIZES in the field that the company needs help with, ergo: they do a BETTER job and would be easier to audit. With Answer D, it's the case in point that I just made - they do a better job than your internal folks. For instance, if you hired a limo service to drive your CEO around - they specialize in driving limos, vs. having an employee who's never driven a limo before."
