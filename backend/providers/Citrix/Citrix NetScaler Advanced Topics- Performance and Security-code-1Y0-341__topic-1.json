Create a dynamic content group: Dynamic content groups are designed for content that is frequently updated. This would allow the engineer to cache the stock price data temporarily, serving it quickly to multiple users without repeatedly querying the backend systems, thus improving the performance for this particular content.\n\nD.

Domain Sharding\n\nDomain sharding allows a web page to reference elements from multiple domains, enabling a browser to open additional parallel connections for downloading resources. This technique can be used to improve the time-to-display of a web page that references many elements for download, as browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections to a single domain. By spreading requests across multiple domains, domain sharding can effectively increase the number of concurrent downloads, thus reducing the overall page load time."

If there is a cache hit, the cached response is returned directly to the client without going to the backend server.\n\nRewrite: Any rewrite policies are applied last before the request is sent to the server or the response is sent to the client.
