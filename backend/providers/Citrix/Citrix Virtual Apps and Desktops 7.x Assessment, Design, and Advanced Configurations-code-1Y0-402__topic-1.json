If no local Controllers are available (for example, because the local Controllers cannot accept more VDA registrations or the local Controllers have failed), the VDA will attempt to register with a Controller in the primary zone. In this case, the VDA stays registered in the primary zone, even if a Controller in satellite zone becomes available again. A VDA in a satellite zone will never attempt to register with a Controller in another satellite zone"
