We still have 2 DDCs that are in DR datacenter, that are under glsb domain name primarysta.gslb.domain.com, so the gateway in primary datacenter will just use those as STA.

Because it states 4 sockets, 12 cores with hyperthreading, I believe they mean 4 physical CPU's (and all CPU's have hyperthreading these days) so when they say 12 cores with hyperthreading, they mean 12 cores with hyperthreading \"on\".

A Citrix site in the cloud is also more highly available then on premise. \nNext, the available hardware on premise is nearly full but not completely full so it is still possible to hosts so VDA's on premise to cut down the costs and have VDA's in to places, on premise and in the cloud, this also helps for high availability.\nSo in mine opinion answer A is more logical."

I  recently passed the Exam and came here to clarify on few question for people also that this is dump is not 100 percent as is in exam but 30-40 % . But  If you will understand the concept in these questions you will get through for sure.  Like I prepared with Official syllabus understood all the concept. and didi a mock like with this exam and refreshed my concept where I missed the helped in the exam. Many questions looks exact same but the question is changed. So I  hope this will help you guys. I will check back this question and the number 1 question in this dump, drop me question in this discussion or question number 1. if anyone need help. Good luck Folks."
