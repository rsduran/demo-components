These are placed behind a Cisco ASA 5505 Firewall is configured to block traffic using access control lists. The network address translation (NAT) is also performed on the firewall.<br>The following requirements were captured by the architect during the discussion held as part of the NetScaler security implementation project with the customer\u2019s security team:<br>The NetScaler device:<br>Should monitor the rate of traffic either on a specific virtual entity or on the device. It should be able to mitigate the attacks from a hostile client sending a flood of requests. The NetScaler device should be able to stop the HTTP, TCP, and DNS based requests.<br>Needs to protect backend servers from overloading.<br>Needs to queue all the incoming requests on the virtual server level instead of the service level.<br>Should provide access to resources on the basis of priority.<br>Should provide protection against well-known Windows exploits, virus-infected personal computers, centrally managed automated botnets, compromised webservers, known spammers/hackers, and phishing proxies.<br>Should provide flexibility to enforce the desired level of security check inspections for the requests originating from a specific geolocation database.<br>Should block the traffic based on a pre-determined header length, URL length, and cookie length. The device should ensure that characters such as a single straight quote (*); backslash(\\), and semicolon (;) are either blocked, transformed, or dropped while being sent to the backend server.<br>Which two security features should the architect configure to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
