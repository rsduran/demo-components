It sets a limit on the overall system resources that can be consumed by the policy.\n\nHTTP.REQ.LIMIT(&lt;limit_identifier&gt;): This expression is used to set a limit on the rate of HTTP requests, in this case, DNS requests. The &lt;limit_identifier&gt; is a placeholder that should be replaced with an appropriate identifier specific to the policy.\n\nBy combining these expressions using the \"||\" operator, the policy is configured to apply the rate limit based on both the system-level limit and the rate of DNS requests."
