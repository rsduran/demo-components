Set Workspace control settings to NOT log off a session when users log off from StoreFront.\n\nExplanation: Before enabling the \"Log Off Web Portal When Session is Launched\" feature in WEM transformer settings, the engineer should configure Workspace control settings to ensure that sessions are not automatically logged off when users log off from StoreFront. This configuration allows users' sessions to persist even after they log off from StoreFront, ensuring continuity of their workspace.\n\nApologies for any confusion caused earlier. This configuration (Answer D) ensures that the session remains active even if the user logs off from the StoreFront web portal, which is essential for maintaining user continuity in a Citrix environment."
