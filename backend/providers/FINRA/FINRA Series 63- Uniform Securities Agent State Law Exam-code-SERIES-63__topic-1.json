Mr.<br>Ranger knows that, on average, in these instances the target firm's price spikes. He calls his client and good friend, Mr. Tonto, and tells him of the rumor, suggesting that Tonto might want to buy shares in the target firm. He tells Mr. Tonto that if the rumor isn't true, the target firm's price may not spike at all and may, in fact, decline, and suggests that Mr. Tonto not invest any money he isn't willing to lose. Mr. Ranger knows that his friend likes to gamble, and decided he wouldn't be much of a friend if he didn't inform Tonto of this potential opportunity.<br>Has Mr. L. Ranger violated any laws or engaged in any prohibited practices?<br>",

He has simply informed Mr.<br>Tonto of the rumor and has told him of the risk involved, and he has not lied or misled Mr. Tonto about the investment. He is also well aware of his friend's risk tolerance level, so he is not making an unsuitable recommendation. This is not considered insider trading since there is no way Mr. Ranger can know whether or not the rumor is true. Selection A is not true because there can be violations of laws or practices, even if the agent and client are friends.",

    "answer": "A",
    "answerDescription": "If an investment adviser is mistakenly sent a client's securities, but returns them to the sender within three business days of receipt, he is not deemed to have taken custody of the securities under NASAA Model Rules. Custody is defined by the NASAA as \"holding directly or indirectly, client funds or securities, or having any authority to obtain possession of them.\" Therefore, an investment adviser who has general power of attorney to withdraw a client's funds or securities from a broker-dealer is acting as a custodian, as is an investment adviser who keeps a client's securities in its safety deposit box. If an investment adviser receives a check from a client that is written to a third party, such as a mutual, that check must be forwarded within 24 hours of receipt, or the investment adviser is deemed to be a custodian.",
