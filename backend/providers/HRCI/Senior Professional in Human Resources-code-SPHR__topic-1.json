When employees are stressed, they are more likely to take time off work, which can significantly impact productivity, increase the burden on other employees, and lead to additional costs for the organization in terms of lost workdays and potential temporary staffing. While workplace accidents, turnover, and drug plan costs also contribute to the overall cost of stress, absenteeism is frequently identified as the primary factor."
