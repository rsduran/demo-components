SPC is a method of monitoring and controlling a process to ensure it operates at its full potential. The Center Line in an SPC chart represents the average of the process, while Control Limits are statistical measures that define the upper and lower bounds of acceptability. Using a periodic time frame allows professionals to analyze trends and make necessary adjustments in the process over specified periods of time."
