See the correct explanation below:\n\nA np-chart is useful when the number of units or sample size in each subgroup is constant as interpretation is easier than a p-chart. For data with different subgroup sizes the center line and control limits both vary making interpretation difficult. In this case, you should use a p-chart which has a constant center line but varying control limits."

In other words, for plotting \"Defects\", you should use the u-control-chart if the subgroup size changes or is different from subgroup to subgroup (instead of the c-control-chart). Note that if the subgroup size changes from subgroup to subgroup, the control limits will vary as well, and you will end up with different control-limits for each subgroup on the u-control-chart.\n\nBut do not forget that np-chart and p-chart are used for plotting \"Defectives\", whereas c-chart and u-chart are used for plotting \"Defects\"."

This shows that our current process is working at 1 sigma/standard deviation level. \n\nThe belt needs the process to work at a 5-sigma level instead of 1-sigma. If we multiply the current standard deviation of $120 by 5 (sigma level), we will get a value of $600, which is way over the acceptable average cost of $3800 ($3680 + 600 = $4,280). \n\nThe question is asking the maximum standard deviation per sigma level that this process needs to work at to have a process under control at 5-sigma. To solve the question, we first need to get the difference between the expected average value and the observed average value, which is $3800 - $3680 = $120. Now, we need to divide this difference of $120 with 5 (expected sigma level) to find out the maximum standard deviation per sigma level, which gives us $120 / 5 = $24."

The assumptions of Mood\u2019s median test are that the data from each population is an independent random sample and the population distributions have the same shape."

Reproducibility involves another operator packing or using a different similar machine to pack.\n\nWhile both accuracy and repeatability are important, repeatability tends to be more important than accuracy in many applications. You can have accurate results that are not repeatable and repeatable results that are not accurate. Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the true value, while repeatability is the measurement of the ability to subsequently hit the same target value or result."

In this example they have given us the complete spread of the data (in other words the total variation of the process), and not the standard deviation. The spread of the process is calculated by USL - LSL, also known as the \"tolerance\". Here the total variation range is 18 units, and for a 6-sigma process we have 3-sigma on each side, therefore we will divide 18 by 2 to get the total variance on each side of the mean (mean of 104 units). 18 / 2 = 9. 9 is the total variation of data on each side of the mean.\n\nIf we divide 9 by 3-sigma, we get 3, which means, standard deviation per each sigma-level is 3. In the Cpk formula below we can see that the equation is divided by \"3 x sd\", 3 here is the 3-sigma and the sd is the calculated value of 3. So, 3 x 3 = 9. I hope you get the concept.\n\nCpk Formula = Minimum Of (USL - Mean / 3 x sd, Mean - LSL / 3 x sd)"

Our USL side is working at 6-sigma level (104 Mean + (6Sigma x 3sd) = 122), but our LSL side is working at a sigma level of below 3-sigma (104 Mean - (3Sigma x 3 sd) = 95). Since our LSL side is not at the 3-sigma level, the Cpk calculated was .89. .89 shows that we need to improve our process and reduce the standard deviation.\n\nIf the question had given us the standard deviation instead of the spread of 18, then we would have multiplied 3 with the standard deviation as shown in the Cpk formula, then we would not need to calculate the standard deviation with the help of the spread."

This shows that our process is producing defective units with a value of 95 which is outside the LSL value of 96. Our LSL side is working at a sigma level of less than 3, and the 3rd sigma level is outside the LSL. We need to bring the 3rd sigma level inside the LSL value of 96, ideally, our process should be working at 5-sigma inside the LSL value of 96."

What option \"A\" means is that, if your data is not normally distributed (the bell curve), where data is mostly scattered around the mean value, your cp/cpk or pp/ppk values will be affected (lower than 1.33). You will only get a higher process capability study values ( greater than 1.33) if you have less variation in your process, lesser the variation, the peak or nose of your data distribution is going to be much thinner and longer around the mean. Therefore, the shape of your data distribution will definitely have an effect on your cp/cpk or pp/ppk value. The more your data is spread, the lower process capability values will be calculated."

But your management needs to know the total number of reports to be delivered, the ratio of undelivered report is 10/10 or 10/100 or 10/1000. If the ratio is 10/10, then that is a big issue, but if the ratio is 10/100, then it may not be a big issue. Therefore, instead of plotting number of undelivered reports, it is better to plot the portion of the total reports undelivered, for example - 10% of the reports were not delivered. The proportion will be a better measure to assess than the number of undeliverable reports."

Team leaders help teams in this stage by having a plan in place to manage competition among team members, make communication easier, and make sure projects stay on track.\n\nNorming: By now, teams have figured out how to work together.  Each person works more efficiently because he or she has learned how to share their ideas and listen to feedback while working toward a common goal.\n\nPerforming: There\u2019s a high level of cohesion and trust between team members.

The CVA is extremely important because it allows an organization to gauge how they are judged in comparison to their industry rivals.\n\nCustomer value analysis (CVA) aims to maximize customer satisfaction in your business. Your product or service target location can be great. And the quality can be spot on. But if the customers are not purchasing, then the aforementioned factors are irrelevant to the business.  In other words, sales revenue is the lifeline of any business and customer is the key person if he is no longer willing to purchase your product or services."

While it is sometimes confused with task and project management, its scope is broader than these adjacent topics. Task management focuses on individual tasks whereas BPM observes the whole end-to-end process. Project management refers to a one-time scope of work while BPM focuses specifically on processes that are repeatable. Through continuous process reengineering, organizations can streamline their overall workflows, leading to increased efficiencies and cost-savings. This concept isn\u2019t new; six sigma and lean principles are examples of BPM methodologies."
