The PDE (Parallel Data Engine) is the core component of the Teradata Vantage Analytics Database that performs the work associated with generating an answer set. It is responsible for executing SQL queries and generating the results. The PDE is a highly optimized engine that can leverage the MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) architecture of Teradata Vantage to distribute the workload across multiple nodes, resulting in high performance for even the most complex queries."
