A review of publicly available\ninformation shows that there's mixed resistance to mandated government frameworks and\npolicies. Different countries approach that differently. Not all frameworks and regulations that exist align well with each other, even within a country.\n\u2022 The number of enforced cyber and physical security regulations is growing.\n\u2022 Some nation-states may have cybersecurity strategies that are still evolving.\n\u2022 Public-private partnerships are lacking in some countries and sectors.\n\u2022 Then we have the sector-specific cybersecurity plans that the governments may be putting out.\nHere in the United States, we actually have 16 different sectors, like chemical, water, electric, and even hospitals and financial banks.\n\u2022 Regulation compliance is mandatory, while standards compliance is voluntary.\n\u2022 But there is one general agreement across all the nations. No country or government can\naddress cybersecurity risk in isolation.\nRemember we talked about the fact that malware has no borders.\n\nIC32M Page 78"
