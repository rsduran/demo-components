    "answerDescription": "Typical simultaneous multithreading (SMT) implementations allow workloads from different control programs to use a compute core concurrently, but with variable core capacity gains and thread execution slowdowns. The new IBM z13 platform implements SMT differently. At any point in time, a single control program manages the entire core, giving each workload more repeatable core capacity for processing.<br>References:<br>http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp5144.html?Open",

It is designed to automatically\nimprove availability for key workloads at critical processing times and to improve access time\nfor critical business z/OS workloads. It can also reduce latency time during diagnostic\ncollection (memory dump operations)\" - redbook SG247824 - IBM z13 Technical Guide, Appendix H page 556"
