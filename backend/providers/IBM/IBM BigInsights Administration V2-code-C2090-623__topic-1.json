    "answerDescription": "You may not want all users that exist in an authentication source to have access to IBM Cognos software. To secure IBM Cognos software, configure the product so that only users who belong to a specific group or role in your authentication source, or in the Cognos namespace, are allowed access.<br>We recommend using the Cognos namespace because it contains preconfigured groups and roles that help you to secure IBM Cognos software quickly. One of the preconfigured groups is Everyone.<br>By default, the group Everyone belongs to several built-in groups and roles in the Cognos namespace.<br>If you decide to use the Cognos namespace, you must remove the Everyone group from all built-in groups and roles and replace it with groups, roles, or users authorized to access IBM Cognos software.<br>References: IBM Cognos Administration Version 10.1.0, Administration and Security Guide, page 64",
