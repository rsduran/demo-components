With serverless computing, developers do not need to worry about provisioning or managing servers, networking, or other infrastructure components, as those tasks are abstracted away by the cloud provider. This allows developers to focus solely on writing code and building applications without the need for system administrators to maintain the infrastructure. Bare metal servers, virtual servers, and containers, on the other hand, still require system administrators to manage and maintain the underlying infrastructure, including provisioning, scaling, patching, and other operational tasks."
