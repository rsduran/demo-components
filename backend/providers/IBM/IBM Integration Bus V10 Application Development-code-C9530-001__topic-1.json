The default range for the HTTPConnector is 7800 - 7842; the default range for the HTTPSConnector is 7843 - 7884. The first integration server to start an embedded listener is allocated port 7800, the second is allocated<br>7801, and so on.<br>If you deploy a message flow to multiple integration servers, the port number is incremented by one for each successive deployment. Assume that no embedded listeners have as yet been started for these integration servers. In this case, the message flow that is deployed to the first integration server receives requests on port 7800. The next message flow uses port 7801, and so on, up to the specified limit of 7842. In this scenario, you typically use an intermediary router that listens on one port, then distributes the requests across the range of ports that you are using.<br>References:<br>https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc43700_.htm",
