Other critical fields that may be included in a traceability matrix could include a \"source\" field, which specifies where each requirement or specification originated, a \"target\" field, which specifies the requirement or specification that is being traced, and a \"type\" field, which specifies the type of requirement or specification (e.g., functional, non-functional, business)"

This technique is particularly useful for generating new ideas, identifying potential solutions to problems, or exploring new opportunities.\n\nDuring a brainstorming session, a facilitator typically sets a time limit and encourages participants to speak freely and spontaneously, building on each other's ideas. All ideas are recorded without any criticism or evaluation, and participants are encouraged to think beyond their usual boundaries to generate as many ideas as possible."

It helps the business analyst to identify the key stakeholders and their roles, responsibilities, and expectations in the project. By using subject matter experts to define roles and identify influences, the business analyst can gather valuable insights that can inform the stakeholder analysis and help to ensure that the project meets the needs of all stakeholders.\n\nThe stakeholder analysis document can be used as a reference throughout the project to guide decision-making and ensure that stakeholders are engaged and informed throughout the project lifecycle."

A change control process helps to manage changes to the project scope and ensures that all changes are properly reviewed, approved, and implemented. This process would enable the business analyst to ensure that any new requirements or changes to the scope are evaluated for their impact on the project and then approved or rejected in a controlled manner. This would help to prevent scope creep and keep the project on track. A configuration management system and a communication plan may also be useful in managing scope creep, but they would not be as effective as a change control process in this particular situation. Sponsor signoff may also be useful, but it is not a comprehensive solution to managing scope creep."

Interface analysis can help to identify the inputs, outputs, and dependencies of each system, and to ensure that they are compatible and consistent with each other. Interface analysis can also help to detect potential integration issues, gaps, and conflicts among the systems. An organization that is in the process of replacing its current system should conduct interface analysis to facilitate a successful migration, as it would help to ensure that all current connections to other systems remain functional after the upgrade. The other options are not correct. Document analysis is a technique to review existing documents or records to elicit information or requirements. User interface analysis is a technique to design and evaluate how users interact with a system or product. Systems analysis is a technique to understand and model the structure, behavior, and functions of a system or process."
