The goal is to ensure that all financial aspects of the project are properly closed out, that any remaining funds are accounted for and reallocated as necessary, and to evaluate the financial management of the project for any lessons learned that can be applied to ongoing or future projects within the program."

In program management, this metric is often used to assess the financial feasibility and attractiveness of a program, especially when there are concerns about risks and costs. Management's interest in the payback period reflects a focus on understanding when the program will start to recoup its investment, which is a key consideration in decision-making and strategic planning."

The contract type is the most dangerous for the buyer.\n\nA cost plus percentage of cost contract can be risky for the buyer (in this case, your program) because it provides little incentive for the contractor to control costs. Under this type of contract, the contractor is reimbursed for all legitimate costs incurred during the project plus a percentage of these costs as profit. This means the more the contractor spends, the more profit they make, which can lead to inefficiencies and inflated costs, potentially causing financial risks for the program."

In this case, the heuristic is that resources can only be allocated to the program for a maximum of 20 hours per week. This constraint is used to balance the demand for resources with their availability, particularly when resources are shared between operational duties and the program. This approach helps in managing the workload on resources and ensures that their utilization does not negatively impact their regular operational responsibilities."

You are explaining to them, along with your program team, how certain activities in the program may cause delays in the schedule if the associated risk events come into play. The cost of impact of the risk events are minimal, but the schedule impacts could be bigger. The stakeholders are concerned about delaying the schedule beyond a given due date for the program. They would like you to determine if it is possible to add more labor, use a higher grade of material, or hire some consultants to ensure the risks do not occur in the program. They are not much concerned about the cost of the solution as long as the solution or identified risks do not delay the program completion.

In your case, adding more labor, upgrading materials, and bringing in consultants are all actions aimed at lessening the potential impact of the risks on the program's schedule. These actions are proactive measures to decrease the probability of the risk events occurring or to reduce their impact if they do occur, which is the essence of mitigation.\n\nThe other options represent different types of risk responses:\n\nA. Avoidance: This involves changing the program plan to eliminate the risk entirely or to protect the program from its impact. While mitigation reduces the impact or likelihood, avoidance removes the risk altogether."

Fallback Plan.\n\nA fallback plan is a contingency plan that is put into action when the primary risk response strategy does not work as expected or fails to fully mitigate the risk. This plan is essentially a backup approach to address the risk, providing an alternative means of risk response if the initial plan proves to be insufficient. Having a fallback plan in place is a part of thorough risk management, ensuring that the project is prepared for scenarios where the first line of defense against a risk doesn't work as intended."

A CPI value of less than 1.0 means that the project is costing more than planned for the work that has been completed, indicating a cost overrun.

Evaluate the impact, reassess the program risk, and determine options to be presented to the governance board.\n\nIn the event of an unforeseen shutdown, such as from a natural disaster, the first action the program manager should take is to evaluate the impact of the shutdown on the program's schedule, particularly concerning the major milestone and associated payment. This involves reassessing the program risks in light of the new circumstances and determining the best course of action. Once this assessment is done, the program manager should then identify various options to address the situation. These options should be presented to the governance board for decision-making, as they are responsible for overseeing the program and making key decisions in such scenarios."

Updating the risk register with this information and then seeking steering committee approval ensures that any decisions to modify the program are made with full awareness of potential consequences and with the necessary oversight and consent."

By ensuring that project managers are trained in various aspects of the program, not just their specific projects, the program manager is enhancing the overall capability and flexibility of the team. This approach helps in managing interdependencies more effectively and ensures that the team can adapt to changes or challenges within the program. It also promotes a unified understanding of the program's objectives and enhances the team's ability to work cohesively towards common goals."

The program manager needs to ensure that all the procedures for closing are in line with the governance board's expectations and that the transition of the benefits is planned and executed smoothly.

Review the benefits management plan to assess the continued validity of the program.\n\nWhen a company defines new strategic objectives, especially after an acquisition, the program manager should review the benefits management plan to ensure that the program's outcomes are still aligned with the company's strategic direction. This involves evaluating whether the program's expected benefits are still relevant and valuable in light of the new objectives and determining if adjustments to the program are necessary to accommodate changes resulting from the acquisition. This review will also guide the program manager on whether a change request is needed to realign the program with the new strategic objectives."

Analyze the business environment to identify key stakeholders, and then perform a stakeholder analysis.\n\nWhen a program manager finds that there is no existing company practice for managing key suppliers, the first step before seeking program approval should be to understand the business environment and identify the key stakeholders involved. This will likely include those stakeholders who have an interest or a potential impact on supplier management. Once the key stakeholders are identified, performing a stakeholder analysis will help the program manager understand their interests, influence, expectations, and potential impact on the program. This analysis is essential for developing effective strategies for stakeholder engagement and supplier management, which are crucial for obtaining program approval and for the success of the program."

Identification and documentation of the initial risks for ERP software implementation.\n\nIn the context of the program business case as described in the document, after performing an analysis to confirm the program's feasibility, the next important step the program manager should complete is the identification and documentation of the initial risks for ERP software implementation. This is crucial as it aligns with the need to address potential high-level risk and opportunities assessment, key assumptions, business and operational impact, cost-benefit analysis, alternative solutions, and other factors that could influence the program's success. Understanding and planning for these risks early on is essential for developing a robust business case that justifies the program and outlines how potential risks will be managed throughout the program's lifecycle."
