Risk attitude represents an organization\u2019s approach to assessing and eventually pursuing, retaining, taking, or turning away from risk. Risk attitudes can range from risk averse to risk seeking. The Reference is the Standard for Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects, Page#8\n\nThe Situational factors of risk attitude :-\n1-Level of relevant skills, knowledge, or expertise. 2- Perception of probability or frequency of occurrence. 3- Perception of impact magnitude, either severity of negative threats or size of positive opportunities. 4- Degree of perceived control or choice in the situation, Manageability is a key assessment of risk, and will influence the preferred risk attitude. 5- Closeness of the risk in time. 6- Potential for direct consequences."

An early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce the probability, a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact of a failure of the original component. PMBOK6 page#443."

Installation of these derricks requires precision placement and stable seas for the transport and installation ships to properly install the deep water structure. It takes 65 days to transport the deep water structures for each platform from the manufacturing facility to the installation site at a cost of US$155,000 per day. The monsoon season runs from May to September each year and is a known risk for placement of the oil platforms. There is an incentive clause in the contract that will provide a<br>US$1,500,000 payment, if all 40 platforms are in place and ready for use by 5 January 2016.<br>What is the probability of receiving this incentive?<br>",

Installation of these derricks requires precision placement and stable seas for the transport and installation ships to properly install the deep water structure. There are several schedule and cost incentives for early completion, and the project manager asks the project risk coordinator to perform an analysis, which will predict the probability of meeting the incentive dates. While researching methods that could be used for performing this analysis, the risk manager realizes that there are readily available spreadsheets within the organization. The risk manager is considering performing a Method of Moments (PERT) analysis with software already owned, or the other option is to buy a commercial risk analysis software suite that will perform Latin Hypercube Monte Carlo simulations at a cost of US$975.<br>What would be the best analytical option for this probability assessment?<br>",

To determine the total contingency budget that should be created, the risk manager should calculate the expected monetary value (EMV) of each risk by multiplying the probability of the risk occurring by the monetary impact of the risk.\n\nFor risk A, the EMV is 40% x $100,000 = $40,000. For risk B, the EMV is 60% x $20,000 = $12,000. The total contingency budget is the sum of the EMVs for each risk, which is $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000. Therefore, the total contingency budget that should be created is US$80,000.\n\nOther potential total contingency budgets could include US$120,000 or US$68,000. However, these values are not correct because they do not take into account the probabilities and impacts of the individual risks."

When a risk event occurs that was not previously identified, it is important for the project manager to review the project's risk management plan and identify any potential gaps or weaknesses in the risk identification process. One way to do this is to perform a new assumptions and constraints analysis to identify any potential risks that may have been overlooked or underestimated. This can involve reviewing the project's assumptions, constraints, and dependencies, as well as examining any changes that may have occurred since the initial risk assessment was conducted. By performing a new assumptions and constraints analysis, the project manager can identify any new or emerging risks that may impact the project, and can develop appropriate response strategies to mitigate or reduce the impact of those risks. This can help to ensure that the project is able to effectively manage risks throughout the project lifecycle and avoid similar risks in the future."

After implementing the planned risk response for risk B, the probability of risk B has been reduced to 0.3.

For risk A, this would be 0.6 * $50,000 = $30,000, and for risk B it would be 0.3 * $60,000 = $18,000. The total risk exposure for the project would then be $30,000 + $18,000 = $48,000.

Quantitative risk analysis is a technique that is used to quantify the likelihood and impact of identified risks, as well as to determine the overall level of exposure for each risk. It involves using statistical and mathematical methods to estimate the likelihood and impact of each risk, as well as to calculate the expected value of each risk. This can be helpful in determining the maximum level of exposure for each risk, as well as in identifying the minimum acceptable level of exposure and impact. By performing a quantitative risk analysis, the project team can better understand the potential risks and uncertainties that are facing the project, and can identify the most effective strategies for managing those risks. This can help to ensure that the project is able to effectively mitigate or reduce the impact of identified risks, while also maximizing value and minimizing risk."
