Management has hired Thomas to manage a high-risk project because Thomas has years of experience with this technology and similar project.

Management is fine with this, except after reviewing the template they had preferred Thomas to use 24-hour time periods for his project calendar rather than the 8-hour time periods as indicated. Thomas agrees, but now he has to update what document in his project management plan?<br>",

The project calendar is used to define the working and nonworking days and times for tasks. This calendar is usually used to represent an organization's traditional working hours. Project uses this calendar to schedule tasks that do not have resources assigned or that have a task type of fixed duration. By default, the Standard base calendar is used as the project calendar. A user can also reflect alternative schedules by using other base calendars. The working days and hours in the project calendar reflect the working days and hours for the whole project. A user can also specify special days off, such as company holidays. A user can also indicate other nonworking times to reflect periods when the whole team will be working on nonproject activities, such as company meetings or department retreats.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: The activities of the project are not changing, only the time periods of the project calendar.<br>C: The resource calendar does not need to be updated as this document defines when resources are available.<br>D: The schedule management plan will reference to the project calendar and the resource calendar.

The contingency reserve is calculated by multiplying the probability and the impact for the risk event value for each risk event. The sum of the risk events equals the contingency reserve for the project. The sum of the risk events equals the contingency reserve for the project. In this question, the value is $41,700.

It is the single most important characteristics of a top-class project manager. Project managers must communicate well in order to integrate and maximize the performance of team members.<br>Oral and written communications are the backbone of every successful project. During different phases of a project, a project manager requires to communicate through different manners (for example, documentation, meeting updates, etc.) and he must ensure that the information communicated is explicit, clear, and complete.<br>C: It is a technique to resolve conflict that arises while communicating with different parties.",

    "answerDescription": "If a resource leveling heuristic, such as 45 hours maximum per time period, is enforced on the project, then the project schedule will take longer to complete. What is resource leveling heuristics? Resource leveling heuristics is a prioritization method that allocates inadequate resources to critical path activities first. It is a schedule network analysis technique useful to a schedule that has already been analyzed by the critical path method. It is used when shared or critical essential resources are only available at certain times, in limited quantities, or to keep resource usage at a constant level. It is a technique that resolves resource conflicts by delaying tasks within their slack allowances. Resource leveling is the process in which project teams come across problems when developing their project schedules. If a company has multiple projects running simultaneously that require the same resources, then problems can arise. It can often cause the critical path method to change.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: The 45-hour limit is a restriction on the project.<br>C: The project will not take less time to complete because the project team members won't be able to complete as much work in the same amount of time.<br>D: The project may require more resources if the project manager and management want the project to finish by a particular date.

The salience model is a technique for categorizing stakeholders according to their importance. The various difficulties faced by the project managers are as follows: How to choose the right stakeholders? How to prioritize competing claims of the stakeholders communication needs? Stakeholder salience is determined by the evaluation of their power, legitimacy and urgency in the organization. Power is defined as the ability of the stakeholder to impose their will. Urgency is the need for immediate action. Legitimacy shows the stakeholders participation is appropriate or not. . The model allows the project manager to decide the relative salience of a particular stakeholder.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: This is a description of an influence/impact grid over the project.<br>C: This is a description of a power/impact over the project.<br>D: This is a description of a power/interest grid.",

A critical path is the sequence of project activities, which add up to the longest overall duration. This determines the shortest time possible to complete the project. Any delay of an activity on the critical path directly impacts the planned project completion date (i.e. there is no float on the critical path). A project can have several, parallel, near critical paths. An additional parallel path through the network with the total durations shorter than the critical path is called a sub-critical or non-critical path. These results allow managers to prioritize activities for the effective management of project completion, and to shorten the planned critical path of a project by pruning critical path activities, by \"fast tracking\" (i.e., performing more activities in parallel), and/ or by \"crashing the critical path\" (i.e., shortening the durations of critical path activities by adding resources).<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: The project calendar must be considered to determine when the project work is allowed to take place in the different sites.<br>C: The resource calendar must be considered for the availability of the project resource.<br>D: Time zone differences must be considered for communication demands and coordination of events between the geographical sites.",

It also groups subtasks that are not related in a logical sense of a dependency where one subtask must wait for another. A hammock activity usually refers to report information that is time-dependent and lasts from the initial to the latest date of the activities it encompasses. By using a hammock activity, the top management is able to see an overview of the project without being besieged by details.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: Project management overhead describes the work that supports the project objectives, but is not linked directly to the project deliverables.<br>C: A subproject is a discrete set of work that contributes to the project, but branches off the primary project work. A subcontract portion of the project is an example of a subproject.<br>D: Finish-to-start is the most common relationship between project activities in the project network diagram.",
