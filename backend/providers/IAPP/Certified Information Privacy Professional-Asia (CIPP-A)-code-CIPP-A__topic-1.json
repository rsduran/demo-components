After being notified during the hiring process, Singabank employees are subject to constant and thorough monitoring and tracking through CCTV cameras, computer monitoring software and keyboard loggers. Singabank does this to ensure its employees are complying with Singabank's data security policy. Bigbank is now considering acquiring Singabank's retail banking division. As part of its due diligence, Bigbank is seeking for Singabank to disclose to it all of its surveillance material on its employees, whether or not they are part of the retail banking division. Jimmy works in Singabank's investment banking division.<br>Assuming the monitoring was legal, can Singabank disclose Jimmy's personal data to Bigbank?",

It was a positive and not a reactive process, influenced by European developments and their potential effect on trade with Hong Kong. The history of the Ordinance\u2019s development shows that the Hong Kong government was concerned about possible limits on personal data flows from Europe as early as the 1981 Council of Europe Data Protection Convention, \n\nBUT heightening in the early 1990s as the European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive developed. From 1989 the HKLRC was given a very broad reference on privacy protection, and following public consultations published recommendations for data protection legislation, the majority of which were embodied in the 1995 Ordinance."

On her first day, she does an inspection of the largest property, StarOne. She starts with the hotel reception desk. Zoe sees the front desk assistant logging in to a database as he is checking in a guest. The hotel manager, Bernard, tells her that all guest data, including passport numbers, credit card numbers, home address, mobile number and other information associated with a guest's stay is held in a database. Bernard tells her not to worry about the security of the database because it is operated for Star Hotels by a local service provider called HackProof, who therefore are responsible for all the guest data.<br>Zoe notices what looks like a CCTV camera in the corner of the reception area. Bernard says they record all activity in the lobby. In fact, last Tuesday he had received a data access request from a lawyer requesting a copy of footage of all lobby activity for the preceding month. The lawyer's covering letter said that his client has never visited the hotel herself, but is investigating whether her husband has been doing so without her knowledge.<br>Zoe and Bernard head up to the hotel spa. The spa is independently owned by a company called Relax Ltd. Bernard explains that Relax Ltd is a small company and, as they don't have their own database, they transfer data about the spa guests to StarOne staff so that they can upload the data into the HackProof system. Relax Ltd staff can then login and review their guest data as needed.<br>Zoe asks more about the HackProof system. Bernard tells her that the server for the Hong Kong hotels is in Hong Kong, but there is a server in Shenzhen that has a copy of all the Hong Kong hotel data and supports the properties in China. The data is in China for back up purposes and also is accessible by staff in the China hotels so they can better service guests who visit their hotels in both territories.<br>How should Bernard respond to the lawyer\u2019s request for the CCTV footage?",

Their strategic partnership with major hospitals in these cities helped them capture an impressive market share over the years. However, with lifestyle and demographic shifts in India, the company saw a huge opportunity in door-to-door delivery of essential medical products. The need for such a service was confirmed by an independent consumer survey the firm conducted recently.<br>The company has launched their e-commerce platform in three metro cities, and plans to expand to the rest of the country in the future. Consumers need to register on the company website before they can make purchases.

After having proprietary company information being shared with competitors by former employees, she is eager to put certain measures in place to ensure that the activities of her employees, while on Dracarys' premises or when using any of Dracarys' computers and networks are not detrimental to the business.<br>Dracarys' external consultants are also advising the company on how to increase earnings. Dracary's management refuses to reduce production costs and compromise the quality of their garments, so the consultants suggested utilizing customer data to create targeted advertising and thus increase sales.<br>Dracarys and their vendor of choice must draft a contract that establishes agreement regarding all of the following factors EXCEPT?",

The Aadhaar number was a 12-digit identification number issued by the UIDAI to the residents of India. The Aadhaar project was linked with several welfare schemes, with a view to streamline the process of service delivery and remove false beneficiaries. \n\nThe Court held that using Aadhaar for the purpose of welfare schemes was constitutional, and upheld the mandatory linking of Aadhaar with PAN cards. The Aadhaar Act does not record the caste, religion, race, etc, of individuals, thus ensuring that these demographics are not used to discriminate among citizens"

Giving publicity to intimate information about an individual without his consent can prejudice his ability to maintain social relationships and pursue his career.  For instance, publishing the fact that a woman is mentally retarded, a lesbian, a prostitute, a drug addict, a transsexual, illegitimate, a patient receiving treatment for breast cancer, or an attendant in a nightclub may make it difficult for her to maintain a normal relationship with her acquaintances and family members. Thus, an individual may not want others know that he is a prodigy, a subscriber to a philanthropic society, or a wealthy person.  Individuals who are grief-stricken and public figures who have suffered a setback are particularly vulnerable to mental distress caused by unwanted publicity."
