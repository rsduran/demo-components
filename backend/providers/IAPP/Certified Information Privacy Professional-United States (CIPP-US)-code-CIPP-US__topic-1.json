Derived from traditional fair information practices, this document aimed to empower consumers by giving them more control over how businesses handle their data, by restricting collection of their personal data, and by ensuring that their data will only be used for the agreed purpose. The Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights doesn't have the force of law, and compliance is voluntary. It formed the backbone for a proposed approach to new privacy legislation from the Obama administration in 2015, but that legislation stalled. Subsequent federal legislation derived from these principles have continued to flounder in Congress. After Obama's term in office ended, the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights was removed from the White House website by the new administration.

She has owned the company for ten years and has always been concerned about protecting customers\u2019 privacy while maintaining the highest level of service. She is proud that she has built long-lasting customer relationships.<br>Although Cheryl and her staff have tried to make privacy protection a priority, the company has no formal privacy policy. So Cheryl hired Janice, a privacy professional, to help her develop one.<br>After an initial assessment, Janice created a first of a new policy. Cheryl read through the draft and was concerned about the many changes the policy would bring throughout the company. For example, the draft policy stipulates that a customer\u2019s personal information can only be held for one year after paying for a service such as a session with personal trainer. It also promises that customer information will not be shared with third parties without the written consent of the customer. The wording of these rules worries Cheryl since stored personal information often helps her company to serve her customers, even if there are long pauses between their visits. In addition, there are some third parties that provide crucial services, such as aerobics instructors who teach classes on a contract basis. Having access to customer files and understanding the fitness levels of their students helps instructors to organize their classes.<br>Janice understood Cheryl\u2019s concerns and was already formulating some ideas for revision. She tried to put Cheryl at ease by pointing out that customer data can still be kept, but that it should be classified according to levels of sensitivity. However, Cheryl was skeptical. It seemed that classifying data and treating each type differently would cause undue difficulties in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. Cheryl wants one simple data storage and access system that any employee can access if needed.<br>Even though the privacy policy was only a draft, she was beginning to see that changes within her company were going to be necessary. She told Janice that she would be more comfortable with implementing the new policy gradually over a period of several months, one department at a time.

The US-based startup develops the game and sells it through its retailers, one of which is in Europe. So, the US startup does not collect any customer data. It's the EU retailer who does that and transfers it to the US startup. Therefore, the EU retailer is the data controller, and the US startup is the data processor. Hence, the correct answer is \"B. As a data processor.\" The answer provided by the author, \"A. As a data supervisor\", is incorrect because \"Data supervisor\" is not a term used in the GDPR.

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>A US-based startup company is selling a new gaming application. One day, the CEO of the company receives an urgent letter from a prominent EU-based retail partner. Triggered by an unresolved complaint lodged by an EU resident, the letter describes an ongoing investigation by a supervisory authority into the retailer\u2019s data handling practices.<br>The complainant accuses the retailer of improperly disclosing her personal data, without consent, to parties in the United States. Further, the complainant accuses the EU-based retailer of failing to respond to her withdrawal of consent and request for erasure of her personal data. Your organization, the US-based startup company, was never informed of this request for erasure by the EU-based retail partner. The supervisory authority investigating the complaint has threatened the suspension of data flows if the parties involved do not cooperate with the investigation. The letter closes with an urgent request: \u201cPlease act immediately by identifying all personal data received from our company.\u201d<br>This is an important partnership. Company executives know that its biggest fans come from Western Europe; and this retailer is primarily responsible for the startup\u2019s rapid market penetration.<br>As the Company\u2019s data privacy leader, you are sensitive to the criticality of the relationship with the retailer.<br>Under the GDPR, the complainant\u2019s request regarding her personal information is known as what?",

Option C, the vendor's employee retention rates, is the least important factor for the company to consider when selecting a vendor to manage Personal Information (PI).\nWhile it is important for a company to consider the reputation and financial health of a vendor, as well as their employee training program, the retention rates of the vendor's employees are not a direct indicator of the vendor's ability to protect personal information.\nIt is important for the company to ensure that the vendor has appropriate security measures in place to protect personal information, such as access controls, encryption, and data breach response procedures. The company should also consider the vendor's compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws, as well as their experience working with sensitive personal information.\nOverall, while employee retention rates may indirectly reflect the quality of the vendor's services, they are not a direct factor in assessing the vendor's ability to manage personal information."

Over time, the FTC\u2019s role has expanded to include consumer protection and privacy enforcement, but these were not its initial focus.\nHere is how the IAPP textbook puts it: \"The FTC was founded in 1914 to enforce antitrust laws, and its general consumer protection mission was established by a statutory change in 1938.\"\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.

The original purpose of the Federal Trade Commission Act was to enforce antitrust laws and prevent unfair competition in the marketplace.

To enforce antitrust laws.\nReference: The IAPP textbook, U.S. Private-Sector Privacy, 4th Edition, 2024, Section 5.3."

Collecting information from a child under the age of thirteen.\nHere is why:\n1. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a U.S. law that places strict requirements on how companies can collect and use personal information from children under the age of 13. According to COPPA, companies must obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13, and they must clearly disclose their data collection practices.\n2. In this scenario, the marketer collected personal information from Matt\u2019s 10-year-old son (name, address, date of birth, etc.) without apparent parental consent. This would be a clear VIOLATION of COPPA."

By participating in an approved self-regulatory program.\nHere is why: COPPA includes a Safe Harbor provision, which allows companies to meet COPPA\u2019s requirements by participating in an FTC-approved self-regulatory program. These programs are designed to ensure compliance with COPPA\u2019s requirements, including obtaining verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. Companies that participate in these programs are subject to oversight and audits, which help ensure that they are following COPPA regulations.\n\nHere is whyA is incorrect:\nThe FTC does not specifically approve the content of individual marketing emails. The issue in the scenario is not about the content of the emails but the collection of children\u2019s personal data without proper parental consent.\n\nHere is why B is incorrect:\nWhile having a COPPA-compliant privacy notice on the website is necessary, it is not sufficient on its own to meet COPPA\u2019s Safe Harbor requirements."

In this scenario, Declan is planning to use John's name and information related to his medical situation for a paper, which would be a direct violation of HIPAA. Sharing patient information, especially identifying details like names, without explicit authorization is prohibited under HIPAA, unless certain exceptions apply (such as for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations). Since John has not given consent for his information to be shared (Declan did not even ask for it), Declan would be violating HIPAA by including this information in his paper.\n\nAccording to the author, the correct answer is C.

Distinct corporate divisions generally are considered separate sellers under the TSR.\"\n\"If a consumer tells one division of a company not to call again, a distinct corporate division of the same company may make another telemarketing call to that consumer. Nevertheless, a single seller without distinct corporate divisions may not call a consumer who asks not to be called again, even if the seller is offering a different good or service for sale.\"\n\nThis implies that as long as the divisions of the organization are selling similar products or services, if a consumer asks not to be called, that request must apply across the entire organization and its affiliates to respect the consumer's preferences and avoid violating the Do-Not-Call (DNC) rules."

Just last week, he overheard Evan mocking the state\u2019s Do Not Call list, as well as the people on it. \u201cIf they were really serious about not being bothered,\u201d Evan said, \u201cThey\u2019d be on the national DNC list. That\u2019s the only one we\u2019re required to follow. At SunriseLynx, we call until they ask us not to.\u201d<br>Bizarrely, Evan requires telemarketers to keep records of recipients who ask them to call \u201canother time.\u201d This, to Larry, is a clear indication that they don\u2019t want to be called at all. Evan doesn\u2019t see it that way.<br>Larry believes that Evan\u2019s arrogance also affects the way he treats employees. The U.S. Constitution protects American workers, and Larry believes that the rights of those at SunriseLynx are violated regularly. At first Evan seemed friendly, even connecting with employees on social media. However, following Evan\u2019s political posts, it became clear to Larry that employees with similar affiliations were the only ones offered promotions.<br>Further, Larry occasionally has packages containing personal-use items mailed to work. Several times, these have come to him already opened, even though this name was clearly marked. Larry thinks the opening of personal mail is common at SunriseLynx, and that Fourth Amendment rights are being trampled under Evan\u2019s leadership.<br>Larry has also been dismayed to overhear discussions about his coworker, Sadie. Telemarketing calls are regularly recorded for quality assurance, and although Sadie is always professional during business, her personal conversations sometimes contain sexual comments. This too is something Larry has heard Evan laughing about. When he mentioned this to a coworker, his concern was met with a shrug. It was the coworker\u2019s belief that employees agreed to be monitored when they signed on. Although personal devices are left alone, phone calls, emails and browsing histories are all subject to surveillance. In fact, Larry knows of one case in which an employee was fired after an undercover investigation by an outside firm turned up evidence of misconduct. Although the employee may have stolen from the company, Evan could have simply contacted the authorities when he first suspected something amiss.<br>Larry wants to take action, but is uncertain how to proceed.<br>In what area does Larry have a misconception about private-sector employee rights?",

However, Roberta, a privacy analyst at the company and a victim of identity theft herself, was not. Prior to the breach, she had been working on a privacy program report for the executives. How the company shared and handled data across its organization was a major concern. There were neither adequate rules about access to customer information nor procedures for purging and destroying outdated data. In her research, Roberta had discovered that even low-level employees had access to all of the company\u2019s customer data, including financial records, and that the company still had in its possession obsolete customer data going back to the 1980s.<br>Her report recommended three main reforms. First, permit access on an as-needs-to-know basis. This would mean restricting employees\u2019 access to customer information to data that was relevant to the work performed. Second, create a highly secure database for storing customers\u2019 financial information (e.g., credit card and bank account numbers) separate from less sensitive information. Third, identify outdated customer information and then develop a process for securely disposing of it.<br>When the breach occurred, the company\u2019s executives called Roberta to a meeting where she presented the recommendations in her report. She explained that the company having a national customer base meant it would have to ensure that it complied with all relevant state breach notification laws. Thanks to Roberta\u2019s guidance, the company was able to notify customers quickly and within the specific timeframes set by state breach notification laws.<br>Soon after, the executives approved the changes to the privacy program that Roberta recommended in her report. The privacy program is far more effective now because of these changes and, also, because privacy and security are now considered the responsibility of every employee.<br>Based on the problems with the company\u2019s privacy security that Roberta identifies, what is the most likely cause of the breach?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>When there was a data breach involving customer personal and financial information at a large retail store, the company\u2019s directors were shocked. However, Roberta, a privacy analyst at the company and a victim of identity theft herself, was not. Prior to the breach, she had been working on a privacy program report for the executives. How the company shared and handled data across its organization was a major concern. There were neither adequate rules about access to customer information nor procedures for purging and destroying outdated data. In her research, Roberta had discovered that even low-level employees had access to all of the company\u2019s customer data, including financial records, and that the company still had in its possession obsolete customer data going back to the 1980s.<br>Her report recommended three main reforms. First, permit access on an as-needs-to-know basis. This would mean restricting employees\u2019 access to customer information to data that was relevant to the work performed. Second, create a highly secure database for storing customers\u2019 financial information (e.g., credit card and bank account numbers) separate from less sensitive information. Third, identify outdated customer information and then develop a process for securely disposing of it.<br>When the breach occurred, the company\u2019s executives called Roberta to a meeting where she presented the recommendations in her report. She explained that the company having a national customer base meant it would have to ensure that it complied with all relevant state breach notification laws. Thanks to Roberta\u2019s guidance, the company was able to notify customers quickly and within the specific timeframes set by state breach notification laws.<br>Soon after, the executives approved the changes to the privacy program that Roberta recommended in her report. The privacy program is far more effective now because of these changes and, also, because privacy and security are now considered the responsibility of every employee.<br>What could the company have done differently prior to the breach to reduce their risk?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Matt went into his son\u2019s bedroom one evening and found him stretched out on his bed typing on his laptop.<br>\u201cDoing your homework?\u201d Matt asked hopefully.<br>\u201cNo,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI\u2019m filling out a survey.\u201d<br>Matt looked over his son\u2019s shoulder at his computer screen. \u201cWhat kind of survey?\u201d<br>\u201cIt\u2019s asking questions about my opinions.\u201d<br>\u201cLet me see,\u201d Matt said, and began reading the list of questions that his son had already answered. \u201cIt\u2019s asking your opinions about the government and citizenship. That\u2019s a little odd. You\u2019re only ten.\u201d<br>Matt wondered how the web link to the survey had ended up in his son\u2019s email inbox. Thinking the message might have been sent to his son by mistake he opened it and read it. It had come from an entity called the Leadership Project, and the content and the graphics indicated that it was intended for children. As Matt read further he learned that kids who took the survey were automatically registered in a contest to win the first book in a series about famous leaders.<br>To Matt, this clearly seemed like a marketing ploy to solicit goods and services to children. He asked his son if he had been prompted to give information about himself in order to take the survey. His son told him he had been asked to give his name, address, telephone number, and date of birth, and to answer questions about his favorite games and toys.<br>Matt was concerned. He doubted if it was legal for the marketer to collect information from his son in the way that it was. Then he noticed several other commercial emails from marketers advertising products for children in his son\u2019s inbox, and he decided it was time to report the incident to the proper authorities.<br>Depending on where Matt lives, the marketer could be prosecuted for violating which of the following?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Felicia has spent much of her adult life overseas, and has just recently returned to the U.S. to help her friend Celeste open a jewelry store in California. Felicia, despite being excited at the prospect, has a number of security concerns, and has only grudgingly accepted the need to hire other employees. In order to guard against the loss of valuable merchandise, Felicia wants to carefully screen applicants. With their permission, Felicia would like to run credit checks, administer polygraph tests, and scrutinize videos of interviews. She intends to read applicants\u2019 postings on social media, ask questions about drug addiction, and solicit character references. Felicia believes that if potential employees are serious about becoming part of a dynamic new business, they will readily agree to these requirements.<br>Felicia is also in favor of strict employee oversight. In addition to protecting the inventory, she wants to prevent mistakes during transactions, which will require video monitoring. She also wants to regularly check the company vehicle\u2019s GPS for locations visited by employees. She also believes that employees who use their own devices for work-related purposes should agree to a certain amount of supervision.<br>Given her high standards, Felicia is skeptical about the proposed location of the store. She has been told that many types of background checks are not allowed under California law. Her friend Celeste thinks these worries are unfounded, as long as applicants verbally agree to the checks and are offered access to the results. Nor does Celeste share Felicia\u2019s concern about state breach notification laws, which, she claims, would be costly to implement even on a minor scale. Celeste believes that even if the business grows a customer database of a few thousand, it\u2019s unlikely that a state agency would hassle an honest business if an accidental security incident were to occur.<br>In any case, Celeste feels that all they need is common sense \u2013 like remembering to tear up sensitive documents before throwing them in the recycling bin. Felicia hopes that she\u2019s right, and that all of her concerns will be put to rest next month when their new business consultant (who is also a privacy professional) arrives from North Carolina.<br>Regarding credit checks of potential employees, Celeste has a misconception regarding what?",

Felicia believes that if potential employees are serious about becoming part of a dynamic new business, they will readily agree to these requirements.<br>Felicia is also in favor of strict employee oversight.

She also wants to regularly check the company vehicle\u2019s GPS for locations visited by employees. She also believes that employees who use their own devices for work-related purposes should agree to a certain amount of supervision.<br>Given her high standards, Felicia is skeptical about the proposed location of the store.

Felicia hopes that she\u2019s right, and that all of her concerns will be put to rest next month when their new business consultant (who is also a privacy professional) arrives from North Carolina.<br>Which law will be most relevant to Felicia\u2019s plan to ask applicants about drug addiction?",

Negotiating consent decrees with companies found to be in violation of privacy principles benefits both parties involved by sparing the expense of going to trial.

This approach allows for a more efficient resolution to the matter and enables the company to take corrective actions more quickly. Additionally, it can help the company avoid potentially harmful publicity that could arise from a public trial or a prolonged legal battle.

This exemption means that organizations that comply with GLBA are not required to comply with certain provisions of the Nevada Privacy Law related to data security and privacy.\nD is incorrect because the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) does not explicitly include an entity exemption for organizations subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). While the VCDPA does have certain exemptions, such as for entities subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or the GLBA for data processed in compliance with those laws, it does not specifically mention an exemption for GLBA compliance. Therefore, option D is not the best choice in this context."

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br><br>You are the privacy manager at a privately-owned U.S. company that produces an increasingly popular fitness app called GetFit. After users create an account with their contact information, the app uses a smartphone and a system of connected smartwatch sensors to track users when they exercise. It collects information on location when users walk or run outdoors, as well as general health information (such as heart rate) during all exercise sessions. The app also collects credit card information for payment of the monthly subscription fee.<br><br>One Friday, the company's security team contacts you about the discovery of malware on their media server. The team assures you that there was no user data on this server and that, in any case, they found the malware before any damage could be done.<br><br>However, on Monday morning the security team contacts you again, this time with the information that they have discovered the same malware on the company's payments server. They suspect it likely that users' credit card information was taken by the attacker. By Monday evening, the situation has gotten dramatically worse, as the security team has also discovered this malware on the company's database server, an infiltration that gives the attacker access to users' profile, health and location information.<br><br>After coordinating with the security team, you are asked to meet with senior management and advise them on the company's obligations in connection with the incident. The Chief Financial Officer asks, \"If we decide to notify all our users of this incident, are we obligated to provide any of them with a free credit monitoring offer?\" The General Counsel wants to know if providing this notice and offer will help the company avoid liability.<br><br><br>What answer should be given to the General Counsel?",
