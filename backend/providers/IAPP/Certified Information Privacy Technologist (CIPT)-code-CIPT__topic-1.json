She kept things simple by only accepting cash and personal checks.<br>As business grew, Carol couldn't keep up with demand, and traveling to festivals became burdensome. Carol opened a small boutique and hired Sam to run it while she worked in the studio. Sam was a natural salesperson, and business doubled. Carol told Sam, `I don't know what you are doing, but keep doing it!\"<br>But months later, the gift shop was in chaos. Carol realized that Sam needed help so she hired Jane, who had business expertise and could handle the back- office tasks. Sam would continue to focus on sales. Carol gave Jane a few weeks to get acquainted with the artisan craft business, and then scheduled a meeting for the three of them to discuss Jane's first impressions.<br>At the meeting, Carol could not wait to hear Jane's thoughts, but she was unprepared for what Jane had to say. `Carol, I know that he doesn't realize it, but some of Sam's efforts to increase sales have put you in a vulnerable position.

That's the only information I have! The only other thing I do is post photos and information about your work on the photo sharing site that I use with family and friends. I provide my email address and people send me their information if they want to see more of your work. Posting online really helps sales, Carol. In fact, the only complaint I hear is about having to come into the shop to make a purchase.`<br>Carol replied, `Jane, that doesn't sound so bad. Could you just fix things and help us to post even more online?\"<br>`\u02dcI can,\" said Jane. `But it's not quite that simple. I need to set up a new program to make sure that we follow the best practices in data management. And I am concerned for our customers.

Any time you save data to a file, you\u2019re technically retaining it \u2014 but the term \u201cdata retention\u201d usually refers to the deliberate, systematic ways in which you store, use, and delete data. Developing a good data retention strategy requires a solid understanding of the nature, format, sensitivity, and useful lifecycle of your data. A good place to start is to create an inventory and diagram for all your data inflows and outflows1.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that where data can be placed is part of retention rather than inventory."

The company sells cell phone cases, e-cigarette cases, wine spouts, hanging air fresheners for homes and automobiles, book ends, kitchen implements, visors and shields for computer screens, passport holders, gardening tools and lawn ornaments, and catalogs full of health and beauty products. The list seems endless. As the CEO likes to say, Ancillary offers, without doubt, the widest assortment of low-price consumer products from a single company anywhere.<br>Ancillary's operations are similarly diverse. The company originated with a team of sales consultants selling home and beauty products at small parties in the homes of customers, and this base business is still thriving.

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Looking back at your first two years as the Director of Personal Information Protection and Compliance for the St. Anne's Regional Medical Center in Thorn Bay,<br>Ontario, Canada, you see a parade of accomplishments, from developing state-of-the-art simulation based training for employees on privacy protection to establishing an interactive medical records system that is accessible by patients as well as by the medical personnel. Now, however, a question you have put off looms large: how do we manage all the data-not only records produced recently, but those still on-hand from years ago? A data flow diagram generated last year shows multiple servers, databases, and work stations, many of which hold files that have not yet been incorporated into the new records system. While most of this data is encrypted, its persistence may pose security and compliance concerns. The situation is further complicated by several long-term studies being conducted by the medical staff using patient information. Having recently reviewed the major Canadian privacy regulations, you want to make certain that the medical center is observing them.<br>You recall a recent visit to the Records Storage Section in the basement of the old hospital next to the modern facility, where you noticed paper records sitting in crates labeled by years, medical condition or alphabetically by patient name, while others were in undifferentiated bundles on shelves and on the floor. On the back shelves of the section sat data tapes and old hard drives that were often unlabeled but appeared to be years old. On your way out of the records storage section, you noticed a man leaving whom you did not recognize. He carried a batch of folders under his arm, apparently records he had removed from storage.<br>You quickly realize that you need a plan of action on the maintenance, secure storage and disposal of data.<br>Which cryptographic standard would be most appropriate for protecting patient credit card information in the records system at St. Anne's Regional Medical<br>Center?<br>",

It\u2019s not a primary cryptographic standard for encrypting data.\n\nC. Obfuscation makes data less readable but does not provide strong security for sensitive information like credit card details. It\u2019s more about hiding data rather than securely encrypting it."

Tokenization.\n\nTokenization is a process that replaces sensitive data with unique identification symbols (or \u201ctokens\u201d) that retain all the essential information about the data without compromising its security. In the context of credit card information, tokenization can provide a high level of security because even if a token were to be intercepted or stolen, it would be useless to the thief without the original data it represents. This makes tokenization particularly suitable for protecting sensitive data like credit card numbers. It is widely used in the payment industry to reduce the scope of compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)."

Implement a CAPTCHA system.\n\nA CAPTCHA system can help prevent automated attacks, such as brute force or password spraying attacks, by requiring users to prove they are human before they can proceed. This would effectively limit the number of invalid login attempts because an attacker would need to solve a CAPTCHA challenge for each attempt, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This makes automated attacks much less feasible. Please note that this should be used in conjunction with other security measures like account lockouts after a certain number of failed attempts, strong password policies, and encryption to provide a comprehensive security solution."

This would be better evaluated through system testing and review of infrastructure design rather than a code audit. It\u2019s also worth noting that the durability of consent recording in the event of a server crash would also depend on factors like backup and recovery strategies, which are outside the scope of a code audit."

The application will use machine learning to recommend potential medical treatments and medications based on information collected from anonymized electronic health records. Patient users may also share health data collected from other mobile apps with the LBH app.<br>The application requires consent from the patient before importing electronic health records into the application and sharing it with their authorized physicians or healthcare provider. The patient can then review and share the recommended treatments with their physicians securely through the app. The patient user may also share location data and upload photos in the app. The patient user may also share location data and upload photos in the app for a healthcare provider to review along with the health record. The patient may also delegate access to the app.<br>LBH's privacy team meets with the Application development and Security teams, as well as key business stakeholders on a periodic basis. LBH also implements<br>Privacy by Design (PbD) into the application development process.<br>The Privacy Team is conducting a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to evaluate privacy risks during development of the application. The team must assess whether the application is collecting descriptive, demographic or any other user related data from the electronic health records that are not needed for the purposes of the application. The team is also reviewing whether the application may collect additional personal data for purposes for which the user did not provide consent.<br>What is the best way to ensure that the application only collects personal data that is needed to fulfill its primary purpose of providing potential medical and healthcare recommendations?<br>",

Differential identifiability is a privacy-enhancing technique that allows the organization to use and share aggregate information about user data, while minimizing the risk of identifying individual users. This is particularly important in the context of medical data, which can be sensitive and personal. It\u2019s worth noting that while the other options may have their own benefits in certain contexts, they do not directly address privacy concerns in the same way as differential identifiability."

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next questions:<br><br>Your company is launching a new track and trace health app during the outbreak of a virus pandemic in the US. The developers claim the app is based on privacy by design because personal data collected was considered to ensure only necessary data is captured, users are presented with a privacy notice, and they are asked to give consent before data is shared. Users can update their consent after logging into an account, through a dedicated privacy and consent hub. This is accessible through the \u2018Settings\u2019 icon from any app page then clicking \u2018My Preferences\u2019, and selecting \u2018Information Sharing and Consent\u2019 where the following choices are displayed:<br><br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to receive notifications and infection alerts\u201d;<br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to receive information on additional features or services and new products\u201d;<br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to sharing only my risk result and location information for exposure and contact tracing purposes\u201d;<br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to share my data for medical research purposes\u201d; and<br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to share my data with healthcare providers affiliated to the company\u201d.<br><br>For each choice, an \u2018ON\u2019 or \u2018OFF\u2019 tab is available The default setting is \u2018ON\u2019 for all. Users purchase a virus screening service for USS29.99 for themselves or others using the app. The virus screening service works as follows:<br><br>\u2022\tStep 1: A photo of the user\u2019s face is taken<br>\u2022\tStep 2: The user measures their temperature and adds the reading in the app<br>\u2022\tStep 3: The user is asked to read sentences so that a voice analysis can detect symptoms<br>\u2022\tStep 4: The user is asked to answer questions on known symptoms<br>\u2022\tStep 5: The user can input information on family members (name, date of birth, citizenship, home address, phone number, email and relationship).<br><br>The results are displayed as one of the following risk status \u201cLow\u201d, \u201cMedium\u201d or \u201cHigh\u201d. If the user is deemed at \"Medium\" or \"High\" risk an alert may be sent to other users, and the user is invited to seek a medical consultation and diagnostic from a healthcare provider.<br><br>A user's risk status also feeds a world map for contact tracing purposes, where users are able to check if they have been or are in close proximity of an infected person. If a user has come in contact with another individual classified as \u2018medium\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019 risk, an instant notification also alerts the user of this. The app collects location trails of every user to monitor locations visited by an infected individual. Location is collected using the phone\u2019s GPS functionality, whether the app is in use or not however the exact location of the user is \u201cblurred\u2019 for privacy reasons. Users can only see on the map circles with a 12-feet radius (approximately 4 meters wide), which is double the recommended distance for social distancing.<br><br>Which technology is best suited for the contact tracing feature of the app?",

This is because geolocation involves tracking and accessing the physical location of a device, which can raise significant privacy concerns, especially if this data is collected or used without the individual's explicit consent. The privacy technologist would need to ensure that the system handles geolocation data in a way that respects the individual's privacy and complies with relevant data protection regulations."

Users can update their consent after logging into an account, through a dedicated privacy and consent hub. This is accessible through the \u2018Settings\u2019 icon from any app page then clicking \u2018My Preferences\u2019, and selecting \u2018Information Sharing and Consent\u2019 where the following choices are displayed:<br><br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to receive notifications and infection alerts\u201d;<br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to receive information on additional features or services and new products\u201d;<br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to sharing only my risk result and location information for exposure and contact tracing purposes\u201d;<br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to share my data for medical research purposes\u201d; and<br>\u2022\t\u201cI consent to share my data with healthcare providers affiliated to the company\u201d.<br><br>For each choice, an \u2018ON\u2019 or \u2018OFF\u2019 tab is available The default setting is \u2018ON\u2019 for all.

It helps determine whether data, such as voice data in a speech recognition solution, should be processed on the device (client-side), in the cloud (server-side), or at the network edge. This decision is crucial from a privacy perspective, as it influences data security, latency, and the level of control over personal data."

Least Privilege\n\nExplanation:\n\nLeast Privilege is a security principle that states that every module (such as a process, user, or program) must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.\nIn the context of a speech recognition solution, applying the principle of Least Privilege would involve processing the voice data in the location where it is necessary for the application's functionality while minimizing unnecessary access to sensitive data. This ensures that voice data is only processed where it is required, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or exposure.\nBy limiting access to voice data to only the components of the application that require it, the organization can enhance privacy protection and reduce the potential for data breaches or misuse."
