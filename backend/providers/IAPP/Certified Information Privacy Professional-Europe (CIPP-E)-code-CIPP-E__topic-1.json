However, despite these efforts, significant differences in the implementation and enforcement of data protection laws persisted among European countries, leading to a lack of synchronization. This fragmentation was one of the key reasons for the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aimed to provide a more uniform and comprehensive data protection framework across the European Union."

He creates a program that will only export some student data: previous schools attended, grades originally obtained, grades currently obtained and first time university attended. He wants to keep the records at the individual student level. Mindful of Anna\u2019s training, Frank runs the student numbers through an algorithm to transform them into different reference numbers.

After receiving her email reminder, as required by the GDPR. After receiving her email reminder, Frank informs Anna about his performance database.<br>Ann explains to Frank that, as well as minimizing personal data, the University has to check that this new use of existing data is permissible. She also suspects that, under the GDPR, a risk analysis may have to be carried out before the data processing can take place. Anna arranges to discuss this further with Frank after she has done some additional research.<br>Frank wants to be able to work on his analysis in his spare time, so he transfers it to his home laptop (which is not encrypted). Unfortunately, when Frank takes the laptop into the University he loses it on the train. Frank has to see Anna that day to discuss compatible processing. He knows that he needs to report security incidents, so he decides to tell Anna about his lost laptop at the same time.<br>Which of the University\u2019s records does Anna NOT have to include in her record of processing activities?",

These records are available to former students after registering through Granchester\u2019s Alumni portal.<br>Department for Education records, showing how certain demographic groups (such as first-generation students) could be expected, on average, to progress. These records do not contain names or identification numbers.<br>Under their security policy, the University encrypts all of its personal data records in transit and at rest.<br>In order to improve his teaching, Frank wants to investigate how his engineering students perform in relational to Department for Education expectations. He has attended one of Anna\u2019s data protection training courses and knows that he should use no more personal data than necessary to accomplish his goal. He creates a program that will only export some student data: previous schools attended, grades originally obtained, grades currently obtained and first time university attended. He wants to keep the records at the individual student level. Mindful of Anna\u2019s training, Frank runs the student numbers through an algorithm to transform them into different reference numbers. He uses the same algorithm on each occasion so that he can update each record over time.<br>One of Anna\u2019s tasks is to complete the record of processing activities, as required by the GDPR. After receiving her email reminder, as required by the GDPR. After receiving her email reminder, Frank informs Anna about his performance database.<br>Ann explains to Frank that, as well as minimizing personal data, the University has to check that this new use of existing data is permissible. She also suspects that, under the GDPR, a risk analysis may have to be carried out before the data processing can take place. Anna arranges to discuss this further with Frank after she has done some additional research.<br>Frank wants to be able to work on his analysis in his spare time, so he transfers it to his home laptop (which is not encrypted). Unfortunately, when Frank takes the laptop into the University he loses it on the train. Frank has to see Anna that day to discuss compatible processing. He knows that he needs to report security incidents, so he decides to tell Anna about his lost laptop at the same time.<br>Before Anna determines whether Frank\u2019s performance database is permissible, what additional information does she need?",

In contrast, a Directive sets out goals that all EU countries must achieve, but it allows them to devise their own laws on how to reach these goals, which can lead to variations in implementation.\nRegards  option A,  One-Stop Shop Mechanism allows companies to deal with a single lead supervisory authority in the EU, simplifying regulatory oversight.

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>You have just been hired by a toy manufacturer based in Hong Kong. The company sells a broad range of dolls, action figures and plush toys that can be found internationally in a wide variety of retail stores. Although the manufacturer has no offices outside Hong Kong and in fact does not employ any staff outside Hong Kong, it has entered into a number of local distribution contracts. The toys produced by the company can be found in all popular toy stores throughout Europe, the United States and Asia. A large portion of the company\u2019s revenue is due to international sales.<br>The company now wishes to launch a new range of connected toys, ones that can talk and interact with children. The CEO of the company is touting these toys as the next big thing, due to the increased possibilities offered: The figures can answer children\u2019s questions on various subjects, such as mathematical calculations or the weather. Each figure is equipped with a microphone and speaker and can connect to any smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. Any mobile device within a 10-meter radius can connect to the toys via Bluetooth as well. The figures can also be associated with other figures (from the same manufacturer) and interact with each other for an enhanced play experience.<br>When a child asks the toy a question, the request is sent to the cloud for analysis, and the answer is generated on cloud servers and sent back to the figure. The answer is given through the figure\u2019s integrated speakers, making it appear as though that the toy is actually responding to the child\u2019s question. The packaging of the toy does not provide technical details on how this works, nor does it mention that this feature requires an internet connection. The necessary data processing for this has been outsourced to a data center located in South Africa. However, your company has not yet revised its consumer-facing privacy policy to indicate this.<br>In parallel, the company is planning to introduce a new range of game systems through which consumers can play the characters they acquire in the course of playing the game. The system will come bundled with a portal that includes a Near-Field Communications (NFC) reader. This device will read an RFID tag in the action figure, making the figure come to life onscreen. Each character has its own stock features and abilities, but it is also possible to earn additional ones by accomplishing game goals. The only information stored in the tag relates to the figures\u2019 abilities.

Although no one was hurt, Louis has been plagued by texts and calls from a company called Accidentable offering to help him recover compensation for personal injury. Louis has heard about insurance companies selling customers\u2019 data to third parties, and he\u2019s convinced that Accidentable must have gotten his information from Bedrock Insurance.<br>Louis has also been receiving an increased amount of marketing information from Bedrock, trying to sell him their full range of their insurance policies.<br>Perturbed by this, Louis has started looking at price comparison sites on the internet and has been shocked to find that other insurers offer much cheaper rates than Bedrock, even though he has been a loyal customer for many years. When his Bedrock policy comes up for renewal, he decides to switch to Zantrum Insurance.<br>In order to activate his new insurance policy, Louis needs to supply Zantrum with information about his No Claims bonus, his vehicle and his driving history. After researching his rights under the GDPR, he writes to ask Bedrock to transfer his information directly to Zantrum. He also takes this opportunity to ask Bedrock to stop using his personal data for marketing purposes.<br>Bedrock supplies Louis with a PDF and XML (Extensible Markup Language) versions of his No Claims Certificate, but tells Louis it cannot transfer his data directly to Zantrum as this is not technically feasible. Bedrock also explains that Louis\u2019s contract included a provision whereby Louis agreed that his data could be used for marketing purposes; according to Bedrock, it is too late for Louis to change his mind about this. It angers Louis when he recalls the wording of the contract, which was filled with legal jargon and very confusing.<br>In the meantime, Louis is still receiving unwanted calls from Accidentable Insurance. He writes to Accidentable to ask for the name of the organization that supplied his details to them. He warns Accidentable that he plans to complain to the data protection authority, because he thinks their company has been using his data unlawfully. His letter states that he does not want his data being used by them in any way.<br>Accidentable\u2019s response letter confirms Louis\u2019s suspicions. Accidentable is Bedrock Insurance\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, and they received information about Louis\u2019s accident from Bedrock shortly after Louis submitted his accident claim. Accidentable assures Louis that there has been no breach of the GDPR, as Louis\u2019s contract included, a provision in which he agreed to share his information with Bedrock\u2019s affiliates for business purposes.<br>Louis is disgusted by the way in which he has been treated by Bedrock, and writes to them insisting that all his information be erased from their computer system.<br>Which statement accurately summarizes Bedrock\u2019s obligation in regard to Louis\u2019s data portability request?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>TripBliss Inc. is a travel service company which has lost substantial revenue over the last few years. Their new manager, Oliver, suspects that this is partly due to the company\u2019s outdated website. After doing some research, he meets with a sales representative from the up-and-coming IT company Techiva, hoping that they can design a new, cutting-edge website for TripBliss Inc.\u2019s foundering business.<br>During negotiations, a Techiva representative describes a plan for gathering more customer information through detailed questionnaires, which could be used to tailor their preferences to specific travel destinations. TripBliss Inc. can choose any number of data categories \u2013 age, income, ethnicity \u2013 that would help them best accomplish their goals. Oliver loves this idea, but would also like to have some way of gauging how successful this approach is, especially since the questionnaires will require customers to provide explicit consent to having their data collected. The Techiva representative suggests that they also run a program to analyze the new website\u2019s traffic, in order to get a better understanding of how customers are using it. He explains his plan to place a number of cookies on customer devices. The cookies will allow the company to collect IP addresses and other information, such as the sites from which the customers came, how much time they spend on the TripBliss Inc. website, and which pages on the site they visit. All of this information will be compiled in log files, which Techiva will analyze by means of a special program. TripBliss Inc. would receive aggregate statistics to help them evaluate the website\u2019s effectiveness. Oliver enthusiastically engages Techiva for these services.<br>Techiva assigns the analytics portion of the project to longtime account manager Leon Santos. As is standard practice, Leon is given administrator rights to TripBliss Inc.\u2019s website, and can authorize access to the log files gathered from it. Unfortunately for TripBliss Inc., however, Leon is taking on this new project at a time when his dissatisfaction with Techiva is at a high point. In order to take revenge for what he feels has been unfair treatment at the hands of the company, Leon asks his friend Fred, a hobby hacker, for help. Together they come up with the following plan: Fred will hack into Techiva\u2019s system and copy their log files onto a USB stick. Despite his initial intention to send the USB to the press and to the data protection authority in order to denounce Techiva, Leon experiences a crisis of conscience and ends up reconsidering his plan. He decides instead to securely wipe all the data from the USB stick and inform his manager that the company\u2019s system of access control must be reconsidered.<br>If TripBliss Inc. decides not to report the incident to the supervisory authority, what would be their BEST defense?",

Martin is their recently appointed data protection officer, who oversees the company\u2019s compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy legislation.<br>The company offers both male and female clothing lines across all age demographics, including children. In doing so, the company processes large amounts of information about such customers, including preferences and sensitive financial information such as credit card and bank account numbers.<br>In an aggressive bid to build revenue growth, Jerry, the CEO, tells Martin that the company is launching a new mobile app and loyalty scheme that puts significant emphasis on profiling the company\u2019s customers by analyzing their purchases. Martin tells the CEO that: (a) the potential risks of such activities means that Zandelay needs to carry out a data protection impact assessment to assess this new venture and its privacy implications; and (b) where the results of this assessment indicate a high risk in the absence of appropriate protection measures, Zandelay may have to undertake a prior consultation with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner before implementing the app and loyalty scheme.<br>Jerry tells Martin that he is not happy about the prospect of having to directly engage with a supervisory authority and having to disclose details of Zandelay\u2019s business plan and associated processing activities.<br>What would MOST effectively assist Zandelay in conducting their data protection impact assessment?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Zandelay Fashion (\u2018Zandelay\u2019) is a successful international online clothing retailer that employs approximately 650 people at its headquarters based in Dublin, Ireland. Martin is their recently appointed data protection officer, who oversees the company\u2019s compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy legislation.<br>The company offers both male and female clothing lines across all age demographics, including children. In doing so, the company processes large amounts of information about such customers, including preferences and sensitive financial information such as credit card and bank account numbers.<br>In an aggressive bid to build revenue growth, Jerry, the CEO, tells Martin that the company is launching a new mobile app and loyalty scheme that puts significant emphasis on profiling the company\u2019s customers by analyzing their purchases. Martin tells the CEO that: (a) the potential risks of such activities means that Zandelay needs to carry out a data protection impact assessment to assess this new venture and its privacy implications; and (b) where the results of this assessment indicate a high risk in the absence of appropriate protection measures. Zandelay may have to undertake a prior consultation with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner before implementing the app and loyalty scheme.<br>Jerry tells Martin that he is not happy about the prospect of having to directly engage with a supervisory authority and having to disclose details of Zandelay\u2019s business plan and associated processing activities.<br>What must Zandelay provide to the supervisory authority during the prior consultation?",

This company has branches in many EU member states, but for the purposes of the GDPR maintains its primary establishment in France. Javier lives in Newry, Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.), and commutes across the border to work in Dundalk, Ireland. Two years ago while on a business trip, Javier was photographed while working out at a branch of EVERFIT in Frankfurt, Germany. At the time, Javier gave his consent to being included in the photograph, since he was told that it would be used for promotional purposes only. Since then, the photograph has been used in the club\u2019s U.K. brochures, and it features in the landing page of its U.K. website. However, the fitness club has recently fallen into disrepute due to widespread mistreatment of members at various branches of the club in several EU member states. As a result, Javier no longer feels comfortable with his photograph being publicly associated with the fitness club.<br>After numerous failed attempts to book an appointment with the manager of the local branch to discuss this matter, Javier sends a letter to EVETFIT requesting that his image be removed from the website and all promotional materials. Months pass and Javier, having received no acknowledgment of his request, becomes very anxious about this matter. After repeatedly failing to contact EVETFIT through alternate channels, he decides to take action against the company.<br>Javier contacts the U.K. Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (\u2018ICO\u2019 \u2013 the U.K.\u2019s supervisory authority) to lodge a complaint about this matter. The ICO, pursuant to Article 56 (3) of the GDPR, informs the CNIL (i.e. the supervisory authority of EVERFIT\u2019s main establishment) about this matter.

The CNIL liaises with the ICO, as relevant under the cooperation procedure. In light of issues amongst the supervisory authorities to reach a decision, the European Data Protection Board becomes involved and, pursuant to the consistency mechanism, issues a binding decision.<br>Additionally, Javier sues EVERFIT for the damages caused as a result of its failure to honor his request to have his photograph removed from the brochure and website.<br>Under the cooperation mechanism, what should the lead authority (the CNIL) do after it has formed its view on the matter?",

Ronan is their recently appointed data protection officer, who oversees the company\u2019s compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy legislation.<br>The company offers both male and female clothing lines across all age demographics, including children. In doing so, the company processes large amounts of information about such customers, including preferences and sensitive financial information such as credit card and bank account numbers.<br>In an aggressive bid to build revenue growth, Jonas, the CEO, tells Ronan that the company is launching a new mobile app and loyalty scheme that puts significant emphasis on profiling the company\u2019s customers by analyzing their purchases. Ronan tells the CEO that: (a) the potential risks of such activities means that Dynaroux needs to carry out a data protection impact assessment to assess this new venture and its privacy implications; and (b) where the results of this assessment indicate a high risk in the absence of appropriate protection measures, Dynaroux may have to undertake a prior consultation with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner before implementing the app and loyalty scheme.<br>Jonas tells Ronan that he is not happy about the prospect of having to directly engage with a supervisory authority and having to disclose details of Dynaroux\u2019s business plan and associated processing activities.<br>Which of the following facts about Dynaroux would trigger a data protection impact assessment under the GDPR?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>T-Craze, a German-headquartered specialty t-shirt company, was successfully selling to large German metropolitan cities. However, after a recent merger with another German-based company that was selling to a broader European market, T-Craze revamped its marketing efforts to sell to a wider audience. These efforts included a complete redesign of its logo to reflect the recent merger, and improvements to its website meant to capture more information about visitors through the use of cookies.<br>T-Craze also opened various office locations throughout Europe to help expand its business. While Germany continued to host T-Craze\u2019s headquarters and main product-design office, its French affiliate became responsible for all marketing and sales activities. The French affiliate recently procured the services of Right Target, a renowned marketing firm based in the Philippines, to run its latest marketing campaign. After thorough research, Right Target determined that T-Craze is most successful with customers between the ages of 18 and 22. Thus, its first campaign targeted university students in several European capitals, which yielded nearly 40% new customers for T-Craze in one quarter. Right Target also ran subsequent campaigns for T-Craze, though with much less success.<br>The last two campaigns included a wider demographic group and resulted in countless unsubscribe requests, including a large number in Spain. In fact, the Spanish data protection authority received a complaint from Sofia, a mid-career investment banker. Sofia was upset after receiving a marketing communication even after unsubscribing from such communications from the Right Target on behalf of T-Craze.<br>What is the best option for the lead regulator when responding to the Spanish supervisory authority\u2019s notice that it plans to take action regarding Sofia\u2019s complaint?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question<br>Louis, a long-time customer of Bedrock Insurance, was involved in a minor car accident a few months ago. Although no one was hurt, Louis has been plagued by texts and calls from a company called Accidentable offering to help him recover compensation for personal injury. Louis has heard about insurance companies selling customers\u2019 data to third parties, and he\u2019s convinced that Accidentable must have gotten his information from Bedrock Insurance.<br>Louis has also been receiving an increased amount of marketing information from Bedrock, trying to sell him their full range of their insurance policies.<br>Perturbed by this, Louis has started looking at price comparison sites on the internet and has been shocked to find that other insurers offer much cheaper rates than Bedrock, even though he has been a loyal customer for many years. When his Bedrock policy comes up for renewal, he decides to switch to Zantrum Insurance.<br>In order to activate his new insurance policy, Louis needs to supply Zantrum with information about his No Claims bonus, his vehicle and his driving history. After researching his rights under the GDPR, he writes to ask Bedrock to transfer his information directly to Zantrum. He also takes this opportunity to ask Bedrock to stop using his personal data for marketing purposes.<br>Bedrock supplies Louis with a PDF and XML (Extensible Markup Language) versions of his No Claims Certificate, but tells Louis it cannot transfer his data directly to Zantrum as this is not technically feasible. Bedrock also explains that Louis\u2019s contract included a provision whereby Louis agreed that his data could be used for marketing purposes; according to Bedrock, it is too late for Louis to change his mind about this. It angers Louis when he recalls the wording of the contract, which was filled with legal jargon and very confusing.<br>In the meantime, Louis is still receiving unwanted calls from Accidentable Insurance. He writes to Accidentable to ask for the name of the organization that supplied his details to them. He warns Accidentable that he plans to complain to the data protection authority, because he thinks their company has been using his data unlawfully. His letter states that he does not want his data being used by them in any way.<br>Accidentable\u2019s response letter confirms Louis\u2019s suspicions. Accidentable is Bedrock Insurance\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, and they received information about Louis\u2019s accident from Bedrock shortly after Louis submitted his accident claim. Accidentable assures Louis that there has been no breach of the GDPR, as Louis\u2019s contract included, a provision in which he agreed to share his information with Bedrock\u2019s affiliates for business purposes.<br>Louis is disgusted by the way in which he has been treated by Bedrock, and writes to them insisting that all his information be erased from their computer system.<br>Based on the GDPR\u2019s position on the use of personal data for direct marketing purposes, which of the following is true about Louis\u2019s rights as a data subject?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>TripBliss Inc. is a travel service company which has lost substantial revenue over the last few years. Their new manager, Oliver, suspects that this is partly due to the company\u2019s outdated website. After doing some research, he meets with a sales representative from the up-and-coming IT company Techiva, hoping that they can design a new, cutting-edge website for TripBliss Inc.\u2019s foundering business.<br>During negotiations, a Techiva representative describes a plan for gathering more customer information through detailed questionnaires, which could be used to tailor their preferences to specific travel destinations. TripBliss Inc. can choose any number of data categories \u2013 age, income, ethnicity \u2013 that would help them best accomplish their goals. Oliver loves this idea, but would also like to have some way of gauging how successful this approach is, especially since the questionnaires will require customers to provide explicit consent to having their data collected. The Techiva representative suggests that they also run a program to analyze the new website\u2019s traffic, in order to get a better understanding of how customers are using it. He explains his plan to place a number of cookies on customer devices. The cookies will allow the company to collect IP addresses and other information, such as the sites from which the customers came, how much time they spend on the TripBliss Inc. website, and which pages on the site they visit. All of this information will be compiled in log files, which Techiva will analyze by means of a special program. TripBliss Inc. would receive aggregate statistics to help them evaluate the website\u2019s effectiveness. Oliver enthusiastically engages Techiva for these services.<br>Techiva assigns the analytics portion of the project to longtime account manager Leon Santos. As is standard practice, Leon is given administrator rights to TripBliss Inc.\u2019s website, and can authorize access to the log files gathered from it. Unfortunately for TripBliss Inc., however, Leon is taking on this new project at a time when his dissatisfaction with Techiva is at a high point. In order to take revenge for what he feels has been unfair treatment at the hands of the company, Leon asks his friend Fred, a hobby hacker, for help. Together they come up with the following plan: Fred will hack into Techiva\u2019s system and copy their log files onto a USB stick. Despite his initial intention to send the USB to the press and to the data protection authority in order to denounce Techiva, Leon experiences a crisis of conscience and ends up reconsidering his plan. He decides instead to securely wipe all the data from the USB stick and inform his manager that the company\u2019s system of access control must be reconsidered.<br>After Leon has informed his manager, what is Techiva\u2019s legal responsibility as a processor?",

Bob calls this work plan, We-Text-U. Once the company has gathered enough pre-registrations, it will develop EU-specific content and services.<br>Another plan is called Customer for Life. The idea is to offer additional services through the company\u2019s app, like storage and sharing of DNA information with other applications and medical providers. The company\u2019s contract says that it can keep customer DNA indefinitely, and use it to offer new services and market them to customers. It also says that customers agree not to withdraw direct marketing consent. Paul, the marketing director, suggests that the company should fully exploit these provisions, and that it can work around customers\u2019 attempts to withdraw consent because the contract invalidates them.<br>The final plan is to develop a brand presence in the EU. The company has already begun this process. It is in the process of purchasing the naming rights for a building in Germany, which would come with a few offices that Who-R-U executives can use while traveling internationally. The office doesn\u2019t include any technology or infrastructure; rather, it\u2019s simply a room with a desk and some chairs.<br>On a recent trip concerning the naming-rights deal, Bob\u2019s laptop is stolen. The laptop held unencrypted DNA reports on 5,000 Who-R-U customers, all of whom are residents of Canada. The reports include customer name, birthdate, ethnicity, racial background, names of relatives, gender, and occasionally health information.<br>Who-R-U is NOT required to notify the local German DPA about the laptop theft because?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br><br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br><br>Jane starts her new role as a Data Protection Officer (DPO) at a Malta-based company that allows anyone to buy and sell cryptocurrencies via its online platform. The company stores and processes the personal data of its customers in a dedicated data center located in Malta (EU).<br><br>People wishing to trade cryptocurrencies are required to open an online account on the platform. They then must successfully pass a Know Your Customer (KYC) due diligence procedure aimed at preventing money laundering and ensuring compliance with applicable financial regulations.<br><br>The non-European customers are also required to waive all their GDPR rights by reading a disclaimer written in bold and ticking a checkbox on a separate page in order to get their account approved on the platform.<br><br>All customers must likewise accept the terms of service of the platform. The terms of service also include a privacy policy section, saying, among other things, that if a customer fails the KYC process, its KYC data will be automatically shared with the national anti-money laundering agency.<br><br>The KYC procedure requires customers to answer many questions, including whether they have any criminal convictions, whether they use recreational drugs or have problems with alcohol, and whether they have a terminal illness. While providing this data, customers see a conspicuous message saying that this data is meant only to prevent fraud and account takeover, and will be never shared with private third parties.<br><br>The company regularly conducts external security testing of its online systems by independent cybersecurity companies from the EU. At the final stage of testing, the company provides cybersecurity assessors with access to its central database to review security permissions, roles and policies. Personal data in the database is encrypted; however, cybersecurity assessors usually have access to the decryption keys obtained while running initial security testing. The assessors must strictly follow the guidelines imposed by the company during the entire testing and auditing process.<br><br>All customer data, including trading activities and all internal communications with technical support, are permanently stored in a secured AWS S3 Glacier cloud data storage, located in Ireland, for backup and compliance purposes. The data is securely transferred to the cloud and then is properly encrypted while at rest by using AWS-native encryption mechanisms. These mechanisms give AWS the necessary technical means to encrypt and decrypt the data when such is required by the company. There is no data processing agreement between AWS and the company.<br><br><br>What is potentially wrong with the backup system operated in the AWS cloud?",

To celebrate this achievement, ARRA Hotels' Human Resources office, based in ARRA's main Italian establishment, has organized a team event for its 420 employees and their families at its hotel in Spain.<br><br>Upon arrival at the hotel, each employee and family member is given an electronic wristband at the reception desk. The wristband serves a number of functions:<br><br>\u2022\tAllows access to the \"party zone\" of the hotel, and emits a buzz if the user approaches any unauthorized areas<br>\u2022\tAllows up to three free drinks for each person of legal age, and emits a buzz once this limit has been reached<br>\u2022\tGrants a unique ID number for participating in the games and contests that have been planned.<br><br>Along with the wristband, each guest receives a QR code that leads to the online privacy notice describing the use of the wristband. The page also contains an unchecked consent checkbox. In the case of employee family members under the age of 16, consent must be given by a parent.<br><br>Among the various activities planned for the event, ARRA Hotels' HR office has autonomously set up a photocall area, separate from the main event venue, where employees can come and have their pictures taken in traditional carnival costume. The photos will be posted on ARRA Hotels' main website for general marketing purposes.<br><br>On the night of the event, an employee from one of ARRA's Greek hotels is displeased with the results of the photos in which he appears. He intends to file a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority in regard to the following:<br><br>\u2022\tThe lack of any privacy notice in the separate photocall area<br>\u2022\tThe unlawful cross-border processing of his personal data<br>\u2022\tThe unacceptable aesthetic outcome of his photos<br><br><br>Which of the following is NOT necessarily considered a factor in identifying whether the processing could be considered a \"cross-border processing\"?",

As a result, the company plans to implement a robust but privacy-friendly remote surveillance system to prevent absenteeism, reward top performers, and ensure the best quality of customer service when sales people are interacting with customers.<br><br>Gentle Hedgehog eventually hires Sauron Eye Inc., a Chinese vendor of employee surveillance software whose European headquarters is in Germany. Sauron Eye s software provides powerful remote-monitoring capabilities, including 24/7 access to computer cameras and microphones, screen captures, emails, website history, and keystrokes. Any device can be remotely monitored from a central server that is securely installed at Gentle Hedgehog headquarters. The monitoring is invisible by default; however, a so-called Transparent Mode, which regularly and conspicuously notifies all users about the monitoring and its precise scope, also exists. Additionally, the monitored employees are required to use a built-in verification technology involving facial recognition each time they log in.<br><br>All monitoring data, including the facial recognition data, is securely stored in Microsoft Azure cloud servers operated by Sauron Eye, which are physically located in France.<br><br>What monitoring may be lawfully performed within the scope of Gentle Hedgehog\u2019s business?",
