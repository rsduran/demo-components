To put it into context, the CIPM highlights the importance of understanding the context you are working in, i.e. not seeing data protection as a standalone issue, but something which responds to the context of the organisation you are working for. So issues like the wider organisational context, type of business, cultural norms, risk appetite of your organisation, and so on, are all factors in ensuring that the privacy program is positioned to respond to those needs as well as the more privacy/data protection specific legal and regulatory requirements."

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Manasa is a product manager at Omnipresent Omnimedia, where she is responsible for leading the development of the company's flagship product, the Handy Helper. The Handy Helper is an application that can be used in the home to manage family calendars, do online shopping, and schedule doctor appointments. After having had a successful launch in the United States, the Handy Helper is about to be made available for purchase worldwide.<br>The packaging and user guide for the Handy Helper indicate that it is a \"privacy friendly\" product suitable for the whole family, including children, but does not provide any further detail or privacy notice. In order to use the application, a family creates a single account, and the primary user has access to all information about the other users. Upon start up, the primary user must check a box consenting to receive marketing emails from Omnipresent Omnimedia and selected marketing partners in order to be able to use the application.<br>Sanjay, the head of privacy at Omnipresent Omnimedia, was working on an agreement with a European distributor of Handy Helper when he fielded many questions about the product from the distributor. Sanjay needed to look more closely at the product in order to be able to answer the questions as he was not involved in the product development process.<br>In speaking with the product team, he learned that the Handy Helper collected and stored all of a user's sensitive medical information for the medical appointment scheduler. In fact, all of the user's information is stored by Handy Helper for the additional purpose of creating additional products and to analyze usage of the product. This data is all stored in the cloud and is encrypted both during transmission and at rest.<br>Consistent with the CEO's philosophy that great new product ideas can come from anyone, all Omnipresent Omnimedia employees have access to user data under a program called Eureka. Omnipresent Omnimedia is hoping that at some point in the future, the data will reveal insights that could be used to create a fully automated application that runs on artificial intelligence, but as of yet, Eureka is not well-defined and is considered a long-term goal.<br>What step in the system development process did Manasa skip?",

This could pose several risks and challenges for the company, such as:\n\nLosing data if Anton or Kenneth forgets the password or leaves the company without sharing it with others.\nDelaying data retrieval if Anton or Kenneth is unavailable or unresponsive when someone else needs the data urgently.\nViolating data protection laws or regulations that require data access by certain parties or authorities under certain circumstances.\nReducing data quality or accuracy if Anton or Kenneth fails to update or maintain the data properly.\nMissing business opportunities or insights if Anton or Kenneth does not share the data with other relevant stakeholders or departments."

He plans to hire more employees once Richard gets settled and assesses the office's strategies for growth.<br>Immediately upon arrival, Richard was amazed at the amount of work that needed to done in order to modernize the office, mostly in regard to the handling of clients' personal data. His first goal is to digitize all the records kept in file cabinets, as many of the documents contain personally identifiable financial and medical data. Also, Richard has noticed the massive amount of copying by the administrative assistant throughout the day, a practice that not only adds daily to the number of files in the file cabinets, but may create security issues unless a formal policy is firmly in place Richard is also concerned with the overuse of the communal copier/printer located in plain view of clients who frequent the building. Yet another area of concern is the use of the same fax machine by all of the employees. Richard hopes to reduce its use dramatically in order to ensure that personal data receives the utmost security and protection, and eventually move toward a strict Internet faxing policy by the year's end.<br>Richard expressed his concerns to his grandfather, who agreed, that updating data storage, data security, and an overall approach to increasing the protection of personal data in all facets is necessary Mr. McAdams granted him the freedom and authority to do so. Now Richard is not only beginning a career as an attorney, but also functioning as the privacy officer of the small firm. Richard plans to meet with the IT employee the following day, to get insight into how the office computer system is currently set-up and managed.<br>Richard needs to closely monitor the vendor in charge of creating the firm's database mainly because of what?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Amira is thrilled about the sudden expansion of NatGen. As the joint Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with her long-time business partner Sadie, Amira has watched the company grow into a major competitor in the green energy market. The current line of products includes wind turbines, solar energy panels, and equipment for geothermal systems. A talented team of developers means that NatGen's line of products will only continue to grow.<br>With the expansion, Amira and Sadie have received advice from new senior staff members brought on to help manage the company's growth. One recent suggestion has been to combine the legal and security functions of the company to ensure observance of privacy laws and the company's own privacy policy. This sounds overly complicated to Amira, who wants departments to be able to use, collect, store, and dispose of customer data in ways that will best suit their needs. She does not want administrative oversight and complex structuring to get in the way of people doing innovative work.<br>Sadie has a similar outlook. The new Chief Information Officer (CIO) has proposed what Sadie believes is an unnecessarily long timetable for designing a new privacy program. She has assured him that NatGen will use the best possible equipment for electronic storage of customer and employee data. She simply needs a list of equipment and an estimate of its cost. But the CIO insists that many issues are necessary to consider before the company gets to that stage.<br>Regardless, Sadie and Amira insist on giving employees space to do their jobs. Both CEOs want to entrust the monitoring of employee policy compliance to low-level managers. Amira and Sadie believe these managers can adjust the company privacy policy according to what works best for their particular departments. NatGen's CEOs know that flexible interpretations of the privacy policy in the name of promoting green energy would be highly unlikely to raise any concerns with their customer base, as long as the data is always used in course of normal business activities.<br>Perhaps what has been most perplexing to Sadie and Amira has been the CIO's recommendation to institute a privacy compliance hotline. Sadie and Amira have relented on this point, but they hope to compromise by allowing employees to take turns handling reports of privacy policy violations. The implementation will be easy because the employees need no special preparation. They will simply have to document any concerns they hear.<br>Sadie and Amira are aware that it will be challenging to stay true to their principles and guard against corporate culture strangling creativity and employee morale. They hope that all senior staff will see the benefit of trying a unique approach.<br>Based on the scenario, what additional change will increase the effectiveness of the privacy compliance hotline?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>It's just what you were afraid of. Without consulting you, the information technology director at your organization launched a new initiative to encourage employees to use personal devices for conducting business. The initiative made purchasing a new, high-specification laptop computer an attractive option, with discounted laptops paid for as a payroll deduction spread over a year of paychecks. The organization is also paying the sales taxes. It's a great deal, and after a month, more than half the organization's employees have signed on and acquired new laptops. Walking through the facility, you see them happily customizing and comparing notes on their new computers, and at the end of the day, most take their laptops with them, potentially carrying personal data to their homes or other unknown locations. It's enough to give you data-protection nightmares, and you've pointed out to the information technology Director and many others in the organization the potential hazards of this new practice, including the inevitability of eventual data loss or theft.<br>Today you have in your office a representative of the organization's marketing department who shares with you, reluctantly, a story with potentially serious consequences. The night before, straight from work, with laptop in hand, he went to the Bull and Horn Pub to play billiards with his friends. A fine night of sport and socializing began, with the laptop \"safely\" tucked on a bench, beneath his jacket. Later that night, when it was time to depart, he retrieved the jacket, but the laptop was gone. It was not beneath the bench or on another bench nearby. The waitstaff had not seen it. His friends were not playing a joke on him. After a sleepless night, he confirmed it this morning, stopping by the pub to talk to the cleanup crew. They had not found it. The laptop was missing. Stolen, it seems. He looks at you, embarrassed and upset.<br>You ask him if the laptop contains any personal data from clients, and, sadly, he nods his head, yes. He believes it contains files on about 100 clients, including names, addresses and governmental identification numbers. He sighs and places his head in his hands in despair.<br>Which is the best way to ensure that data on personal equipment is protected?",

Encryption is one of the most effective technical safeguards for data protection and is recommended by many privacy laws and standards."

Without consulting you, the information technology director at your organization launched a new initiative to encourage employees to use personal devices for conducting business. The initiative made purchasing a new, high-specification laptop computer an attractive option, with discounted laptops paid for as a payroll deduction spread over a year of paychecks. The organization is also paying the sales taxes. It's a great deal, and after a month, more than half the organization's employees have signed on and acquired new laptops. Walking through the facility, you see them happily customizing and comparing notes on their new computers, and at the end of the day, most take their laptops with them, potentially carrying personal data to their homes or other unknown locations. It's enough to give you data-protection nightmares, and you've pointed out to the information technology Director and many others in the organization the potential hazards of this new practice, including the inevitability of eventual data loss or theft.<br>Today you have in your office a representative of the organization's marketing department who shares with you, reluctantly, a story with potentially serious consequences. The night before, straight from work, with laptop in hand, he went to the Bull and Horn Pub to play billiards with his friends. A fine night of sport and socializing began, with the laptop \"safely\" tucked on a bench, beneath his jacket. Later that night, when it was time to depart, he retrieved the jacket, but the laptop was gone. It was not beneath the bench or on another bench nearby. The waitstaff had not seen it. His friends were not playing a joke on him. After a sleepless night, he confirmed it this morning, stopping by the pub to talk to the cleanup crew. They had not found it. The laptop was missing. Stolen, it seems. He looks at you, embarrassed and upset.<br>You ask him if the laptop contains any personal data from clients, and, sadly, he nods his head, yes. He believes it contains files on about 100 clients, including names, addresses and governmental identification numbers. He sighs and places his head in his hands in despair.<br>From a business standpoint, what is the most productive way to view employee use of personal equipment for work-related tasks?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Natalia, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Nationwide Grill restaurant chain, had never seen her fellow executives so anxious. Last week, a data processing firm used by the company reported that its system may have been hacked, and customer data such as names, addresses, and birthdays may have been compromised. Although the attempt was proven unsuccessful, the scare has prompted several Nationwide Grill executives to question the company's privacy program at today's meeting.<br>Alice, a Vice President (VP), said that the incident could have opened the door to lawsuits, potentially damaging Nationwide Grill's market position. The Chief Information Officer (CIO), Brendan, tried to assure her that even if there had been an actual breach, the chances of a successful suit against the company were slim. But Alice remained unconvinced.<br>Spencer \u2013 a former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and currently a senior advisor \u2013 said that he had always warned against the use of contractors for data processing. At the very least, he argued, they should be held contractually liable for telling customers about any security incidents. In his view, Nationwide Grill should not be forced to soil the company name for a problem it did not cause.<br>One of the Business Development (BD) executives, Haley, then spoke, imploring everyone to see reason. \"Breaches can happen, despite organizations' best efforts,\" she remarked. \"Reasonable preparedness is key.\" She reminded everyone of the incident seven years ago when the large grocery chain Tinkerton's had its financial information compromised after a large order of Nationwide Grill frozen dinners. As a long-time BD executive with a solid understanding of Tinkerton's's corporate culture, built up through many years of cultivating relationships, Haley was able to successfully manage the company's incident response.<br>Spencer replied that acting with reason means allowing security to be handled by the security functions within the company \u2013 not BD staff. In a similar way, he said, Human Resources (HR) needs to do a better job training employees to prevent incidents. He pointed out that Nationwide Grill employees are overwhelmed with posters, emails, and memos from both HR and the ethics department related to the company's privacy program. Both the volume and the duplication of information means that it is often ignored altogether.<br>Spencer said, \"The company needs to dedicate itself to its privacy program and set regular in-person trainings for all staff once a month.\"<br>Alice responded that the suggestion, while well-meaning, is not practical. With many locations, local HR departments need to have flexibility with their training schedules. Silently, Natalia agreed.<br>What is the most realistic step the organization can take to help diminish liability in the event of another incident?",

Including appropriate language about privacy protection in vendor contracts can help to define the scope, purpose, duration and type of data processing, as well as the rights and obligations of both parties. The contracts can also specify the technical and organizational measures that the vendor must implement to protect the data from unauthorized or unlawful access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction, and to notify the organization of any security incidents or breaches. The contracts can also allow the organization to monitor, audit or inspect the vendor\u2019s performance and compliance with the contract terms and applicable laws and regulations."

From a cursory review, all the data still appears to be where it is meant to be but he can't shake off the feeling that something is not right. He knows that it is a possibility that this could be a colleague performing unscheduled maintenance, but he recalls an email from his company's security team reminding employees to be on alert for attacks from a known group of malicious actors specifically targeting the industry.<br>Ben is a diligent employee and wants to make sure that he protects the company but he does not want to bother his hard-working colleagues on the weekend.

Despite his years of experience, Albert is often overlooked for managerial positions. His frustration about not being promoted, coupled with his recent interest in issues of privacy protection, have motivated Albert to be an agent of positive change.<br>He will soon interview for a newly advertised position, and during the interview, Albert plans on making executives aware of lapses in the company\u2019s privacy program. He feels certain he will be rewarded with a promotion for preventing negative consequences resulting from the company\u2019s outdated policies and procedures.<br>For example, Albert has learned about the AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountans)/CICA (Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants) Privacy Maturity Model (PMM). Albert thinks the model is a useful way to measure Treasure Box\u2019s ability to protect personal data. Albert has noticed that Treasure Box fails to meet the requirements of the highest level of maturity of this model; at his interview, Albert will pledge to assist the company with meeting this level in order to provide customers with the most rigorous security available.<br>Albert does want to show a positive outlook during his interview. He intends to praise the company\u2019s commitment to the security of customer and employee personal data against external threats. However, Albert worries about the high turnover rate within the company, particularly in the area of direct phone marketing. He sees many unfamiliar faces every day who are hired to do the marketing, and he often hears complaints in the lunch room regarding long hours and low pay, as well as what seems to be flagrant disregard for company procedures.<br>In addition, Treasure Box has had two recent security incidents. The company has responded to the incidents with internal audits and updates to security safeguards. However, profits still seem to be affected and anecdotal evidence indicates that many people still harbor mistrust. Albert wants to help the company recover. He knows there is at least one incident the public in unaware of, although Albert does not know the details.

One further way that Albert wants to help Treasure Box regain its stature is by creating a toll-free number for customers, as well as a more efficient procedure for responding to customer concerns by postal mail.<br>In addition to his suggestions for improvement, Albert believes that his knowledge of the company\u2019s recent business maneuvers will also impress the interviewers. For example, Albert is aware of the company\u2019s intention to acquire a medical supply company in the coming weeks.<br>With his forward thinking, Albert hopes to convince the managers who will be interviewing him that he is right for the job.<br>In consideration of the company\u2019s new initiatives, which of the following laws and regulations would be most appropriate for Albert to mention at the interview as a priority concern for the privacy team?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>For 15 years, Albert has worked at Treasure Box \u2013 a mail order company in the United States (U.S.) that used to sell decorative candles around the world, but has recently decided to limit its shipments to customers in the 48 contiguous states. Despite his years of experience, Albert is often overlooked for managerial positions. His frustration about not being promoted, coupled with his recent interest in issues of privacy protection, have motivated Albert to be an agent of positive change.<br>He will soon interview for a newly advertised position, and during the interview, Albert plans on making executives aware of lapses in the company\u2019s privacy program. He feels certain he will be rewarded with a promotion for preventing negative consequences resulting from the company\u2019s outdated policies and procedures.<br>For example, Albert has learned about the AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountans)/CICA (Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants) Privacy Maturity Model (PMM). Albert thinks the model is a useful way to measure Treasure Box\u2019s ability to protect personal data. Albert has noticed that Treasure Box fails to meet the requirements of the highest level of maturity of this model; at his interview, Albert will pledge to assist the company with meeting this level in order to provide customers with the most rigorous security available.<br>Albert does want to show a positive outlook during his interview. He intends to praise the company\u2019s commitment to the security of customer and employee personal data against external threats. However, Albert worries about the high turnover rate within the company, particularly in the area of direct phone marketing. He sees many unfamiliar faces every day who are hired to do the marketing, and he often hears complaints in the lunch room regarding long hours and low pay, as well as what seems to be flagrant disregard for company procedures.<br>In addition, Treasure Box has had two recent security incidents. The company has responded to the incidents with internal audits and updates to security safeguards. However, profits still seem to be affected and anecdotal evidence indicates that many people still harbor mistrust. Albert wants to help the company recover. He knows there is at least one incident the public in unaware of, although Albert does not know the details. He believes the company\u2019s insistence on keeping the incident a secret could be a further detriment to its reputation. One further way that Albert wants to help Treasure Box regain its stature is by creating a toll-free number for customers, as well as a more efficient procedure for responding to customer concerns by postal mail.<br>In addition to his suggestions for improvement, Albert believes that his knowledge of the company\u2019s recent business maneuvers will also impress the interviewers. For example, Albert is aware of the company\u2019s intention to acquire a medical supply company in the coming weeks.<br>With his forward thinking, Albert hopes to convince the managers who will be interviewing him that he is right for the job.<br>Based on Albert\u2019s observations, executive leadership should most likely pay closer attention to what?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Penny has recently joined Ace Space, a company that sells homeware accessories online, as its new privacy officer. The company is based in California but thanks to some great publicity from a social media influencer last year, the company has received an influx of sales from the EU and has set up a regional office in Ireland to support this expansion. To become familiar with Ace Space\u2019s practices and assess what her privacy priorities will be, Penny has set up meetings with a number of colleagues to hear about the work that they have been doing and their compliance efforts.<br>Penny\u2019s colleague in Marketing is excited by the new sales and the company\u2019s plans, but is also concerned that Penny may curtail some of the growth opportunities he has planned. He tells her \u201cI heard someone in the breakroom talking about some new privacy laws but I really don\u2019t think it affects us. We\u2019re just a small company. I mean we just sell accessories online, so what\u2019s the real risk?\u201d He has also told her that he works with a number of small companies that help him get projects completed in a hurry. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to meet our deadlines otherwise we lose money. I just sign the contracts and get Jim in finance to push through the payment. Reviewing the contracts takes time that we just don\u2019t have.\u201d<br>In her meeting with a member of the IT team, Penny has learned that although Ace Space has taken a number of precautions to protect its website from malicious activity, it has not taken the same level of care of its physical files or internal infrastructure. Penny\u2019s colleague in IT has told her that a former employee lost an encrypted USB key with financial data on it when he left. The company nearly lost access to their customer database last year after they fell victim to a phishing attack. Penny is told by her IT colleague that the IT team \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do or who should do what. We hadn\u2019t been trained on it but we\u2019re a small team though, so it worked out OK in the end.\u201d Penny is concerned that these issues will compromise Ace Space\u2019s privacy and data protection.<br>Penny is aware that the company has solid plans to grow its international sales and will be working closely with the CEO to give the organization a data \u201cshake up\u201d. Her mission is to cultivate a strong privacy culture within the company.<br>Penny has a meeting with Ace Space\u2019s CEO today and has been asked to give her first impressions and an overview of her next steps.<br>To help Penny and her CEO with their objectives, what would be the most helpful approach to address her IT concerns?",

This can help highlight any gaps in the response process.\nTraining: Since Penny's IT colleague mentioned they \"didn\u2019t know what to do or who should do what\" during a previous phishing attack, a tabletop exercise would serve as an effective training tool, giving the team clarity on roles, responsibilities, and actions to take during an incident.\nBuilding Confidence: By running through these simulations, the IT team can become more confident in their abilities to handle real-world situations when they arise.\nWhile the other options are valid in their own contexts, given the specific concerns Penny has learned about Ace Space's IT practices, the tabletop exercise directly addresses the identified issues and provides the most immediate benefits."

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>For 15 years, Albert has worked at Treasure Box \u2013 a mail order company in the United States (U.S.) that used to sell decorative candles around the world, but has recently decided to limit its shipments to customers in the 48 contiguous states. Despite his years of experience, Albert is often overlooked for managerial positions. His frustration about not being promoted, coupled with his recent interest in issues of privacy protection, have motivated Albert to be an agent of positive change.<br>He will soon interview for a newly advertised position, and during the interview, Albert plans on making executives aware of lapses in the company\u2019s privacy program. He feels certain he will be rewarded with a promotion for preventing negative consequences resulting from the company\u2019s outdated policies and procedures.<br>For example, Albert has learned about the AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountans)/CICA (Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants) Privacy Maturity Model (PMM). Albert thinks the model is a useful way to measure Treasure Box\u2019s ability to protect personal data. Albert has noticed that Treasure Box fails to meet the requirements of the highest level of maturity of this model; at his interview, Albert will pledge to assist the company with meeting this level in order to provide customers with the most rigorous security available.<br>Albert does want to show a positive outlook during his interview. He intends to praise the company\u2019s commitment to the security of customer and employee personal data against external threats. However, Albert worries about the high turnover rate within the company, particularly in the area of direct phone marketing. He sees many unfamiliar faces every day who are hired to do the marketing, and he often hears complaints in the lunch room regarding long hours and low pay, as well as what seems to be flagrant disregard for company procedures.<br>In addition, Treasure Box has had two recent security incidents. The company has responded to the incidents with internal audits and updates to security safeguards. However, profits still seem to be affected and anecdotal evidence indicates that many people still harbor mistrust. Albert wants to help the company recover. He knows there is at least one incident the public in unaware of, although Albert does not know the details. He believes the company\u2019s insistence on keeping the incident a secret could be a further detriment to its reputation. One further way that Albert wants to help Treasure Box regain its stature is by creating a toll-free number for customers, as well as a more efficient procedure for responding to customer concerns by postal mail.<br>In addition to his suggestions for improvement, Albert believes that his knowledge of the company\u2019s recent business maneuvers will also impress the interviewers. For example, Albert is aware of the company\u2019s intention to acquire a medical supply company in the coming weeks.<br>With his forward thinking, Albert hopes to convince the managers who will be interviewing him that he is right for the job.<br>The company may start to earn back the trust of its customer base by following Albert\u2019s suggestion regarding which handling procedure?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>You lead the privacy office for a company that handles information from individuals living in several countries throughout Europe and the Americas. You begin that morning\u2019s privacy review when a contracts officer sends you a message asking for a phone call. The message lacks clarity and detail, but you presume that data was lost.<br>When you contact the contracts officer, he tells you that he received a letter in the mail from a vendor stating that the vendor improperly shared information about your customers. He called the vendor and confirmed that your company recently surveyed exactly 2000 individuals about their most recent healthcare experience and sent those surveys to the vendor to transcribe it into a database, but the vendor forgot to encrypt the database as promised in the contract. As a result, the vendor has lost control of the data.<br>The vendor is extremely apologetic and offers to take responsibility for sending out the notifications. They tell you they set aside 2000 stamped postcards because that should reduce the time it takes to get the notice in the mail. One side is limited to their logo, but the other side is blank and they will accept whatever you want to write. You put their offer on hold and begin to develop the text around the space constraints. You are content to let the vendor\u2019s logo be associated with the notification.<br>The notification explains that your company recently hired a vendor to store information about their most recent experience at St. Sebastian Hospital\u2019s Clinic for Infectious Diseases. The vendor did not encrypt the information and no longer has control of it. All 2000 affected individuals are invited to sign-up for email notifications about their information. They simply need to go to your company\u2019s website and watch a quick advertisement, then provide their name, email address, and month and year of birth.<br>You email the incident-response council for their buy-in before 9 a.m. If anything goes wrong in this situation, you want to diffuse the blame across your colleagues. Over the next eight hours, everyone emails their comments back and forth. The consultant who leads the incident-response team notes that it is his first day with the company, but he has been in other industries for 45 years and will do his best. One of the three lawyers on the council causes the conversation to veer off course, but it eventually gets back on track. At the end of the day, they vote to proceed with the notification you wrote and use the vendor\u2019s postcards.<br>Shortly after the vendor mails the postcards, you learn the data was on a server that was stolen, and make the decision to have your company offer credit monitoring services. A quick internet search finds a credit monitoring company with a convincing name: Credit Under Lock and Key (CRUDLOK). Your sales rep has never handled a contract for 2000 people, but develops a proposal in about a day which says CRUDLOK will:<br>Send an enrollment invitation to everyone the day after the contract is signed.<br>Enroll someone with just their first name and the last-4 of their national identifier.<br>Monitor each enrollee\u2019s credit for two years from the date of enrollment.<br>Send a monthly email with their credit rating and offers for credit-related services at market rates.<br>Charge your company 20% of the cost of any credit restoration.<br>You execute the contract and the enrollment invitations are emailed to the 2000 individuals.

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>You lead the privacy office for a company that handles information from individuals living in several countries throughout Europe and the Americas. You begin that morning\u2019s privacy review when a contracts officer sends you a message asking for a phone call. The message lacks clarity and detail, but you presume that data was lost.<br>When you contact the contracts officer, he tells you that he received a letter in the mail from a vendor stating that the vendor improperly shared information about your customers. He called the vendor and confirmed that your company recently surveyed exactly 2000 individuals about their most recent healthcare experience and sent those surveys to the vendor to transcribe it into a database, but the vendor forgot to encrypt the database as promised in the contract. As a result, the vendor has lost control of the data.<br>The vendor is extremely apologetic and offers to take responsibility for sending out the notifications. They tell you they set aside 2000 stamped postcards because that should reduce the time it takes to get the notice in the mail. One side is limited to their logo, but the other side is blank and they will accept whatever you want to write. You put their offer on hold and begin to develop the text around the space constraints. You are content to let the vendor\u2019s logo be associated with the notification.<br>The notification explains that your company recently hired a vendor to store information about their most recent experience at St. Sebastian Hospital\u2019s Clinic for Infectious Diseases. The vendor did not encrypt the information and no longer has control of it. All 2000 affected individuals are invited to sign-up for email notifications about their information. They simply need to go to your company\u2019s website and watch a quick advertisement, then provide their name, email address, and month and year of birth.<br>You email the incident-response council for their buy-in before 9 a.m. If anything goes wrong in this situation, you want to diffuse the blame across your colleagues. Over the next eight hours, everyone emails their comments back and forth. The consultant who leads the incident-response team notes that it is his first day with the company, but he has been in other industries for 45 years and will do his best. One of the three lawyers on the council causes the conversation to veer off course, but it eventually gets back on track. At the end of the day, they vote to proceed with the notification you wrote and use the vendor\u2019s postcards.<br>Shortly after the vendor mails the postcards, you learn the data was on a server that was stolen, and make the decision to have your company offer credit monitoring services. A quick internet search finds a credit monitoring company with a convincing name: Credit Under Lock and Key (CRUDLOK). Your sales rep has never handled a contract for 2000 people, but develops a proposal in about a day which says CRUDLOK will:<br>Send an enrollment invitation to everyone the day after the contract is signed.<br>Enroll someone with just their first name and the last-4 of their national identifier.<br>Monitor each enrollee\u2019s credit for two years from the date of enrollment.<br>Send a monthly email with their credit rating and offers for credit-related services at market rates.<br>Charge your company 20% of the cost of any credit restoration.<br>You execute the contract and the enrollment invitations are emailed to the 2000 individuals. Three days later you sit down and document all that went well and all that could have gone better. You put it in a file to reference the next time an incident occurs.<br>What is the most concerning limitation of the incident-response council?",

Collecting too much information and keeping it for too long\n\nThe scenario mentions that PHT saved user information by default, including sensitive information such as credit card numbers, unless users specifically opted out. This excessive data collection combined with the lack of proper oversight and data retention procedures created a trove of data that was left vulnerable. The fact that PHT's systems and records remained unused and un-accessed in Pacific Suites' digital archives further amplified the risk."

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Martin Brise\u00f1o is the director of human resources at the Canyon City location of the U.S. hotel chain Pacific Suites. In 1998, Brise\u00f1o decided to change the hotel\u2019s on-the-job mentoring model to a standardized training program for employees who were progressing from line positions into supervisory positions. He developed a curriculum comprising a series of lessons, scenarios, and assessments, which was delivered in-person to small groups. Interest in the training increased, leading Brise\u00f1o to work with corporate HR specialists and software engineers to offer the program in an online format. The online program saved the cost of a trainer and allowed participants to work through the material at their own pace.<br>Upon hearing about the success of Brise\u00f1o\u2019s program, Pacific Suites corporate Vice President Maryanne Silva-Hayes expanded the training and offered it company-wide. Employees who completed the program received certification as a Pacific Suites Hospitality Supervisor. By 2001, the program had grown to provide industry-wide training. Personnel at hotels across the country could sign up and pay to take the course online. As the program became increasingly profitable, Pacific Suites developed an offshoot business, Pacific Hospitality Training (PHT). The sole focus of PHT was developing and marketing a variety of online courses and course progressions providing a number of professional certifications in the hospitality industry.<br>By setting up a user account with PHT, course participants could access an information library, sign up for courses, and take end-of-course certification tests. When a user opened a new account, all information was saved by default, including the user\u2019s name, date of birth, contact information, credit card information, employer, and job title. The registration page offered an opt-out choice that users could click to not have their credit card numbers saved. Once a user name and password were established, users could return to check their course status, review and reprint their certifications, and sign up and pay for new courses. Between 2002 and 2008, PHT issued more than 700,000 professional certifications.<br>PHT\u2019s profits declined in 2009 and 2010, the victim of industry downsizing and increased competition from e-learning providers. By 2011, Pacific Suites was out of the online certification business and PHT was dissolved. The training program\u2019s systems and records remained in Pacific Suites\u2019 digital archives, un-accessed and unused. Brise\u00f1o and Silva-Hayes moved on to work for other companies, and there was no plan for handling the archived data after the program ended. After PHT was dissolved, Pacific Suites executives turned their attention to crucial day-to-day operations. They planned to deal with the PHT materials once resources allowed.<br>In 2012, the Pacific Suites computer network was hacked. Malware installed on the online reservation system exposed the credit card information of hundreds of hotel guests. While targeting the financial data on the reservation site, hackers also discovered the archived training course data and registration accounts of Pacific Hospitality Training\u2019s customers. The result of the hack was the exfiltration of the credit card numbers of recent hotel guests and the exfiltration of the PHT database with all its contents.<br>A Pacific Suites systems analyst discovered the information security breach in a routine scan of activity reports. Pacific Suites quickly notified credit card companies and recent hotel guests of the breach, attempting to prevent serious harm. Technical security engineers faced a challenge in dealing with the PHT data.<br>PHT course administrators and the IT engineers did not have a system for tracking, cataloguing, and storing information. Pacific Suites has procedures in place for data access and storage, but those procedures were not implemented when PHT was formed. When the PHT database was acquired by Pacific Suites, it had no owner or oversight. By the time technical security engineers determined what private information was compromised, at least 8,000 credit card holders were potential victims of fraudulent activity.<br>What must Pacific Suite\u2019s primary focus be as it manages this security breach?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question.<br>Manasa is a product manager at Omnipresent Omnimedia, where she is responsible for leading the development of the company\u2019s flagship product, the Handy Helper. The Handy Helper is an application that can be used in the home to manage family calendars, do online shopping, and schedule doctor appointments. After having had a successful launch in the United States, the Handy Helper is about to be made available for purchase worldwide.<br>The packaging and user guide for the Handy Helper indicate that it is a \u201cprivacy friendly\u201d product suitable for the whole family, including children, but does not provide any further detail or privacy notice. In order to use the application, a family creates a single account, and the primary user has access to all information about the other users. Upon start up, the primary user must check a box consenting to receive marketing emails from Omnipresent Omnimedia and selected marketing partners in order to be able to use the application.<br>Sanjay, the head of privacy at Omnipresent Omnimedia, was working on an agreement with a European distributor of Handy Helper when he fielded many questions about the product from the distributor. Sanjay needed to look more closely at the product in order to be able to answer the questions as he was not involved in the product development process.<br>In speaking with the product team, he learned that the Handy Helper collected and stored all of a user\u2019s sensitive medical information for the medical appointment scheduler. In fact, all of the user\u2019s information is stored by Handy Helper for the additional purpose of creating additional products and to analyze usage of the product. This data is all stored in the cloud and is encrypted both during transmission and at rest.<br>Consistent with the CEO\u2019s philosophy that great new product ideas can come from anyone, all Omnipresent Omnimedia employees have access to user data under a program called \u201cEureka.\u201d Omnipresent Omnimedia is hoping that at some point in the future, the data will reveal insights that could be used to create a fully automated application that runs on artificial intelligence, but as of yet, Eureka is not well-defined and is considered a long-term goal.<br>What security controls are missing from the Eureka program?",

I mean we just sell accessories online, so what\u2019s the real risk?\u201d He has also told her that he works with a number of small companies that help him get projects completed in a hurry. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to meet our deadlines otherwise we lose money. I just sign the contracts and get Jim in finance to push through the payment. Reviewing the contracts takes time that we just don\u2019t have.\u201d<br>In her meeting with a member of the IT team, Penny has learned that although Ace Space has taken a number of precautions to protect its website from malicious activity, it has not taken the same level of care of its physical files or internal infrastructure. Penny\u2019s colleague in IT has told her that a former employee lost an encrypted USB key with financial data on it when he left.

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Your organization, the Chicago (U.S.)-based Society for Urban Greenspace, has used the same vendor to operate all aspects of an online store for several years. As a small nonprofit, the Society cannot afford the higher-priced options, but you have been relatively satisfied with this budget vendor, Shopping Cart Saver (SCS). Yes, there have been some issues. Twice, people who purchased items from the store have had their credit card information used fraudulently subsequent to transactions on your site, but in neither case did the investigation reveal with certainty that the Society\u2019s store had been hacked. The thefts could have been employee-related.<br>Just as disconcerting was an incident where the organization discovered that SCS had sold information it had collected from customers to third parties. However, as Jason Roland, your SCS account representative, points out, it took only a phone call from you to clarify expectations and the \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d has not occurred again.<br>As an information-technology program manager with the Society, the role of the privacy professional is only one of many you play. In all matters, however, you must consider the financial bottom line. While these problems with privacy protection have been significant, the additional revenues of sales of items such as shirts and coffee cups from the store have been significant. The Society\u2019s operating budget is slim, and all sources of revenue are essential.<br>Now a new challenge has arisen. Jason called to say that starting in two weeks, the customer data from the store would now be stored on a data cloud. \u201cThe good news,\u201d he says, \u201cis that we have found a low-cost provider in Finland, where the data would also be held. So, while there may be a small charge to pass through to you, it won\u2019t be exorbitant, especially considering the advantages of a cloud.\u201d<br>You begin to research and discover that a number of the leading cloud service providers have signed a letter of intent to work together on shared conventions and technologies for privacy protection. You make a note to find out if Jason\u2019s Finnish provider is signing on.<br>If the vendor's actions raise concerns about privacy protection, what action should you take first?",

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br>Penny has recently joined Ace Space, a company that sells homeware accessories online, as its new privacy officer. The company is based in California but thanks to some great publicity from a social media influencer last year, the company has received an influx of sales from the EU and has set up a regional office in Ireland to support this expansion. To become familiar with Ace Space\u2019s practices and assess what her privacy priorities will be, Penny has set up meetings with a number of colleagues to hear about the work that they have been doing and their compliance efforts.<br>Penny\u2019s colleague in Marketing is excited by the new sales and the company\u2019s plans, but is also concerned that Penny may curtail some of the growth opportunities he has planned. He tells her \u201cI heard someone in the breakroom talking about some new privacy laws but I really don\u2019t think it affects us. We\u2019re just a small company. I mean we just sell accessories online, so what\u2019s the real risk?\u201d He has also told her that he works with a number of small companies that help him get projects completed in a hurry. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to meet our deadlines otherwise we lose money. I just sign the contracts and get Jim in finance to push through the payment. Reviewing the contracts takes time that we just don\u2019t have.\u201d<br>In her meeting with a member of the IT team, Penny has learned that although Ace Space has taken a number of precautions to protect its website from malicious activity, it has not taken the same level of care of its physical files or internal infrastructure. Penny\u2019s colleague in IT has told her that a former employee lost an encrypted USB key with financial data on it when he left. The company nearly lost access to their customer database last year after they fell victim to a phishing attack. Penny is told by her IT colleague that the IT team \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do or who should do what. We hadn\u2019t been trained on it but we\u2019re a small team though, so it worked out OK in the end.\u201d Penny is concerned that these issues will compromise Ace Space\u2019s privacy and data protection.<br>Penny is aware that the company has solid plans to grow its international sales and will be working closely with the CEO to give the organization a data \u201cshake up\u201d. Her mission is to cultivate a strong privacy culture within the company.<br>Penny has a meeting with Ace Space\u2019s CEO today and has been asked to give her first impressions and an overview of her next steps.<br>To help Penny and her CEO with their objectives, what would be the most helpful approach to address her IT concerns?",

I am so glad you have jumped right into your new position as our in-house privacy professional. BastTech greatly needs your expertise. I hope you are comfortably settling into your new home in the United States after your move from the United Kingdom! Georgia is a wonderful state.<br>I particularly appreciate your enthusiasm in using your recent informal assessment to begin rectifying gaps in our privacy program and making sure we are in compliance with all laws. However, I also want to make sure that we are prioritizing our initiatives by spending time on the measures that are most important to our customers, our company, and the tech industry as a whole.<br>Specifically, I know that you are advocating for an update of our Business Continuity Disaster Response (BCDR) plan with an eye toward privacy concerns. I think this effort is something that we may be able to postpone. I'm sure that after ten years the document can be updated in spots; however, we have first-rate, experienced executive leaders that would have things well in hand in the unlikely event of a disaster.<br>Further, you mentioned that you would like to assess our longtime subcontractor's disaster plan through a second-party audit. Papyrus, our longtime subcontractor, does keep a great deal of personal data about our customers. However, I am not sure I understand your request and would like to discuss this further during our meeting Wednesday.<br>You also say that your audit uncovered some inadequacies in staff compliance with our security procedures and local laws. I just wanted to emphasize that the audit findings only need to be communicated to the executive leadership. I would rather not cause unnecessary alarm across departments.<br>I know you are also looking closely at the recent loss of a file belonging to a staff member in Human Resources (HR). It was an unfortunate incident, but rest assured, we handled the situation according to Georgia state law. The only difficult part was easing the concerns of our many remote employees all across the country whose data was on the computer. But I believe everything is settled. At least this stands as proof that in the event of another breach of any type, Information Security (IS) will take the lead while other departments move on with business as usual without having to get involved. Thankfully, we have taken the measure of supplementing our General Commercial Liability Insurance with cyber insurance.<br>Anyway, we will talk more on Wednesday. I just wanted to communicate some of my current thinking.<br>Thanks,<br><br>Whitney -<br>Interim Assistant Business Manager, BastTech.<br>Based on the email, what should Zoe suggest to Whitney regarding the informal audit?",

Felicity has taken several notes on ways she believes the company can spend less money trying to uphold its privacy mission. First, Felicity intends to discuss the size of the company's information security budget with Jin. Felicity proposes to streamline information security by putting it solely within the purview of the company's Information Technology (IT) experts, since personal data within the company is stored electronically.<br>She is also perplexed by the Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) Jin facilitated at some of the company's locations. Jin carefully documented the approximate amount of man-hours the PIAs took to complete, and Felicity is astounded at the amount. She cannot understand why so much time has been spent on sporadic PIAs.<br>Felicity has also recently received complaints from employees, including mid-level managers, about the great burden of paperwork necessary for documenting employee compliance with the company's privacy policy. She hopes Jin can propose cheaper, more efficient ways of monitoring compliance. In Felicity's view, further evidence of Jin's overzealousness is his insistence on monitoring third-party processors for their observance of the company's privacy policy. New staff members seem especially overwhelmed. Despite the consistent monitoring, two years ago the company had to pay remediation costs after a security breach of a processor's data system. Felicity wonders whether processors can be held contractually liable for the costs of any future breaches.<br>Last in Felicity's notes is a reminder to discuss Jin's previous praise for the company's independent ethics function within the Human Resources (HR) department. Felicity believes that much company time could be saved if the Ethics Officer position were done away with, and that any ethical concerns were simply brought directly to the executive leadership of the company.<br>Although Felicity questions many of Jin's decisions, she hopes that their meeting will be productive and that Jin, who is widely respected throughout the company, will help the company save money.

Metadata can be seen as less direct or \"visible\" to the data subject, and while it's often important to manage and protect this appropriately, it might not always be a mandatory element to include in a data collection notice."

You also learn that InStyle Data Corp.'s privacy and information security teams are not informed of new personal data flows, new products developed by InStyle Data Corp. that process personal data, or updates to existing InStyle Data Corp. products that may change what or how the personal data is processed until after the product or update has gone live.<br><br>Through a review of InStyle Data Corp\u2019 test and development environment logs, you discover InStyle Data Corp. sometimes gives login credentials to any InStyle Data Corp. employee or contractor who requests them. The test environment only contains dummy data, but the development environment contains personal data, including Social Security Numbers, health information, and financial information. All credentialed InStyle Data Corp. employees and contractors have the ability to alter and delete personal data in both environments regardless of their role or what project they are working on.<br><br>You and your partner provide a gap assessment citing the issues you spotted, along with recommended remedial actions and a method to measure implementation. InStyle Data Corp. implements all of the recommended security controls. You review the processes, roles, controls, and measures taken to appropriately protect the personal data at every step. However, you realize there is no plan for monitoring and nothing in place addressing sanctions for violations of the updated policies and procedures.

Subscribe to mailing lists that report on regulatory changes.\nHere's why:\nAccessibility: Mailing lists often provide concise summaries of regulatory changes, making it easy for the DPO to stay informed without dedicating excessive time to research.\nCost-effective: Subscription fees for mailing lists are typically minimal compared to other options.\nTargeted information: Many mailing lists allow subscribers to customize their preferences, ensuring that the DPO receives only the most relevant updates.\nTime-saving: By subscribing to mailing lists, the DPO can avoid the time-consuming process of manually searching for regulatory updates.\nWhile engaging an external lawyer or attending workshops can be beneficial, these options may be more costly and time-consuming, especially for a growing company with limited resources. Regularly engaging regulators might also be challenging, as they may not have the time or resources to provide ongoing updates."

    "body": "SCENARIO -<br>Please use the following to answer the next question:<br><br>Liam is the newly appointed IT Compliance Manager at Mesa, a US-based outdoor clothing brand with a global E-commerce presence. During his second week, he is contacted by the company's IT Audit Manager, who informs him that the auditing team will be conducting a review of Mesa's privacy compliance risk in a month.<br><br>A bit nervous about the audit, Liam asks his boss what his predecessor had completed related to privacy compliance before leaving the company. Liam is told that a consent management tool had been added to the website and they commissioned a privacy risk evaluation from a small consulting firm last year that determined that their risk exposure was relatively low given their current control environment. After reading the consultant's report, Liam realized that the scope of the assessment was limited to breach notification laws in the US and the Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).<br><br>Not wanting to let down his new team, Liam kept his concerns about the report to himself and figured he could try to put some additional controls into place before the audit. Having some privacy compliance experience in his last role, Liam thought he might start by having discussions with the E-commerce and marketing teams.<br><br>The E-commerce Director informed him that they were still using the cookie consent tool forcibly placed on the home screen by the CIO, but could not understand the point since their office was not located in California or Europe. The Marketing Director touted his department's success with purchasing email lists and taking a shotgun approach to direct marketing. Both Directors highlighted their tracking tools on the website to enhance customer experience while learning more about where else the customer had shopped. The more people Liam met with, the more it became apparent that privacy awareness and the general control environment at Mesa needed help.<br><br>With three weeks before the audit, Liam updated Mesa\u2019s Privacy Notice himself, which was taken and revised from a competitor's website. He also wrote policies and procedures outlining the roles and responsibilities for privacy within Mesa and distributed the document to all departments he knew of with access to personal information.<br><br>During this time, Liam also filled the backlog of data subject requests for deletion that had been sent to him by the Customer Service Manager. Liam worked with application owners to remove these individual's information and order history from the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), the data warehouse, and the email server.<br><br>At the audit kick-off meeting, Liam explained to his boss and her team that there may still be some room for improvement, but he thought the risk had been mitigated to an appropriate level based on the work he had done thus far.<br><br>After the audit had been completed, the Audit Manager and Liam met to discuss her team's findings, and much to his dismay, Liam was told that none of the work he had completed prior to the audit followed best practices for governance and risk mitigation. In fact, his actions only opened the company up to additional risk and scrutiny. Based on these findings, Liam worked with external counsel and an established privacy consultant to develop a remediation plan.<br><br>The phases of an audit described in this narrative are Plan and ?",

The company has been trading for over 25 years and you soon team that so far, the company has done little to control the use of customer information.<br><br>During the first few weeks you establish that despite attempts by your predecessor, the company has held onto all customer records digitally in various systems, including their customer records management system, their invoicing system, their call recording system, their marketing database and within two different email clients.<br><br>There have been a fair number of minor data breaches in recent months and a couple of larger ones, which have meant that not only has the company's reputation been damaged but they have also had to report some of the bigger breaches to the regulator. One of these breaches led to the credit risk scores of over 150,000 customers being deliberately leaked to the company\u2019s largest competitor.<br><br>You also discover that some customers have asked for their data to be deleted following a number of marketing campaigns. Even though the company has told the customers that they have done what was asked, you team that all the company did was remove these customers from their marketing lists - in other words, all their data is still in the various digital systems for marketing, invoicing and records management.<br><br>On top of all this, you learn that if a customer service agent based in the energy corporation's US call center cannot find the details of the specific customer they are talking to on the phone, the agent will just add notes of the telephone conversation in whichever customer record the agent can find. What this means is that some customer records are very inaccurate, and this causes delays in compensation payments, poor reviews on independent review sites and the energy regulator in the UK is thinking of suspending the company's license.<br><br>As artificial intelligence is seen as the new energy future linking to the Internet of Things (IoT), the company has partnered with another company specializing in ingesting huge amounts of data into cloud-based warehouses. This data is then used to profile customers, so they get an idea of which ones are most likely to buy their new cutting-edge technology that is being offered via their new business partner. Many of the new devices on offer mean that both companies will be able to gather even more data about their customers, including geo-location, IP addresses, which electrical devices their customers use in their homes and when they use them the most.<br><br>The company is very excited for the future and how all this new tech can help them beat the competition but you have a big task ahead of you to get things right with their privacy program.<br><br>Following the marketing campaigns, which of the following should have been prioritized by the company?",
