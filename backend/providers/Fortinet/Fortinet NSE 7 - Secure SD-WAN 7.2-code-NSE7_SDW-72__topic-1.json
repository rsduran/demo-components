The administrator wants BGP to advertise prefixes from spokes to other spokes over the IPsec overlays, including additional paths. However, when looking at the spoke routing table, the administrator does not see the prefixes from other spokes and the additional paths.<br>Based on the exhibit, which three settings must the administrator configure inside each BGP neighbor group so spokes can learn other spokes prefixes and their additional paths?

You add the parent tunnel as member, and after the shortcut is negotiated, SD-WAN automatically starts steering the traffic through the shortcut\n\nLets say that the parent interface is called ADVPN and an example of a shortcut will be ADVPN1_0 . You do not add in the zone the ADVPN1_0 as described on choice D you add the parent tunnel.  I am not really sure how all people gave as an answer D as correct. Its a tricky one as they play with words.\n\nC is the correct one.

SD-WAN rules use SLA targets to check if the preferred members meet the SLA requirements.\nSD-WAN rules are designed to ensure that the traffic is routed through the best possible link based on the defined SLA targets. These targets define the acceptable levels of performance, such as latency, jitter, and packet loss. If the preferred member does not meet the SLA requirements, the SD-WAN rule can select an alternative member that meets the criteria.\nC. When configuring an SD-WAN rule, you can select multiple SLA targets of the same performance SLA.\nIn FortiGate, you can configure multiple SLA targets within an SD-WAN rule. This allows the rule to evaluate multiple performance criteria to determine the best link for traffic routing. For example, you can set multiple targets for latency, jitter, and packet loss, and the rule will use these targets to select the optimal path."
