I am a bit conflicted in the choice though, so it needs some further studying to be sure."

The hub must also be configured with set add-route disable, so D is definitely correct. The Study Guide merely states that you have to check and confirm that phase2 selectors are set to 0.0.0.0/0, which is the default setting as stated here  https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.2.4/cli-reference/373620/config-vpn-ipsec-phase2-interface (dst-subnet row in table). I belive if you HAD to set 0.0.0.0/0 the documentation would actually show that in every configuration example of ADVPN. Thus I am going to say that C and D are the correct answers, just to confuse everyone, because I am a bit confused my self."

It typically requires only four messages to establish a secure tunnel in its main exchange:\nIKE_SA_INIT: The first exchange initializes the IKE Security Association (SA) and performs a Diffie-Hellman exchange to generate shared secret keys.\nIKE_AUTH: The second exchange authenticates the parties and establishes the IPsec SA.\n\nIKEv2 supports EAP, which provides a flexible framework for various authentication methods. EAP can be used for user authentication, allowing integration with systems such as RADIUS or other authentication servers, providing a high degree of flexibility in choosing authentication mechanisms."
