This may be necessary if the system is experiencing high levels of traffic or if there are issues with resource utilization.\n\nAdministrators cannot change the configuration: When the system is in conserve mode, administrators may not be able to change the configuration. This is because the system is prioritizing resource conservation over other activities, and making changes to the configuration may require additional resources that are not available.\n\nIt is important to note that FortiGate will not start sending all files to FortiSandbox for inspection, and administrators may still be able to access FortiGate through other means besides the console port."

FGCP runs only over the heartbeat links.\n\nThe FGCP (FortiGate Clustering Protocol) is a protocol that is used to manage high availability (HA) clusters of FortiGate devices. It performs several functions, including the following:\n\nFGCP elects the primary FortiGate device: In an HA cluster, FGCP is used to determine which FortiGate device will be the primary device, responsible for handling traffic and making decisions about what to allow or block. FGCP uses a variety of factors, such as the device's priority, to determine which device should be the primary.\n\nFGCP runs only over the heartbeat links: FGCP communicates between FortiGate devices in the HA cluster using the heartbeat links. These are dedicated links that are used to exchange status and control information between the devices. FGCP does not run over other types of links, such as data links."

Thus destination translation occurs from 10.200.1.1:10443 to 10.0.1.10:443.\n\nThe firewall rule itself also has NAT set to Enabled.

        "content": "In FortiGate Firewall IPS, the \"monitor\" action is used to allow the traffic to pass through the firewall but still monitor it for potential threats or policy violations.\n\nWhen an IPS sensor detects an intrusion attempt or violation of a security policy, it can trigger an alert or log the event, providing information for further analysis or action.\n\nBy using the monitor action instead of the block action, you can allow traffic to continue flowing while still gaining visibility into potential security risks. This can be useful in situations where blocking the traffic might cause operational disruptions or false positives.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the monitor action does not actively block traffic, so it's recommended to use it in conjunction with other security measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion prevention systems, to ensure comprehensive protection against cyber threats."
