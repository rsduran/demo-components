In the context of ZTNA, this usually indicates that there is no matching ZTNA rule or proxy-policy allowing this connection. FortiGate uses ZTNA rules or proxy policies to control access based on the security posture and identity of the user/device.\n\nOption A refers to local-in policies, which control traffic destined for the FortiGate itself. Since this log is about forwarding traffic, local-in policies do not apply.\nOption C and Option D refer to the ZTNA server configuration and firewall policies, but the log specifically mentions the failure is related to the proxy-policy, which is managed via ZTNA rules."
