The problem is that this number changes as the position of the policy in the sequence changes. The column that correctly identifies the policy, and the value sticks with the policy is the \"ID\" column. This column is not shown by default in the listing but can be added to the displayed columns by right clicking on the column heading bar and selecting it from the list of possible columns.\n\nWhen looking in the configuration file the sequence is based upon the order of the policies as they are in the file just as they are in the list in the GUI. However, if you need to edit the policy in the CLI you must use the ID number."

The FortiGate unit challenges the user for a user name and password. It then forwards the user\u2019s credentials to an external RADIUS or LDAP server for verification.\n\nImplementation of XAuth requires configuration at both the FortiGate unit and the FortiClient application.
