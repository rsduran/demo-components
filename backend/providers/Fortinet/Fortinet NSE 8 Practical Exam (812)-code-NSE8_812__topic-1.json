The download bandwidth of 500 Mbps is not\ngreater than 950 Mbps, so the FEC mapping is not overridden by the bandwidth setting. Therefore, the\nFEC behavior will be 2 redundant packets for every 8 base packets.\nHere is the explanation of the FEC mappings in the exhibit:\nPacket loss greater than 10%:\ue6038 base packets and 2 redundant packets.\nUpload bandwidth greater than 950 Mbps:\ue6039 base packets and 3 redundant packets.\nThe mappings are matched from top to bottom, so the first mapping that matches the conditions will be\nused. In this case, the first mapping matches because the packet loss is greater than 10%. Therefore, the\nFEC behavior will be 2 redundant packets for every 8 base packets.\nReference: https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.0.0/new-features/169010/adaptive-\nforward-error-correction-7-0-2"

Clients will have poor reputations if they have been participating in attacks, willingly or otherwise. Because blacklisting innocent clients is equally undesirable, Fortinet also restores the reputations of clients that improve their behavior. This is crucial when an infected computer is cleaned, or in DHCP or PPPoE pools where an innocent client receives an IP address that was previously leased by an attacker."

The same is true for Cisco and Juniper routers. The question should ask \"when routing policy was changed\" - then yes, reconfiguraiton is the way to notify BGP peers that BGP policy was changed. \nAnyway:\n\nGraceful restart - tells BGP neighbors to keep the routes advertised by peer even when peer GOES DOWN, i.e. it contradicts with the question condition that BGP session should not go down.\n\nSynchronization - unrelated at all, refers to the ancient rule that routes advertised/learned via BGP HAVE to be first learned via IGP (like OSPF/IS-IS/etc) to prevent loops in iBGP topology. No one uses it anymore, everyone either disables synchronization or it is disabled (as in FGTs) by default.\n\nDterermenistic MED - is about route preference between EBGP peers, unrelated at all to the question."

So A &amp; C are excluded as not impacting tokens located on the FAC. \n\nSo the D is correct, because this configure IP should always be PUBLIC one that clients on the Internet can reach from their homes/hotels/etc. This is the IP FAC sends to the Forticlient telling him \"Connect to this IP and port\".

Multicast packets are forwarded even when there is no multicast policy or the multicast policy is set to deny.
