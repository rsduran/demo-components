This means that 10.200.1.1 is the gateway.\nWhen my home routers IP address is X and my laptops IP is 192.168.0.100 then traffic from internet to my laptop is destined to X (gateway IP, my router). On the router DNAT replaces X by 192.168.0.100. Same principle here.\n\nSo traffic from some host 10.171.121.38 has destination IP 10.200.1.1 (gateway) and on the GW DNAT replaces 10.200.1.1 by 10.0.1.10 which is the final destination.\n\nNow the questions asks about traffic COMING FROM 10.171.121.38. So it asks to which point is it routed when it initiates from this IP. As explained above, it is routed to 10.200.1.1 where the destination NAT to the final destination 10.0.1.10 happens, so from 10.171.121.38s perspective, and that is what the questions asks for, 10.200.1.1 is the next-hop."
