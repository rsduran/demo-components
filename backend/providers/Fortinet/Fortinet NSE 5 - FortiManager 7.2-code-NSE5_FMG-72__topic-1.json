Depending on the Server Override Mode configuration, you can restrict FortiManager to receiving updates from the configured override servers list, or allowing fallback to other public FDS servers, if FortiManager is not able to communicate and receive updates from the configured server list.\n\nIn the example shown on this slide, two override server addresses are configured. When Server Override Mode is set to Strict, FortiManager gets updates only from these two servers. There is no fallback to other public servers, if these two configured servers are not available.\n\nIf you set Server Override Mode to Loose, FortiManager first tries to get updates from the configured server list; if they are unavailable, FortiManager falls back to other public FDS servers to get updates.\n\nReference [Page 357] - https://ebin.pub/fortinet-fortimanager-study-guide-for-fortimanager-72.html"

During discovery, FortiManager sets the FortiManager NATed IP address on FortiGate.\n\nWhen adding a FortiGate device to FortiManager using the discovery process, and FortiManager is operating behind a NAT device, configuring the FortiManager's NATed IP address in the system administration settings of FortiManager is crucial. This setup ensures that the FortiGate device can communicate with the FortiManager through the NAT device. By providing the NATed IP address of FortiManager, you're essentially telling the FortiGate where to send its management traffic so that it can be properly routed through the NAT device to reach the FortiManager.\n\nThe process does not involve setting the NAT device's IP address on the FortiGate; instead, it utilizes the configured NATed IP address of the FortiManager to establish the management connection. This makes option B the expected result of this configuration scenario."
