The SNI tells FortiGate the hostname of the SSL server, which is validated against the DNS name before receipt of the server certificate.

SSL certificate inspection only inspects the certificate of the encrypted traffic, ensuring it is valid and not self-signed or expired. It does not decrypt the actual content of the SSL/TLS traffic, meaning that any malicious content inside encrypted HTTPS traffic will pass through without being inspected.   So here, we can assume the EICAR file was accessed via HTTPS."

Here's a breakdown of potential causes:\n1.\tInterface in a Zone: If the interface is part of a zone, you cannot configure individual settings, such as DHCP, directly on the interface. FortiGate restricts interface-specific configurations like DHCP when the interface is assigned to a zone.\n2.\tDHCP Relay Configured: If the interface is already configured to act as a DHCP relay (forwarding DHCP requests to an external DHCP server), FortiGate will not allow you to enable the DHCP server on that interface.\nPage 8 of Study Guide"

DNS is usually used by HTTP so that people can use domain names for websites, instead of their IP address. DNS is allowed because it is a base protocol and will most likely be required to initially see proper authentication protocol traffic. Hostname resolution is almost always a requirement for any protocol. However, the DNS service must still be defined in the policy as allowed, in order for it to pass.\n\nA is the correct answer"

If SD-WAN is enabled, you can configure routes with unequal distance and priority values to be part of ECMP is incorrect because ECMP requires routes to have equal cost, which means that the routes must have the same distance and priority values to be considered for load balancing.\n\nIn contrast, ECMP specifically balances traffic across multiple paths that have equal cost, hence the term \"equal-cost\" in ECMP.
