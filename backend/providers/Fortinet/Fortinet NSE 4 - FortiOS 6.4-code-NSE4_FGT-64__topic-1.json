The root FortiGate has control over all the devices in the Security Fabric, and can perform actions on them as needed.\n\nD. Banning or unbanning compromised hosts can also only be performed from the root FortiGate in a Security Fabric. The root FortiGate is responsible for monitoring the Security Fabric and detecting compromised hosts. When a host is detected as compromised, the root FortiGate can ban it from the network to prevent further damage. Similarly, the root FortiGate can unban a previously banned host once it has been cleaned and is no longer a threat."

This is per: https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-FortiGuard-communication/ta-p/197109?externalID=FD46841\nB is correct: The flags for 173.243.138.210 (a default FortiGuard Server IP) show D and I.  \"D\" means this is a default address.  \"I\" means it is the initial server contacted that validated the license, meaning that it didn't have to go on to another. If it had, one of the 173. servers would have a T or an F flag indicating that the connection was failing or had already failed.\nThis is per: https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-FortiGuard-Flags-and-Meanings/ta-p/206725\nThere are no private IP addresses shown, and there is no S flag, so a private FortiManager wasn't used, so A is wrong.\nThe Curr Lost column shows all 0s, so no packets were lost, so C is wrong."

To send a packet over a firewall to determine a failover for the next tunnel after a specific amount of time of not receiving a response from its peer.\nC remember when it comes to choosing a route with regards to Administrative Distance. The route with the lowest distance for that particular route will be chosen. So, by configuring a lower routing distance on the primary tunnel, means that the primary tunnel will be chosen to route packets towards their destination."

Speaking of SNAT, default \"use interface ip address\", and running the same command, shows that some sessions where SNAT is applied might keep source-port intact, its assumed that it will overload and start applying PAT at some point, but it doesn't actually always occur. In fact you can set the policy to preserve source-port, even while configuring dynamic pool with overload and (naturally) one-to-one. C and D can both generate the same output in the end if we can't see the policy configuration... IMHO"

The default is 10 MB. That is \nlarge enough for most files, except video files. If your FortiGate model has more RAM, you may be able to \nincrease this threshold.\nWithout a limit, very large files could exhaust the scan memory. So, this threshold balances risk and \nperformance. Is this tradeoff unique to FortiGate, or to a specific model? No. Regardless of vendor or model, \nyou must make a choice. This is because of the difference between scans in theory, that have no limits, and \nscans on real-world devices, that have finite RAM. In order to detect 100% of malware regardless of file size, \na firewall would need infinitely large RAM\u2014something that no device has in the real world.\nMost viruses are very small. This table shows a typical tradeoff. You can see that with the default 10 MB \nthreshold, only 0.01% of viruses pass through."

Since best match applies, the most specific route will be used to route packets. This \"non-priority\" route is added to provide a \"feasible path\". 'strict-src-check' should be set to 'disable'.\n\n\"strict-src-check disable\" + adding the same route as the best matching one (same subnet, same prefix, same distance) but having a higher priority value than the best match one. This will force the route to be injected in the routing table as a second choice.\n          Note : the lower priority, the best . If not defined, priority is set to '0' per default"
