The following are the requirements of your deployment:<br>* Two FortiGate devices must be deployed; each in a different availability zone.<br>* Each FortiGate requires two virtual network interfaces: one will connect to a public subnet and the other will connect to a private subnet.<br>* An external Microsoft Azure load balancer will distribute ingress traffic to both FortiGate devices in an active-active topology.<br>* An internal Microsoft Azure load balancer will distribute egress traffic from protected virtual machines to both FortiGate devices in an active-active topology.<br>* Traffic should be accepted or denied by a firewall policy in the same way by either FortiGate device in this topology.<br>Which FortiOS CLI configuration can help reduce the administrative effort required to maintain the FortiGate devices, by synchronizing firewall policy and object configuration between the FortiGate devices?<br>",

The FGCP protocol, used in the Active/Passive setup, to sync the configuration is not applicable here. To enable configuration sync between both unit the sync from the autoscaling setup can be used. This will sync all configuration except for the specific configuration item proper to the specific VM like hostname, routing and others. To enable the configuration sync the config below can be used on both.\nhttps://github.com/fortinet/azure-templates/tree/main/FortiGate/Active-Active-ELB-ILB"
