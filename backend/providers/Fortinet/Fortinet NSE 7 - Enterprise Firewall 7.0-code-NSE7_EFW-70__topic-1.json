If flow or proxy inspection is done, then the first digit will be different from 0.\nThe second digit is the client-side state. The table above correlates the second-digit value with the different TCP session states. For example, when FortiGate receives the SYN packet, the second digit is 2. It changes to 3 when the SYN/ACK packet is received.
