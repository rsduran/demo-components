This have a bad detection rate and can make packets be dropped in the wireless network, but half-asses the monitoring requirement. The point is yeah, background scanning allows for clients to connect to the wireless. Using a dedicated radio does not, it performs foreground scans and that is all it does.\n\nC) is correct because, according to page 177, background scanning is automatic if DARRP is enabled.\n\nB) is not correct because if the radio is configured for background scanning, it can not suppress the rogue AP. Fortinet pretty much says they even can't detect rogue APs while in this mode, so supressing is out of the question. In page 180 it says \"Supressing Rogue APs Requires dedicated monitor mode - Not possible with background scans\"\n\nD is not correct because, as I understand according to page 177, it checks for all channels every 20 ms, not just for the ones it has configured."
