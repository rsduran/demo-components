In this example, the FortiGate creates conduits that stop threats from propagating between ICS network 1 and ICS network 2. Expanding on this concept, by placing FortiGate devices at strategic points within the IS network itself, you can granularly segment different zones creating an extra layer of protection for the endpoints and controllers as well as protect the data flow and communications between them. FortiGate has specific ICS and SCADA-aware\nfunctionality, and can identify and police most of the common ICS and SCADA protocols. In parallel to this specific protocol support, additional vulnerability protection is provided for applications and devices from the major ICS manufacturers through a set of signatures."
