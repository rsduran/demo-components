Licenses are shared among sites.\n\nHere's an explanation for each:\n\nA. It provides granular access and segmentation: Multi-tenancy mode allows for the creation of separate tenant accounts or groups within FortiClient EMS. Each tenant can have their own set of policies, configurations, and access rights, providing granular control and segmentation. This enables organizations to manage multiple sites or customer deployments separately within a single FortiClient EMS instance.\n\nC. Licenses are shared among sites: In multi-tenancy mode, licenses can be shared among the different tenant accounts or sites within FortiClient EMS. This means that a pool of licenses can be allocated and utilized across multiple sites or deployments as needed. It helps optimize license utilization and reduces the need for individual licenses for each site or customer."
