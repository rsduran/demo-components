The event viewer logs contain information about user logins, logouts, and other authentication events.\n\nThe FSSO collector agent is not required in agentless polling mode, as FortiGate directly reads the event viewer logs from the DCs. This reduces the configuration complexity and overhead associated with deploying a collector agent on the network.\n\nFortiGate uses the collected authentication information to apply security policies and provide user-based reporting. This allows Fortinet devices to enforce granular policies based on user identity, rather than just IP addresses."

The NetSessionEnum function is used to track user logouts: YES its tracks user login AND logouts.\nSo, I\u2019m still not sure how to answer this. A is strictly correct, but the infrastructure guide does not mention anything about bandwidth, only something about poll interval times. B is also correct because NetAPI uses NetSessionEnum end can track user logouts. But \u201cfunction is used to track user logouts\u201d suggests it\u2019s only used for this.

When a FortiGate device joins or leaves the cluster, the virtual IP address associated with the cluster may change. The virtual IP address is assigned to the primary device in the cluster, and if that device fails, the virtual IP address will failover to the secondary device.\n\nC. Virtual IP addresses are used to distinguish between cluster members. Each device in the cluster has a unique physical IP address, but they share a virtual IP address that is used by clients to communicate with the cluster as a whole. The virtual IP address is used to identify the cluster, and clients use it to connect to the cluster rather than connecting to a specific device."
