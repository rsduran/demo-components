El enrutamiento basado en software se realiza cuando FortiSwitch usa las rutas en la FIB, que se cargan en el n\u00facleo.\n\nEn el ejemplo que se muestra en esta diapositiva, la primera ruta de la tabla, que es una ruta est\u00e1tica predeterminada con una distancia de\n220, no est\u00e1 instalada en la FIB porque FortiSwitch prefiri\u00f3 la ruta predeterminada aprendida a trav\u00e9s de OSPF, que\ntiene una distancia menor (110). Sin embargo, la ruta est\u00e1tica permanece en espera y se instala en la FIB si se elimina la ruta\nOSPF"
