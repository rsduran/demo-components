This allows LDAP users to log in without having to create local accounts on FortiAnalyzer.\n\nA local wildcard administrator account (A): The wildcard administrator account allows any user authenticated through the LDAP server to log in as an administrator without creating individual admin accounts.

        "content": "B,C and D\nRAID 1 consists of an exact copy of a set of data on two (most common) or more disks. Read performance \nand reliability are the main goals. Write performance is not increased because data needs to be mirrored to \nall disks. RAID 1 includes fault tolerance, so if one disk fails the other one can keep working since it \ncontains a complete copy of the data.\n\u2022 RAID 5 consists of block-level striping with distributed parity. Data and parity are striped across three or \nmore disks. This RAID level provides better performance than mirroring as well as fault tolerance. It can \nwithstand the failure of a single drive, as subsequent reads can be calculated from the distributed parity, so \nthat no data is lost.\nRAID 60 combines block-level striping of RAID 0 with the distributed double parity of RAID 6. Write \nperformance is affected, but the enhanced redundancy provides peace of mind. Dual parity allows the \nfailure of two disks in each RAID 6 array.\nFortiAnalyzer 7.4 Administrator Study Guide 127 and 128"
