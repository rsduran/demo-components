First of all C/D are not correct since the customer cannot make changes to global policies due to him not having access rights based on the description.\nGlobal policies are in the GLOBAL ADOM and there they can be assigned to one (or more) ADOMs.  So the correct answer is that inside the GLOBAL ADOM you can unassign the global policy from the myADOM stated in the text.  Both A and B could be read that way but B sounds more specific to the GLOBAL ADOM while A sounds like you could remove a global policy assignment within an ADOM which is not possible."

If you enabled workspace mode, you need to lock the adom first, before attempting to delete the address object.\n\nHowever, in B, the way it is written makes me doubt.
