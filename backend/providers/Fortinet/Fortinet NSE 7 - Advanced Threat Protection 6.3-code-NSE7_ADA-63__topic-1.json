This enhances visibility and simplifies the detection and response process.\n\nD. Reduce human error: FortiSOAR automates repetitive tasks and workflows, reducing the chances of human error in the security operations process. By automating routine tasks, it frees up analysts to focus on more critical security issues.\n\nE. Address analyst skills gap: FortiSOAR can provide guidance, playbooks, and automation that help bridge the gap between junior and senior analysts. By standardizing processes and providing support for less experienced analysts, it can improve overall effectiveness and efficiency in the SOC."
