This suggests that while FortiGate CNF does automate the creation of an S3 bucket, there is no direct mention of this feature in a standard HA deployment scenario."

For A-A clusters, FortiGate must perform SNAT inbound to ensure symmetric traffic flow.\n\n    In an active-active cluster, traffic distribution is split between multiple FortiGate units. To maintain symmetric traffic flow across the units, Source NAT (SNAT) must be used. This ensures that the return traffic follows the same path as the inbound traffic.\n\nc. A-A clusters always require a load balancer.\n\n    Active-active clusters need a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple active FortiGate units to ensure they both process traffic simultaneously. The load balancer helps manage traffic across both active devices in the cluster.\n\nThe other options are less accurate:\n\n    b. API calls are primarily involved in managing failovers for active-passive (A-P) clusters, not active-active.\n    d.

Unicast FortiGate Clustering Protocol (FGCP) must be used.\n\nWhen deploying an active-passive high availability (HA) cluster in AWS, it is important to use Unicast FGCP, which is specifically designed for cloud environments like AWS. FGCP manages the heartbeat communication between FortiGate instances in the cluster and ensures proper failover mechanisms are in place.\n\nHere\u2019s why the other options are less relevant:\n\n    A: Both cluster members do not need to be in the same availability zone; in fact, deploying in different AZs is typically recommended for redundancy.\n    B: VDOM exceptions are not specifically required for HA deployment or traffic flow.\n    D: While health checks are important in general, FortiGate HA clusters do not rely on the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for managing failovers, as FGCP handles this internally."
