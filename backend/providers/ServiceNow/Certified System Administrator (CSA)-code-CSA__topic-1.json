An extended table is a custom database table that is created by extending an existing base table in the platform. When you create an extended table, you can specify which fields from the base table you want to include in the new table, as well as any additional fields that are specific to the extended table.\n\nYou can use dictionary overrides to modify the properties of fields in an extended table in much the same way as you would for fields in a base table. For example, you might use a dictionary override to change the label or description of a field, or to specify a default value or a custom picker for that field.\n\nIt is important to note that dictionary overrides apply to the specific field that they are defined for, and do not affect other fields in the same table or in related tables. So if you want to modify the properties of multiple fields in an extended table, you will need to create separate dictionary overrides for each field."

It allows customers to update or modify the metadata (dictionary) of a specific table in a ServiceNow instance, even if that table has been customized by the instance owner. This allows for greater flexibility in customization and ensures that customer updates can be easily managed and tracked.\n\nIn simple terms, a Dictionary Override occurs when a customer updates the metadata of a table in a ServiceNow instance that has already been customized by the instance owner. The customer update is stored separately from the instance owner's customization, and can be easily identified and managed."

Import Set Tables provide a temporary holding area for records imported from a data source such as a CSV file, an Excel file, or a database table. Once the records are imported into the Import Set Table, they can be transformed and then moved to the appropriate ServiceNow table. The Import Set Table is typically used in conjunction with Transform Maps, which define how the imported data is transformed and mapped to ServiceNow tables"

Transform Data\n\nExplanation:\n\nTransform Data (Option B): The transformation process is often the initial step when importing data into ServiceNow. During this step, data is mapped and transformed to match the structure of the target tables in the ServiceNow instance.\nThe other options do play roles in the data import process:\n\nCoalesce Data (Option A): Coalescing is often done during the transformation process to combine or merge data from different sources.\n\nImport Data (Option C): After transformation, the import process is executed to load the data into the target tables.\n\nLoad Data (Option D): While not a specific module or step, the loading of data is part of the overall import process and typically follows the transformation and mapping steps."

This allows user and group data to be imported into ServiceNow from an LDAP directory.\n\nC.

Is it a typo for \"Return TO the instance\" (the original one) ? \n- \"Return TO the instance\" to me would definitely mean answering \"End Impersonation\"\n- \"Return THE instance\" could mean anything (unless it's a specific technical term). And it could, in this case, be answer D.\n\nI did choose \"End Impersonation\", but I was really hesitating. I passed the exam, but am not sure at all what the correct answer was to this question.\n\nSpeaking of which - this exam was way easier than the first one which I failed. I failed on Nov 17, not sure what happened then but I got questions that I have never seen or thought of."

By analyzing the CI Health Dashboard, agents can gain insights into the affected CIs and their current status, enabling them to trace the impact of issues on the supporting CIs of a service.\n\nWhile the CI Dependency View provides a visual representation of CI relationships, it may not directly provide real-time information about active issues or incidents associated with specific CIs. It focuses more on understanding the connectivity and dependencies between CIs."
