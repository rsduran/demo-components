A task is automatically created for the stockroom manager or, if Procurement is active, purchase order and a purchase order line item are created.

When the quantity falls below a specified threshold, the stock rule triggers an automatic transfer of assets from another stockroom to ensure an adequate supply.\n\nC. To send notifications when a low quantity threshold is detected in a stockroom: Stock rules can also be used to send notifications or alerts when the quantity of assets in a stockroom reaches a predefined low threshold.

These expenses include maintenance, support, upgrades, training, licensing renewals, and any other costs associated with the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the item.\n\nTherefore, the two components included in the total cost of ownership (TCO) are:\n\n   B.
