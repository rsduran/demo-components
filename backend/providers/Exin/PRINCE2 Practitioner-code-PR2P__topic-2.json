    "body": "Scenario -<br><br>Additional Information -<br>During the initiation stage the Project Manager met with the Marketing Director to find out more about the requirements of the promotional calendar and recorded the following notes:<br>There has been a reduction in the order numbers at the MNO Manufacturing due in part to the increased marketing activities of its competitors. 10% of customers have not re-ordered in this financial year and staff morale is poor. A number of skilled staff have left as a result and replacement staff have not been recruited due to the reduced operation. If the project is successful, a recruitment campaign will be required to fill the existing staff vacancies and there may be a requirement for additional staff. Operational costs are likely to increase because skilled staff are expensive and difficult to find.<br><br>In financial terms, there were a total of 1,500 orders in the last financial year, each with an average profit of<br>2k. The Marketing department believes that sending<br>a promotional calendar to our current and prospective customers would increase orders by at least 10% with a minimum of 10 further orders from the list of prospective customers within 12 months from the date of distribution.<br>The Marketing Director will be funding the project from the business marketing budget. She believes that the effect of a good company image portrayed by a successful calendar would last into a second year. She has forecast the same increase in orders for a second year and predicts that the annual employee satisfaction survey will show a measurable improvement in staff morale.<br>A number of alternatives were explored, including:<br>\u2711 20% discount for all repeat customers - not cost-effective and very short term<br>\u2711 A promotional calendar as a free Christmas gift - would target current and prospective customers and the benefits would last into a second year<br>\u2711 A series of television and press advertisements was too expensive<br>\u2711 A direct mail shot to all customers - benefit would be short term<br>\u2711 Creation of an internet website - would not suit all customers<br>The calendar is seen as the favored option, as long as the company's competitors do not increase their marketing activity. Whilst the Marketing department wants a very high quality, glossy product, the project management team must be aware of the cost this will incur.<br>Which 2 statements should be recorded under the Timescale heading?<br>",
