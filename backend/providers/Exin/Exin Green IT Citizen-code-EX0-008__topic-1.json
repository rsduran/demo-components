        "content": "The technique you're describing is known as \"Triangulation.\"\n\nIn the context of estimating story points in Scrum, triangulation involves comparing a new user story with other user stories that the team has previously estimated. If the new story seems larger than a story that was estimated as 5 points but smaller than a story that was estimated as 13 points, the team might assign it a value that falls between these two, such as 8 points.\n\nTriangulation can help teams make more accurate estimations because it forces them to consider their past experience and how the new story compares to work they've done before."
