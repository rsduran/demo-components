Standards help in establishing common terminology, processes, and methodologies that can be widely adopted across different organizations and industries, facilitating the implementation of best practices.\n\nB. Technology can support best practices, but it is not considered an enabler by itself.\nC. Academic research contributes to the development of best practices but is not an enabler in the direct implementation sense.\nD. Internal experience is valuable for developing best practices but does not provide the external consistency and guidelines that standards do."
