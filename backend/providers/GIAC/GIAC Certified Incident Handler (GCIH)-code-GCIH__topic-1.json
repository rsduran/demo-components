    "body": "Adam, a novice computer user, works primarily from home as a medical professional. He just bought a brand new Dual Core Pentium computer with over 3 GB of<br>RAM. After about two months of working on his new computer, he notices that it is not running nearly as fast as it used to. Adam uses antivirus software, anti- spyware software, and keeps the computer up-to-date with Microsoft patches. After another month of working on the computer, Adam finds that his computer is even more noticeably slow. He also notices a window or two pop-up on his screen, but they quickly disappear. He has seen these windows show up, even when he has not been on the Internet. Adam notices that his computer only has about 10 GB of free space available. Since his hard drive is a 200 GB hard drive, Adam thinks this is very odd.<br>Which of the following is the mostly likely the cause of the problem?<br>",

Misconfiguration (e.g. open mail relay, missing patches, etc.)\n\nNessus is a powerful vulnerability scanning tool that can be used to detect and assess a wide range of vulnerabilities in a network. It can identify misconfigurations, such as open mail relay and missing patches, and recommend remediation steps to fix these issues.\n\nWhile Nessus can detect and assess other types of vulnerabilities, such as those that allow a remote attacker to control or access sensitive data on a system, it does not fix these vulnerabilities. Instead, Nessus provides information to help network administrators identify and prioritize the vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.\n\nCode injection attacks are a type of security vulnerability that allow attackers to inject malicious code into a system or application, and Nessus can detect and assess these vulnerabilities. However, Nessus does not fix these vulnerabilities and instead provides information to help administrators remediate them.\n\nTherefore, the vulnerability that can be fixed using Nessus is misconfiguration (e.g. open mail relay, missing patches, etc.)."

Operating as a shell script, it leverages common Unix/Linux tools such as the strings and grep command. The primary purpose is to scan core system programs for identifying signatures and to compare data obtained from traversal the /proc with the output derived from the ps (process status) command, aiming to identify inconsistencies.\n\nThis is exactly what the question is asking, I am going for C"

    "answerDescription": "Poisoning the cache -<br>With a good understanding of a properly-functioning DNS, it's time to see where things break. Cache poisoning is where the bad guy manages to inject bogus data into a recursive nameserver's cache, causing it to give out that bad information to unsuspecting local clients.<br>It's not so simple as just sending random DNS packets to a nameserver, as DNS only accepts responses to pending queries; unexpected responses are simply ignored.<br>How does a nameserver know that any response packet is \"expected\"?<br>\u2711 The response arrives on the same UDP port we sent it from: otherwise the network stack would not deliver it to the waiting nameserver process (it's dropped instead).<br>\u2711 The Question section (which is duplicated in the reply) matches the Question in the pending query.<br>\u2711 The Query ID matches the pending query<br>\u2711 The Authority and Additional sections represent names that are within the same domain as the question: this is known as \"bailiwick checking\".<br>This prevents ns.unixwiz.net from replying with not only the IP address ofwww.unixwiz.net , but also fraudulent information about (say) BankOfSteve.com.<br>If all of these conditions are satisfied, a nameserver will accept a packet as a genuine response to a query, and use the results found inside. This includes caching answers, as well as valid authority and additional data found there too.<br>But if the bad guy can predict and forge a DNS response packet that's just right, he can cause all kinds of shenanigans for the victims.<br>The bad guy normally first chooses his victim by finding a nameserver he believes vulnerable to poisoning: all of the clients of that DNS server get to unwittingly ride the victim train as well.<br>Then he finds a target domain, one he wishes to take over. His intent is to fool the victims into visiting his own malicious website instead of the real deal: by getting www.goodsite.com to resolve to the bad guy's IP address, the user's traffic visits the bad guy's website instead of the good one.<br>We noted that unexpected packets were simply dropped, so a bad guy need not get everything right every time: sending many packets attempting to guess some of the key parameters is likely to prove fruitful with enough attempts.<br><br>Guessing the Query ID -<br>In old nameservers (and in our detailed packet trace example), the Query ID simply increments by one on each outgoing request, and this makes it easy to guess what the next one will be as long as an interloper can see a single query.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03939/0015400001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>We probably can't directly ask the nameserver for its query ID, but we can provoke it into telling us:<br>1. Bad guy asks the victim nameserver to look up a name in a zone for a nameserver he controls (perhaps test.badguy.com).<br>He might query the server directly, if it permits recursion from his location, or he might convince      a user to lookup a name \u05d2\u20ac\" perhaps by including the test hostname on a web page.<br>2. Victim nameserver receives the request and makes the usual rounds to resolve the name starting at the root servers. Here, we've put the root and GTLD servers in the same category to separate them from the bad guy's nameserver.<br>3. Eventually, the victim nameserver will be directed to the bad guy's nameserver: after all, it's authoritative for badguy.com.<br>4. Bad guy monitors this lookup of test.badguy.com by sniffing the IP traffic going to his own machine, or perhaps even with a custom modification to the nameserver software, and from this discovers the source port and Query ID used.<br>At this point he knows the last query ID and source port used by the victim nameserver.<br>But the thoughtful might wonder: so what? This hasn't poisoned anything yet, and there's no need to engage in DNS shenanigans for badguy.com anyway. After all, the bad guy is already authoritative for his own zone.<br>Reference:<br>http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html",

It is limited to a maximum of 14 characters and is not suitable for cracking an 18-character password.\n\nSHA256 (B): SHA256 is a cryptographic hash function used for more secure password storage. However, Windows typically uses NTLM (NT) for password hashing, not SHA256.\n\nNT (C): NTLM (NT) is the password hash format used by Windows for user authentication. It is commonly used for password cracking in John the Ripper and similar tools.\n\nMS-CACHE (D): MS-CACHE is associated with cached credentials and not directly used for password cracking. The format used for password cracking is typically NTLM.\n\nIn John the Ripper, you would use a command like the following to specify the \"NT\" format:\n\nbash\n\njohn --format=NT hashfile"

It then uses nc (netcat) to listen on port 24680 and pipes the input to another instance of nc listening on port 54321 at IP address 10.2.200.1. The output of this second nc command is redirected to the named pipe (backpipe).\n\nThis technique allows you to relay data between two network connections. The idea is that one nc command listens on one port, and another nc command connects to that port and relays the data to another system.\n\nThis method is less likely to be detected by system administrators because it doesn't involve modifying system configuration files directly. It's a relatively stealthy way to establish a network relay without leaving obvious traces in system logs or configuration files."
