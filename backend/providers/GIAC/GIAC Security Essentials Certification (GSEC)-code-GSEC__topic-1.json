Encryption\n\nEncryption is the most critical layer of defense if an intruder is able to bypass all physical security controls and obtain tapes containing critical data. Encryption scrambles the data so that it is unreadable to anyone who does not have the encryption key. Even if an intruder is able to obtain the tapes, they will not be able to access the data without the key.\n\nThe other options are not as effective in protecting data from unauthorized access:\n\nCamera recordings can be helpful in identifying and prosecuting intruders, but they cannot prevent them from accessing data.\nSecurity guards can provide physical security, but they cannot prevent intruders from accessing data if they are able to bypass the physical security controls.\nShredding is an effective way to destroy data, but it is not possible to shred tapes after they have been stolen.\nCorrective controls are actions taken to respond to and recover from a security incident. They are important, but they do not prevent the incident from happening in the first place."

Business Impact Analysis\n\nA business impact analysis (BIA) is a process that identifies and assesses the potential impacts of a disruption to a business's critical operations. It is used to develop a business continuity plan (BCP), which is a plan for how the business will recover from a disruption.\n\nA BIA should quantify the effects of a potential disaster over a period of time, including the financial and non-financial impacts. This information can be used to prioritize the business's recovery efforts and to make informed decisions about investing in disaster prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nRisk assessment and disaster recovery planning are also important parts of business continuity management, but they do not quantify the effects of a potential disaster over a period of time. Lessons learned are the insights that are gained from past disruptions, and they can be used to improve the business's preparedness for future disruptions."

By default, all computers running Windows 2008 can be either workgroup members or domain controllers.\nB. Workgroups are typically lower in cost than domains, as domains require the purchase and maintenance of a domain controller.\nC. This is not true. You can have standalone computers in the midst of other machines that are members of a domain.\nD. Workgroup computers can share resources with each other, but they cannot access resources on a domain without being granted permission by the domain administrator."
