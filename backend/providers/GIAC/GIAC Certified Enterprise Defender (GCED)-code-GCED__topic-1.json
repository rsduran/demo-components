    "answerDescription": "When using tcpdump, a n switch will tell the tool to not resolve hostnames; as this network makes no use of DNS this is efficient. The vv switch increases the tools output verbosity. The \u2013s0 increases the snaplength to \"all\" rather than the default of 96 bytes. The \u2013nnvvX would make sense here except that the port in the filter is 6514 which is the default port for encrypted Syslog transmissions.",
