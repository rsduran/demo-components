The project customer has signed off on the project deliverable and Lamont has a few administrative closure activities to complete. In the project, there were several large risks that could have wrecked the project but Lamont and his project team found some creative methods to resolve the risks without affecting the project costs or project end date. What should Lamont do with the risk responses he identified during the project's monitoring and controlling process?<br>",

A risk register is a document that contains the results of qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis, and risk response planning. Description, category, cause, probability of occurring, impact on objectives, proposed responses, owner, and the current status of all identified risks are put in the risk register.<br>Answer option A is incorrect. A project charter is a document that officially recognizes and acknowledges that a project exists. It helps define requirements and expectations to all involved in the project. It is issued by the project sponsor. It can be as simple as a one-page form for a very small project, briefly describing the project and listing the responsibilities and authority of the project manager. Charters can be much longer, however, depending on the size of the project. In addition to formally authorizing a project, the charter provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. Project charters are important to the success of a project.<br>It's a good idea to have a project manager assigned to the project prior to the start of planning, and preferably while the project charter is being developed. Here's an example of a project charter.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02600/0001900001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><br>Answer option D is incorrect.

It assesses how they are involved in the project and identifies what role they play in the organization.

Activities are depicted as nodes on the network, and events that signify the beginning or ending of activities are depicted as arcs or lines between the nodes.<br>Answer option B is incorrect. The Critical Chain method is a project management technique in which schedule network analysis is used for the purpose of modifying and determining a set of project schedules to account for more inadequate than estimated project financial resources. This method tends to keep the resources levelly loaded, but requires the resources to be flexible in their start times and to quickly switch between tasks and task chains to keep the whole project on schedule. In the Critical Chain method, projects are completed more rapidly and with better scheduling consistency.<br>Answer option A is incorrect. Resource utilization simply means that the resource is scheduled for work.<br>Answer option C is incorrect. A resource leveling heuristic is a guideline, such as a maximum of 35 hours per week, per resource. It is a rule that usually signals the maximum amount of hours a resource may be utilized on the project.<br>Reference: \"Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide), Fourth edition\"<br>Chapter: Time and Cost Management<br>Objective: Critical Path Scheduling",
