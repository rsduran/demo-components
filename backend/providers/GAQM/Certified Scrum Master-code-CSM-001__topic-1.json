It focuses on the progress of work in terms of either the number of tasks or the work hours remaining to complete the Sprint Backlog items. The chart displays the relationship between the amount of work that needs to be completed and the time that has passed during the Sprint. It helps the Scrum Team and stakeholders visualize how the work is being completed over the course of the Sprint and whether the team is on track to meet the Sprint Goal."

Suppose one team has an understanding of what they mean when they say a particular Product Backlog item is Done, but another team has a different understanding. How will we ever have consistent quality and expectations?  \n\nIf Team A conducts performance testing for every Product Backlog item it delivers, but Team B does not, our entire product has lower quality, and each team is doing a different amount of work.  Having a shared Definition of Done among all teams avoids these problems.  Furthermore, if a Definition of Done has been created by the parent organization, then all product teams in that organization must adopt it as a minimum."
