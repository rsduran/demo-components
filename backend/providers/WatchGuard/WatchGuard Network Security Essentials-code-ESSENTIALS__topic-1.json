In the Pattern text box, type *.mywatchguard.com. Click Add. This denies any email messages with a Rcpt To address that does not match the company domain.<br>3. Click OK to close the SMTP Proxy Action Configuration dialog box.<br>C: In this exercise we will reduce the maximum email size to 5 MB (5, 000 kilobytes).<br>1.

He must also configure the Firebox to deny<br>Apple iTunes MP4 files because of a recent vulnerability announced by Apple.<br>1. From the SMTP-Incoming Categories list, select Attachments &gt; Content Types.<br>2. In the Actions to take section, use the None Matched drop-down list to select Allow.<br>This allows all content types through Firebox to the SMTP server. After Successful Company is able to add in the specific content types they want to allow, they set this parameter to strip content type that does not match their list of allowed content types.<br>From the SMTP-Incoming Categories list, select Attachments &gt; Filenames.<br>4. The filename extension for Microsoft Access databases is \".mdb\". In the list of filenames, find and select .mdb. Click Remove. Click Yes to confirm.<br>3. If no rules match, the Action to take option is set to allow the attachment. In this example, MS Access files are now allowed through the Firebox.<br>5. In the Pattern text box, type *.mp4. Click Add.<br>This rule configures the Firebox to deny all files with the Apple iTunes \".mp4\" file extension bound for the SMTP server.<br>E: The Set the maximum email recipient checkbox is used to set the maximum number of email recipients to which a message can be sent in the adjacent text box that appears, type or select the number of recipients.<br>The XTM device counts and allows the specified number of addresses through, and then drops the other addresses.

Should be answer A.\n\nInternet Access Options for Mobile VPN Users\nFor Mobile VPN with IPSec and Mobile VPN with SSL, you have two options for Internet access for your Mobile VPN users:\n\nForce all client traffic through tunnel (default-route VPN)\n\nThe most secure option is to require that all remote user Internet traffic is routed through the VPN tunnel to the Firebox. Then, the traffic is sent back out to the Internet. With this configuration (known as default-route VPN), the Firebox is able to examine all traffic and provide increased security, although it uses more processing power and bandwidth.\n\nAllow direct access to the Internet (split tunnel VPN)\n\nAnother configuration option is to enable split tunneling. With this option, your users can browse the Internet, but Internet traffic is not sent through the VPN tunnel. Split tunneling improves network performance, but decreases security because the policies you create are not applied to the Internet traffic. If you use split tunneling, we recommend that each client computer have a software firewall."

Be aware that this option requires more processing power and bandwidth.\n\nIf you select Routed VPN traffic in the Mobile VPN with SSL configuration, and you do not force all client traffic through the tunnel (split-tunnel), you must configure the allowed resources for the SSL VPN users. If you select Specify allowed resources or Allow access to all Trusted, Optional and Custom networks, only traffic to those resources is sent through the VPN tunnel. All other traffic goes directly to the Internet and the network that the remote SSL VPN user is connected to. This option can affect your security because any traffic sent to the Internet or the remote client network is not encrypted or subject to the policies you configured on the Firebox."
