This approach allows Docker to cache the results of individual stages in the build process. If a particular stage hasn't changed (for example, the dependencies installation step), Docker can reuse the cached layer from a previous build instead of executing the instructions again. This can significantly reduce build times, especially for complex builds where certain steps (like installing dependencies) do not change often but take a considerable amount of time to complete."
