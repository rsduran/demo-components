Additionally, version control repositories typically have a history of all changes made to files, so even if sensitive information is deleted at a later point, it can still be retrieved from the repository history.

For instance, if the goal is to manage configuration or orchestration that seems beyond the scope of what should be tightly coupled to a single resource's lifecycle, tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or Terraform itself (through resource dependencies and proper module design) are recommended to handle such configurations. These tools can be used in conjunction with Terraform but managed through their mechanisms for orchestration or configuration management, rather than through Terraform provisioners."

This is useful for setting sensitive data that should not be stored in your configuration.\ne.g. terraform apply -var 'db_password=My$ecretP@ssw0rd'\n\nD. \"secure string\" is not a valid option for keeping secrets out of Terraform configuration files. The term \"secure string\" is not a recognized or standard feature in Terraform."

Since it needs the state in order to know which real-world infrastructure objects correspond to the resources in a configuration, everyone working with a given collection of infrastructure resources must be able to access the same state data.\n\nBy default, Terraform implicitly uses a backend called local to store state as a local file on disk. Every other backend stores state in a remote service of some kind, which allows multiple people to access it. Accessing state in a remote service generally requires some kind of access credentials, since state data contains extremely sensitive information.\n\nSome backends act like plain \"remote disks\" for state files; others support locking the state while operations are being performed, which helps prevent conflicts and inconsistencies."

These blocks are not directly used by provisioners, but they can be referenced by the connection block.\n\nThe ssh block is used to configure the SSH client that Terraform will use to connect to the remote resource.

This helps to visually distinguish between different levels of nesting and improves readability of the code.\n\nIn Terraform, a common use case for nested blocks is to define resources that depend on other resources. For example, you might have a resource that creates a network security group, and then another resource that creates a virtual machine that references the network security group. In this case, the virtual machine resource would be indented four spaces compared to the network security group resource.\n\nUsing four spaces for indentation is a widely accepted standard in the software development community, and it is recommended to use four spaces for indentation in Terraform code as well."

A request must be submitted for infrastructure changes: In a ticket-based system, users often need to raise a request or a ticket for any infrastructure changes. This process can introduce delays, especially when changes are needed urgently or frequently. It can slow down the provisioning process as it adds an additional layer of approval and manual intervention.\n\nC. As additional resources are required, more tickets are submitted: In a ticket-based system, when scaling is required, users may need to submit additional tickets for each resource or instance they need. This manual process can become a bottleneck as the number of tickets increases, making it less efficient for scaling rapidly or handling dynamic workloads."

It also includes unlimited users and applies, so organizations can onboard any team member to collaborate, provision, and manage their own resources.\n\nFor larger teams with additional collaboration and governance features, there are paid plans. The Standard tier is great for organizations starting to use Terraform where team management, scalability, security, and support are critical.

When you run terraform init, Terraform downloads and installs the modules specified in the configuration, including local modules, and caches them in the .terraform directory.\n\nB. This statement is correct. Local modules are sourced from a directory on disk. You can specify the path to the directory containing your local module in your Terraform configuration.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect. Local modules do not support versions in the same way remote modules hosted on version control systems (e.g., Git) do. Local modules are typically referenced by a relative or absolute path, and there is no versioning mechanism built into Terraform for local modules.\n\nD.

During the plan phase.\n\nSentinel is a policy-as-code framework integrated with Terraform Enterprise that allows organizations to define and enforce policies on infrastructure changes. Sentinel enforces policy logic during the plan phase of a Terraform Enterprise run, before any changes are applied to the infrastructure. During the plan phase, Terraform generates an execution plan that describes the changes that will be made to the infrastructure. Sentinel evaluates policy rules against this execution plan to determine whether the proposed changes comply with the defined policies. If any violations are detected, the plan is rejected, and the changes are not applied.\n\nSentinel does not enforce policy logic before the plan phase or after the apply phase. However, Sentinel policies can also be used to enforce compliance on policy requirements that are not directly related to infrastructure changes, such as resource tagging or naming conventions. In these cases, Sentinel policies may be evaluated at other points in the Terraform Enterprise workflow, such as during VCS (version control system) integration or during cost estimation."

Firstly, Terraform code is typically stored in version control, and it may be copied to multiple systems from which it's run, such as a developer's machine, a CI/CD pipeline, or a Terraform cloud workspace. Any of those systems may not have robust security mechanisms, and exposing secrets in code leaves them vulnerable to potential attacks. Secondly, the Terraform code is copied to the target resources to be applied locally, so any secrets in the code could be exposed if a target resource is compromised.

This script can be version controlled, reviewed, and executed consistently across environments, adhering to the principles of IaC.\n\nThe other options are manual methods that do not adhere to the principles of IaC.

This can be beneficial for a number of reasons, including:\n\nKeeping unencrypted sensitive information off disk\nEasily sharing reusable code modules\nWorking in a team\nEnabling version control and auditing\nHowever, remote state does not allow you to delegate output to other teams. This is because the state file contains the full state of your infrastructure, including all of the resources that have been created. If you want to delegate output to other teams, you will need to use a different mechanism, such as a configuration management tool or a messaging system."

Rebuild only the instances that were deleted\n\nWhen you run terraform apply after some instances have been accidentally deleted by a senior admin, Terraform will detect the differences between your desired configuration (defined in your Terraform files) and the actual state of your cloud infrastructure (as recorded in the Terraform state file). It will then take the necessary actions to reconcile the two.\n\nIn this case, Terraform will identify that the instances were deleted and no longer exist in the state file. It will then create new instances to match the desired configuration, effectively rebuilding only the instances that were deleted.

It allows you to specify the exact version of the module you want to use. This ensures that your configuration consistently uses the same version of the module until you explicitly decide to update it to a newer version.\n\nUsing the version argument is a good practice to ensure that your infrastructure remains stable and predictable, as it prevents unintentional changes caused by automatic module updates."

While it's common to have a one-to-one mapping between configurations and workspaces, it's not a strict requirement.\n\nIn practice, you can have multiple remote workspaces associated with a single Terraform configuration. Each workspace can have its own state, variables, and environment. This allows you to manage different instances or environments of your infrastructure using the same configuration. For example, you might have separate workspaces for development, staging, and production environments, all using the same Terraform configuration.\n\nTo summarize, while it's typical to have a one-to-one mapping between a Terraform configuration and a remote workspace, it's not a strict limitation, and you can use multiple workspaces with a single configuration if it suits your organizational or project needs."

Note that even when TF_LOG_PATH is set, TF_LOG must be set in order for any logging to be enabled.\n\nSo, TF_LOG_PATH sets the directory itself, but it will not output anything unless TF_LOG is set."
