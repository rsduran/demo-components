Some of the characteristics of the two modes are:<br>\u2711 Main mode<br>- Protects the identities of the peers during negotiations and is therefore more secure.<br>- Enables greater proposal flexibility than aggressive mode.<br>- Is more time consuming than aggressive mode because more messages are exchanged between peers. (Six messages are exchanged in main mode.)<br>\u2711 Aggressive mode<br>- Exposes identities of the peers to eavesdropping, making it less secure than main mode.<br>- Is faster than main mode because fewer messages are exchanged between peers.
