If attack objects are modified as part of an attack update, they are updated in the group; if they are deleted, they are removed from the group. No new attack objects are added to this group, however. Static groups are very useful if you want strict control over adding new attacks into attack groups during signature updates to ensure that you don\u2019t cause unexpected results with new attack objects. The only things you need to define for static groups are the members that are added to this group."

Reboot the primary device, then the secondary device.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAfter assigning the cluster ID and node ID to each device, it is a good practice to reboot the primary device first. This ensures that the primary device comes online with the specified cluster and node IDs.\n\nOnce the primary device is up and running, you can then reboot the secondary device. The secondary device will recognize the existing cluster and node IDs assigned to the primary device and join the cluster accordingly.\n\nSo, the correct sequence is to reboot the primary device first and then the secondary device to establish the chassis cluster in the desired configuration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the secondary device should be rebooted after the primary device.\n\nOptions B and D are not accurate because both devices need to be rebooted, and the order is important for proper clustering."
