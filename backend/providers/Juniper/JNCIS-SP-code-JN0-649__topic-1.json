When enabled, MVRP affects all interfaces.\n\nExplanation:\n\nMVRP, when enabled, operates on all interfaces of the network device. It dynamically manages VLANs by exchanging control messages between neighboring switches to automate the creation and management of VLANs.\nOption A is true but it's not the only correct statement. The forbidden mode in MVRP prevents a port from participating in the VLAN registration process.\nOption C is incorrect. Timers in MVRP are used for various purposes related to the protocol operation, but they are not directly related to link state changes propagation.\nOption D is incorrect. MVRP (Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol) is independent of spanning tree protocols like RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol) and VSTP (VLAN Spanning Tree Protocol). It focuses on VLAN management and does not directly interact with spanning tree protocols."

Put another way, if you have a 10-Mbps and a 1-Mbps next hop, on average nine flows will map to the high-speed next hop for every one that uses the low speed.\n\nUse of BGP bandwidth community is supported only with per-packet load balancing.\n\nThe configuration task has two parts:\n\nConfigure the external BGP (EBGP) peering sessions, enable multipath, and define an import policy to tag routes with a bandwidth community that reflects link speed.\n\nEnable per-packet (really per-flow) load balancing for optimal distribution of traffic.\nhttps://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/bgp/topics/topic-map/load-balancing-bgp-session.html"

Routing between areas is organized hierarchically, allowing a domain to be administratively divided into smaller areas. This organization is accomplished by configuring Level 1 and Level 2 intermediate systems. Level 1 systems route within an area; when the destination is outside an area, they route toward a Level 2 system. Level 2 intermediate systems route between areas and toward other ASs.

In the control plane, EVPN Type 5 routes are used to advertise IP prefixes for inter-subnet connectivity across data centers.

In ISIS, if the \"wide-metrics-only\" command is configured on a router, then Level 1 (L1) routes are not advertised to Level 2 (L2) routers by default.\n\nThe \"wide-metrics-only\" command is used to optimize the exchange of routing information between L1 and L2 areas.
