If your outbound physical interface is configured as ethernet, the frame size that will cross the wire is expected be 14 bytes more, 18 bytes if link is configured with 802.1q encapsulation. If the traffic source sends packet with 1476 bytes, GRE tunnel interface will add another 24 bytes as overhead before handing it down to the physical interface for transmission.

These contributing routes could be directly connected routes, static routes, or routes learned through dynamic routing protocols.\nB. Generated routes do show a next hop in the routing table, which is determined based on the contributing route that led to their generation.\n\nTherefore, options A and B are correct regarding generated routes."

This could inadvertently limit the number of DHCP clients that can be learned on an interface, thus preventing new entries from being added to the DHCP snooping database.\n\nStatic IP address: If the device connected to the interface is configured with a static IP address, it will not go through the DHCP process and therefore will not have an entry in the DHCP snooping database1.The DHCP snooping feature relies on monitoring DHCP messages to build its database1, so devices with static IP addresses that do not send DHCP messages will not have their information added."
