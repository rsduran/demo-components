Queues with strict-high and high priority take turns transmitting packets until the strict-high queue is empty, the high priority queues are empty, or the high priority queues run out of bandwidth credit. Only when these conditions are met can lower priority queues send traffic.\nThe software locates all high-priority queues that are currently in profile. These queues are serviced first in a weighted round-robin fashion."
