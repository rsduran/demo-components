    "body": "Your customer is deploying a new data center in a collocation facility and will occupy several racks throughout the environment. The racks are not in close proximity and, in some cases, reside on different floors. The interconnected racks will never exceed a distance of more than 300 meters (925 feet) from each other. The connections within the customers environment are 10GbE and 40GbE. The customers requirements include high-performance operations, future proofing the connectivity design, and limiting the initial capital investment.<br>Which two recommendations would you provide the customer? (Choose two.)<br>",
