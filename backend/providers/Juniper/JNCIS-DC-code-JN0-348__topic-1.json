The LAG balances traffic across the member links within an aggregated Ethernet bundle and effectively increases the uplink bandwidth. Another advantage of link aggregation is increased availability, because the LAG is composed of multiple member links. If one member link fails, the LAG continues to carry traffic over the remaining links. https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/interfaces-ethernet-switches/topics/topic-map/switches-interface-aggregated.html"

However, sw-3 shortly will notice and tell sw-2 back that it is not the root bridge, instead sw-1 keeps beiing the root bridge and the path to reach the root bridge is via sw-3.
