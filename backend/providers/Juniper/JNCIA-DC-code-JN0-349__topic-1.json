Set the local-preference attribute for all routes received from ISP A to 200 while all routes received from ISP B use the default local-preference value of 100.\n\nExplanation: The local-preference attribute is used to influence the BGP route selection process within an autonomous system. A higher local-preference value is preferred, so by setting a higher value for routes received from ISP A, the BGP router will prefer those routes over the ones received from ISP B."

To allow the prefix to be advertised to the BGP peer, you need to check the BGP routing policy.\n\nAmong the options provided, enabling the advertisement of inactive BGP routes (Option B) is a potential solution. In Juniper routers, BGP by default does not advertise routes that are not considered \"active.\" If the route is learned from OSPF, it might be considered inactive in the BGP table. Enabling the advertisement of inactive BGP routes can help in advertising the prefix to the BGP peer.\n\nSo, the correct option would be:\n\nB. Enable the advertisement of inactive BGP routes."

DHCP snooping can be configured on LAN switches to exclude rogue DHCP servers and remove malicious or malformed DHCP traffic. In addition, information on hosts which have successfully completed a DHCP transaction is accrued in a database of bindings which may then be used by other security or accounting features.\n\nOther features may use DHCP snooping database information to ensure IP integrity on a Layer 2 switched domain. This information enables a network to:\n\nTrack the physical location of IP addresses when combined with AAA accounting or SNMP.\nEnsure that hosts only use the IP addresses assigned to them when combined with source-guard a.k.a. source-lockdown[2]\nSanitize ARP requests when combined with arp-inspection a.k.a. arp-protect"

Since this log demonstrates a misconfiguration, who's point of view will be preponderant? It is no quite clear why this should be an eBGP session because putting the same AS number on the remote BGP speaker would solve the problem. Besides, we are taking the point of view of the log  poducing router. The answer to demonstrate the session should be an eBGP one is the TCP connection is made with the source and IP addresses of only one subnet (these routers share a L2 link) and this complies with eBGP best practices for directly connected BGP speakers. iBGP speakers should source its TCP session from a loopback interface, thusly having diferent subnet sourced IP address for this endeavor."

In Juniper devices, you might configure a route filter with a prefix match type to filter out Martian addresses. Martian addresses are typically private or reserved addresses that should not appear on the public internet, and using a route filter with a prefix match type allows you to control their handling in the routing table.\n\nB. Martian addresses are not installed in the routing table by default on Juniper devices. Routers typically filter out Martian addresses to prevent them from being used in the global routing infrastructure. Juniper devices may have default filtering mechanisms in place to handle Martian addresses appropriately."
