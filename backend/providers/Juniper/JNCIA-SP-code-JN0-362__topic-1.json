If the resulting TTL in the inner IP\n   header is 0, the datagram is discarded and an ICMP Time Exceeded\n   message SHOULD be returned to the sender.

In fact it would make everything more complex. This simply would not be the main task of a 'virtual-router 'routing-instance'.\nAnswer B is incorrect since several 'routing-instance' types exist like: evpn, l2vpn, mpls-forwarding, virtual-switch, vpls, others...\nAnswer C is incorrect since, there exist different main mechanisms to deal with L3 VPN implementations."
