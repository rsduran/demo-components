When configuring a secondary interface, consider the following:\n\nFor OSPFv2, you cannot configure point-to-multipoint and nonbroadcast multiaccess (NBMA) network interfaces as a secondary interface because secondary interfaces are treated as a point-to-point unnumbered link.\nSecondary interfaces are supported for LAN interfaces (the primary interface can be a LAN interface, but any secondary interfaces are treated as point-to-point unnumbered links over the LAN). In this scenario, you must ensure that there are only two routing devices on the LAN or that there are only two routing devices on the LAN that have secondary interfaces configured for a specific OSPF area.\n\nhttps://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/ospf/topics/topic-map/configuring-ospf-areas.html#id-example-configuring-multiarea-adjacency-for-ospf"

BGP flap damping is a method of reducing the number of update messages sent between BGP peers, thereby reducing the load on these peers, without adversely affecting the route convergence time for stable routes.\n\nFlap damping reduces the number of update messages by marking routes as ineligible for selection as the active or preferable route. Marking routes in this way leads to some delay, or suppression, in the propagation of route information, but the result is increased network stability. You typically apply flap damping to external BGP (EBGP) routes (routes in different ASs). You can also apply flap damping within a confederation, between confederation member ASs. Because routing consistency within an AS is important, do not apply flap damping to internal BGP (IBGP) routes. (If you do, it is ignored.)"
