This certificate is typically signed by the device performing the SSL proxy function. The client sees this certificate instead of the actual server's certificate. The server certificate used in the proxy must be trusted by the client, either directly or through a chain of trust, which involves a Root Certificate Authority (CA).A root certificate authority (CA) is used by the SSL proxy to sign the server certificate that it presents to the client. The Root CA must be trusted by the client for the client to establish a trusted SSL session. In many cases, the Root CA used by the SSL proxy is an internal CA whose root certificate has been distributed to and trusted by client devices within the organization."
