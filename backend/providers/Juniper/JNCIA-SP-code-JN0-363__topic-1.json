Basically you have three protocols to build your MPLS network IGP, LDP, BGP.\nNow segment routing allows us to simply this by getting rid of the unnecessary protocols like LDP, RSVP etc. and use our IGPs (OSPF, IS-IS) to distribute labels bindings. This is to reduce loads on the control plane.\nI'm 100% sure the CORRECT ANSWER IS: CD"

This node SID is attached to an IPv4 and IPv6 router ID if the router ID is configured on the loopback interface. Otherwise, the lowest IP address assigned to the loopback interface is chosen as the node SID. Configuring a node SID through policy allows you to choose the loopback address that gets the node SID.

This node SID is attached to an IPv4 and IPv6 router ID if the router ID is configured on the loopback interface. Otherwise, the lowest IP address assigned to the loopback interface is chosen as the node SID. Configuring a node SID through policy allows you to choose the loopback address that gets the node SID. If the node SID configuration exists and a policy is defined for node SID selection for the same prefix, then the policy configuration takes precedence."

However, in some configurations, VRRP can operate in an active/active mode where multiple routers handle traffic simultaneously for load sharing.

This means the router communicates in the backbone and area 1, thus it is an ABR.\n\nDefault hello timer and dead intervals are configured\nhello-interval\u2014Specifies the length of time, in seconds, before the routing device sends a hello packet out of an interface. By default, the routing device sends hello packets every 10 seconds. The range is from 1 through 255 seconds.\ndead-interval\u2014Specifies the length of time, in seconds, that the routing device waits before declaring that a neighboring routing device is unavailable. This is an interval during which the routing device receives no hello packets from the neighbor. By default, the routing device waits 40 seconds (four times the hello interval). The range is 1 through 65,535 seconds.\n\nhttps://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/ospf/topics/topic-map/configuring-ospf-timers.html#:~:text=The%20hello%20interval%20and%20the,devices%20on%20a%20shared%20network."
