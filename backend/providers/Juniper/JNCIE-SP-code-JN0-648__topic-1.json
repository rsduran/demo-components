        "content": "BA classifiers are based on fixed-length fields in the packet header, which makes them computationally more efficient than MF classifiers. Therefore core devices that handle high traffic volumes are normally configured to perform BA classification. The BA classifier maps packets to a forwarding class and a loss priority. The forwarding class determines the output queue for a packet. The loss priority is used by a scheduler to control packet discard during periods of congestion.\n\nMF classification is normally performed at the network edge because of the general lack of support for DSCP or IP precedence classifiers in end-user applications. On an edge switch, an MF classifier provides the filtering functionality that scans through a variety of packet fields to determine the forwarding class for a packet. Typically, any classifier performs matching operations on the selected fields against a configured value.\n\nhttps://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/cos-ex/topics/concept/cos-ex-series-classifiers-understanding.html"
