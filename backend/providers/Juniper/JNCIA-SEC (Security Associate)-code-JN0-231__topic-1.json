Actions typically include allow, deny, or log.\nOther options:\n\nSource port and destination port: While these can be part of a policy, they are not required criteria for a zone-based security policy.

UTM solutions often inspect SMTP traffic to identify and block spam, malware attachments, and phishing emails.\n\nFTP (File Transfer Protocol):\nUTM devices may inspect FTP traffic to ensure that file transfers do not involve malicious content. This helps in preventing the spread of malware through file-sharing activities."

Static NAT, also known as one-to-one NAT, allows you to create a direct, fixed mapping between an internal private IP address and a specific public IP address. This ensures that incoming traffic destined for the public IP address gets translated to the corresponding internal private IP address.\n\nSo, for your scenario, configuring static NAT would be the appropriate choice."

In this method, the administrator handles change of password or resetting of forgotten password. Here, it requires that an user must remember a new password. This option is not much preferred from a security standpoint.\n\u2022 External Authentication\u2014In external authentication, you can allow the users to use the same user credentials they use when accessing other resources on the network. In many cases, user credentials are domain logon used for Active Directory or any other LDAP authorization system. This method simplifies user experience and improves the organization\u2019s security posture; because you can maintain the authorization system with the regular security policy used by your organization.\""

Address book entries usually use CIDR notation, not a combination of an IP address and a traditional subnet mask.\n\nB. 153.146.0.145/255.255.0.255: This option is invalid because the part after the slash is supposed to be a subnet mask in CIDR notation (which is a number between 0 and 32 for IPv4), but \"255.255.0.255\" is not a valid subnet mask in any format.\n\nC. 203.150.108.10/24: This is a valid address book entry. It uses CIDR notation, where \"/24\" indicates the subnet mask (255.255.255.0 in traditional format), and \"203.150.108.10\" is the IP address.\n\nD. 191.168.203.0/24: This is also a valid address book entry. Here, \"/24\" is the CIDR notation for the subnet mask, and \"191.168.203.0\" is the network address."
