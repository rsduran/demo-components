Working with Sky ATP, it protects perimeter-oriented threats as well as threats within the network. For example, if a user downloads a file from the Internet and that file passes through an SRX Series firewall, the file can be sent to the Sky ATP cloud for malware inspection. If the file is determined to be malware, Policy Enforcer identifies the IP address and MAC address of the host that downloaded the file. Based on a user-defined policy, that host can be put into a quarantine VLAN or blocked from accessing the Internet."
