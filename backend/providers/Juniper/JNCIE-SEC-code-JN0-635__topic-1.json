Private mode - This mode is used when you want Sky ATP to analyze only traffic from your specific organization, ensuring that all data and analysis remains private and isolated from other users. It's commonly selected to maintain strict data privacy and integrity.C. Tap mode - In this mode, Sky ATP passively monitors the traffic flowing through a mirrored or spanned port. It analyzes traffic copies without actively being in-line, which means it doesn't block or modify the traffic directly. This is useful for threat detection without impacting network performance."
