Without proper loop prevention protocols like STP, loops can cause broadcast storms and network instability.\n\nB) Additionally, switches inherently flood broadcast traffic to all ports within the broadcast domain, except the port on which the broadcast was received. This is because broadcast frams are meant to be delivered to all devices within the VLAN, and the switch ensures this by flooding these frames to all ports in the VLAN, except the source port."

This action is taken because the router cannot determine a valid path to forward the traffic. Unlike some scenarios where the router might generate an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) unreachable message, in many configurations, especially in production networks, the traffic might be silently discarded without providing feedback to the sender, as generating ICMP messages for all undeliverable packets could lead to additional network congestion and potential security concerns."

In the exhibit, the OSPF configuration has three export policies listed: policy1, policy2, and policy3. The static route 10.10.10.0/24 does not match any terms in policy1; therefore, it is not rejected by policy1 but is instead passed on to the next policy in the sequence, which is policy2.\n\nIf the static route matches a term in policy2 that permits the route, it will be exported into OSPF. If it does not match in policy2, it will then be evaluated by policy3. If there is no match in policy3 as well, and assuming there are no more policies listed, the route would then be subject to the default routing policy behavior, which typically rejects the route unless an explicit accept statement is present in the policies."

The candidate configuration is locked: When multiple users issue the \"configure exclusive\" command, it locks the candidate configuration, preventing other users from making changes to it simultaneously. This ensures that configuration changes made by one user are not overwritten or interfered with by others.\n\nC. Other users cannot enter configuration mode: As the candidate configuration is locked, other users attempting to enter configuration mode will be denied access until the current configuration session is released by the user who initiated the exclusive configuration mode. This helps maintain configuration consistency and avoids conflicts between multiple users."
