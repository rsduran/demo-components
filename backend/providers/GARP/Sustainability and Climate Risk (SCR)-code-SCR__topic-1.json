Ranking methods include ranking by likelihood of occurrence, adaptability and complexity, or severity. One way of ranking by severity is to examine what outcomes the risks affect, where risks affecting the fundamentals of business\u2014profits, revenues, and asset values\u2014are ranked as more severe than risks that only affect more ancillary out-comes such as employee morale or land use. Another way of prioritizing risks is to filter by the risks that the company can actually control."
