Reduced the number of entries in the routing table\n\nIn inter-VLAN route interworking in one-arm routing mode, the routing between VLANs is performed by a single router interface (one-arm routing), and this can lead to a reduction in the number of entries in the routing table. The router interface is connected to a switch, and traffic between VLANs is routed through this interface.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not directly associated with the advantages of inter-VLAN route interworking in one-arm routing mode. The reduction in the number of entries in the routing table is a specific advantage of this routing mode, as the router can route traffic between VLANs without needing separate physical interfaces for each VLA"

A device, however, can send packets to multiple devices with the same anycast address.\nAnycast addresses have the following advantages:\n1. Provide service redundancy. For example, a user can obtain the same service (for example, a \nweb service) from multiple servers that use the same anycast address. These servers are all \nresponders of anycast packets. If no anycast address is used and one server fails, the user \nneeds to obtain the address of another server to establish communication again. If an anycast \nIPv6 Basics Page 16\naddress is used and one server fails, the user can automatically communicate with another \nserver that uses the same address, implementing service redundancy."

An alternate port is one that provides an alternative path to the root switch, different from the path that the root port takes. It's in a blocking state but can transition to forwarding quickly if the network topology changes and the primary path (via the root port) fails.\nBackup Port: This is another new role introduced in RSTP. A backup port provides a redundant (backup) path to a segment where another switch port already connects. This port is also in a blocking state, and will only become active if the designated port for that segment fails."
