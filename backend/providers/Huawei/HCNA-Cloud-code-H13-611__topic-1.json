Converged storage system has better data protection compared to other non-converged systems.\n\nConverged storage systems do not have any inherent advantage over non-converged systems in terms of data protection. Both types of systems can be configured with the same level of data protection features, such as RAID, snapshots, and replication.\n\nThe other options are all benefits of converged storage systems.\n\nOption A: The same device is able to provide both block storage and file storage. This is a major benefit of converged storage systems, as it eliminates the need to have separate devices for each type of storage.\nOption B: Saving of rack space due to integration of equipment into one device. This is another benefit of converged storage systems, as it can help to reduce the amount of space required in the data center.\nOption D: Unified management of storage resources. This is a major benefit of converged storage systems, as it makes it easier to manage the storage resources in the data center.\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C."

IP SAN uses Ethernet networks to transport data, and it does not require any underlying optical networks.\n\nOptical networks are typically used for Fibre Channel SANs, which is a different type of SAN. Fibre Channel SANs use Fibre Channel to transport data, and they offer higher performance and reliability than IP SANs.\n\nHowever, there are some IP SANs that do use optical networks. These SANs are called Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP) SANs. FCIP SANs use IP to encapsulate Fibre Channel traffic, which allows them to be deployed over Ethernet networks.\n\nOverall, IP SANs do not use underlying optical networks to connect servers and storage systems. However, there are some IP SANs that do use optical networks, such as FCIP SANs."

Statement 1 is true; Statement 2 is false.\n\nStatement 1: Port zoning is preferred for zoning a FC switch when there are a lot of changes to the patch points.\n\nThis is true. Port zoning is a static zoning method where the ports on the Fibre Channel switch are assigned to zones. This is a good choice for environments where there are a lot of changes to the patch points, as it is easy to update the zoning configuration.\n\nStatement 2: Alias zoning is a user friendly version of soft zoning.\n\nThis is false. Alias zoning is a type of soft zoning. Soft zoning is a dynamic zoning method where the zones are created based on the WWNs of the devices. This is a more flexible zoning method than port zoning, but it can be more complex to manage.\n\nAlias zoning is a way to make soft zoning more user-friendly by creating aliases for the WWNs. This makes it easier to create and manage zones. However, alias zoning is still a type of soft zoning, not a user-friendly version of it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B. Statement 1 is true; Statement 2 is false."
