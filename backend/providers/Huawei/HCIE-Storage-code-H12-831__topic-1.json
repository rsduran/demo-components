MP-BGP includes additional message types and introduces the concept of VPNv4 (Virtual Private Network version 4) address families specifically designed to handle VPN routing information, which differs from traditional BGP-4 routing policies. These extensions enable BGP to carry various types of routing information, such as VPN-related routes in MPLS-based VPNs."
