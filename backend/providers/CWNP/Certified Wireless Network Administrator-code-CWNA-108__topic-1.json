At the end of the timer, STA process the answer it has received. If no answers received, STA moves to next channel &amp; repeats the discovery process. \nSTA sending Probe Request may specify the SSID they looking (called directed probe request). Then only IBSS STA or AP support that SSID will answer. The SSID value can also be set to 0 (ie SSID field is present, but empty). This is called Wildcard SSID or Null Probe Request.\nNull probe request: A probe request without the SSID information. A client station that is looking for any SSID sends a probe request with the SSID field set to null. If a null probe request is sent, all APs that hear the request should reply by sending a probe response."

It is also known as Wi-Fi 6E.\n\nIEEE 802.11ax was released in 2021 and is the latest Wi-Fi standard. It offers a number of improvements over previous standards, including:\n\nIncreased speed and capacity\nImproved performance in congested environments\nReduced latency\nSupport for new features such as MU-MIMO and OFDMA\nIEEE 802.11ax devices can operate in all three frequency bands, but the 6 GHz band is the most exciting new feature. The 6 GHz band offers more channels and less congestion than the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, which can lead to significant performance improvements.\n\nTo take advantage of the 6 GHz band, you will need a Wi-Fi 6E router and Wi-Fi 6E client devices. Wi-Fi 6E devices are still relatively new, but they are becoming more and more common."
