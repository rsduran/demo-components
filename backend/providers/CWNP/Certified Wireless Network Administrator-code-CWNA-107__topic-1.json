So when one of them is transmitting frames, the other(s) won't know that they need to wait for it to finish before transmitting on the medium. If/when any other node transmits frames on the wireless medium, it thus leads to a collision, making it needful for retransmission to take place. Thus a hidden node problem in a network will result in a higher frequency of retransmissions among those nodes."
