When the controller receives the incoming transmissions of a client, the SCA controller evaluates the RSSI values of the client\u2019s transmissions. Based on incoming RSSI measurements, the SCA controller can allocate a specific AP for downlink transmissions. The client believes that it is associated to a single AP. However, the client moves between different physical APs based on RSSI measurements evaluated by the controller."
