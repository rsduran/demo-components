Components of the data-link layer include frame-format, Media Access Control (MAC) addressing, protocol identification and error detection.<br>When data is being sent, it is split into protocol data units (PDUs) as it passes through the layers of the OSI model. The PDUs have different names as they are passed through the layers of the OSI model. In layer 2, the PDU is called a Frame.<br>The most common protocol specified in the data-link layer is Ethernet and the most common network component in the data-link layer is a network switch.<br>In this question, problems are discovered with Ethernet frames by examining the logs in a network switch. Therefore, for this question, we are working in Layer 2, the data-link layer.",

The network devices sense when the line is idle and therefore available for the transmission of data. The network device then transmits a data frame onto the network. If another device sends a frame at exactly the same time, a collision occurs and the frames are discarded. The network devices will then wait for a random period of time before attempting to send the frame again.",

    "answerDescription": "Fire suppression systems are often deployed in server rooms to prevent a fire destroying all the I.T. equipment. Different fire suppression systems work in different ways. Obviously a fire suppression system that sprays water onto the fire is no good for a server room as the water would do as much damage as the fire. A common fire suppression system used in server rooms is one that suppresses the fire by starving it of oxygen. One way the oxygen can be removed from the server room is to fill the server room with an inert gas such as carbon dioxide.",
