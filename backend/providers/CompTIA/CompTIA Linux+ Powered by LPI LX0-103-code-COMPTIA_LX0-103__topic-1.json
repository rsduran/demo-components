The following commands are used to reboot the system when using SysV init:\n\nA. shutdown -r now - The shutdown command is used to bring the system down, either for maintenance or for a reboot. The -r option indicates that the system should be rebooted, and the now argument specifies that the reboot should occur immediately.\n\nC. telinit 6 - The telinit command is used to change the runlevel of the system. The runlevel 6 is used to reboot the system, so the command telinit 6 will cause the system to reboot."

SysV init\n\nAn init system is the first process that is started by the Linux kernel when the system boots, and it is responsible for starting and managing other system processes. There are several init systems used within Linux systems, including:\n\nB. systemd - systemd is a modern init system that is widely used in many Linux distributions, including Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Ubuntu. It is designed to be fast, flexible, and scalable, and it provides many advanced features, such as parallel startup of system services and dynamic management of system resources.\n\nC. Upstart - Upstart is an event-based init system that was developed for the Ubuntu operating system. It provides a powerful and flexible way to manage system services, and it supports parallel startup of system services, which can result in faster boot times.\n\nE. SysV init - SysV init is a traditional init system that is widely used in many Linux distributions. It is a simple and straightforward init system that has been in use for many years and is well-understood and widely supported."
