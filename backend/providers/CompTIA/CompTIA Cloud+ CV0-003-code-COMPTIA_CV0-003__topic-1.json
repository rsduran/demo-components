    "body": "A company has decided to scale its e-commerce application from its corporate datacenter to a commercial cloud provider to meet an anticipated increase in demand during an upcoming holiday.<br>The majority of the application load takes place on the application server under normal conditions. For this reason, the company decides to deploy additional application servers into a commercial cloud provider using the on-premises orchestration engine that installs and configures common software and network configurations.<br>The remote computing environment is connected to the on-premises datacenter via a site-to-site IPSec tunnel. The external DNS provider has been configured to use weighted round-robin routing to load balance connections from the Internet.<br>During testing, the company discovers that only 20% of connections completed successfully.<br><br>Instructions -<br>Review the network architecture and supporting documents and fulfill these requirements:<br>Part 1:<br>\u2711 Analyze the configuration of the following components: DNS, Firewall 1, Firewall 2, Router 1, Router 2, VPN and Orchestrator Server.<br>\u2711 Identify the problematic device(s).<br>Part 2:<br>\u2711 Identify the correct options to provide adequate configuration for hybrid cloud architecture.<br>If any time you would like to bring back the initial state of the simulation, please click the Reset All button.<br><br>Part 1 -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0000300001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0000400001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0000500001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0000500002.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0000600001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0000700001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0000800001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0000800002.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><br>Part 2 -<br>Only select a maximum of TWO options from the multiple choice question.

As has been hinted at by others it seems that you need to select one defective device (yes, it's router 2) but then the network needs to be configured for a hybrid architecture. So it's either the DNS or add application server. One mans opinion. Good luck on the test."

Since the DR site has been operational for a week, setting up replication would allow the primary datacenter's block storage to quickly catch up with the changes made at the DR site. This approach ensures that the primary datacenter becomes up-to-date with minimal data loss and downtime.\n\nOption B (Copy the data across both sites) would likely be inefficient and time-consuming, especially if the amount of data is large, as it involves manually copying data across both sites, which may not capture changes made during the past week.\n\nOption C (Restore incremental backups) and option D (Restore full backups) are not as efficient in this scenario because they involve restoring data from backups, which may not capture all changes made at the DR site since the failure occurred. Additionally, restoring backups could result in longer downtime and potential data loss compared to replication, which provides near real-time data synchronization."

For more clarity:\n\nIf 5,000 concurrent sessions are needed, the 4 nodes are required. Each node requires 6 vCPUs at the 5,000 mark. So if you're math is 4 nodes x 6 vCPU per node, you will equal out to 24 vCPUs. By doing the same thing for RAM, each node requires 64GB of RAM at the 5,000 mark.

Licensing: While licensing considerations may be important, especially when migrating to another cloud provider, they are generally more manageable compared to the challenges of vendor lock-in. Licensing issues can often be addressed through negotiations with vendors or by selecting cloud providers with favorable licensing terms.\n\nB. Authentication providers: Authentication providers, such as identity and access management (IAM) services, are important for security and user management but are typically more adaptable to different cloud environments. While there may be some differences in authentication mechanisms between cloud providers, they are generally less restrictive than platform-specific components.\n\nC. Service-level agreement (SLA): Service-level agreements define the terms of service availability, performance, and support provided by a cloud provider. While SLAs are important for ensuring reliability and performance, they are generally negotiable and can be adjusted to meet the company's requirements when migrating to another cloud provider. However, vendor lock-in may limit the flexibility to negotiate favorable SLAs with alternative providers."

To subnet a network, you borrow bits from the host portion to create smaller subnets. The number of bits you borrow determines the number of subnets you can create and the size of each subnet.\n\nHere's how you can determine the number of subnets you can create:\n\nDetermine the Number of Subnet Bits: Subtract the original prefix length from the desired new prefix length. For example, if you want to subnet a /24 network into /26 subnets, you would subtract 24 from 26, resulting in 2 subnet bits.\n\nCalculate the Number of Subnets: Raise 2 to the power of the number of subnet bits. This gives you the number of subnets you can create. For example, if you have 2 subnet bits, you can create 2^2 = 4 subnets.\n\nthis means that from a /24 network you can create only 2 /25 subnets( 25-24 = 1,  2^1 = 2)\n4 subnets of /26 ( 26-24 = 2, 2^2 = 4) (theses ones still fail to make enough nodes per region however)\n8 subnets of /27 (27-24 = 3, 2^3= 8)"

API request limit.\n\nWhen using a SaaS-based service to send emails in an automated manner, such services often have API rate limits in place to prevent abuse or overuse of their infrastructure. These rate limits restrict the number of API requests (in this case, sending emails) that can be made within a certain timeframe. If the CRM system attempted to send 50,000 emails in a short period and hit the API request limit, it would result in only a portion of the emails being sent, which aligns with the described issue.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are less likely to be the cause of the problem. An incorrect billing account typically doesn't affect the number of emails that can be sent. Misconfigured auto-scaling and bandwidth limitations are more related to infrastructure scaling and network performance, which might not be the primary issue when dealing with email API requests."

The wrong gateway\n\nExplanation:\n\nGiven the subnet mask of 255.255.255.224, the subnet range for the VM's IP address (172.16.31.38) would be 172.16.31.32 to 172.16.31.63, with 172.16.31.33 as the first usable address and 172.16.31.62 as the broadcast address. The default gateway for this subnet should be within this range, but typically, it would be one of the first or last usable addresses in the range, like 172.16.31.33 or 172.16.31.62.\n\nThe provided gateway, 172.16.31.254, does not fall within the 172.16.31.32/27 subnet range, which is why the VM cannot access the Internet or other subnets.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the correct gateway should be set to an address within the VM's subnet range. For example, if the standard practice in the network is to use the first usable address as the gateway, the gateway should be set to 172.16.31.33. If the last usable address is used, it should be 172.16.31.62."

If the DR test was successful, you might have already performed the failover during the test. In a production environment, failover would have been triggered by a disaster.\n\n2. **Restore Backups**: This step may be necessary during the failback process or as part of the overall recovery plan. However, restoring backups is generally done after initiating the failback because you want to ensure that your primary environment is operational before restoring data to it."

During the DR test, network configurations may have been altered to route traffic to the DR site. Configuring the network correctly during the failback ensures that traffic is routed back to the primary site.\n\n4. **Perform a Failback**: A failback is the process of returning operations from the DR site (or backup environment) to the primary site once it is ready to resume normal operations. This step includes reversing any changes made during the failover or DR test and ensuring that the primary environment is fully operational.\n\nIn summary, initiating a failback is typically the FIRST action taken after a successful DR test to return operations to the primary site and resume normal business activities. The other actions may be necessary as part of the overall recovery plan but usually follow the failback process."

It means that when you create a VM, it's given a small initial allocation of storage, and additional storage space is allocated only as the VM consumes it. This approach optimizes storage utilization, as you avoid allocating a large amount of storage upfront that may go unused. It's an efficient way to make the most of your storage resources while still accommodating the VM's actual storage needs."

Move the digital certificate to the load balancer: Offloading SSL/TLS termination to the load balancer can significantly reduce CPU utilization on the VMs. The load balancer will handle the encryption/decryption process, freeing up CPU resources on the VMs.\n\nC. Configure the communication between the load balancer and the VMs to use HTTP: After moving the digital certificate to the load balancer, the traffic between the load balancer and the VMs can be sent over HTTP, which requires less CPU processing compared to HTTPS.

By reducing the MTU size, we aim to minimize the need for packet fragmentation, thus potentially reducing delays associated with retransmission of fragmented packets.\n\nAdditionally, adjusting the MTU size is a network-level configuration that doesn't directly impose additional computational overhead on the servers, unlike enabling compression. While decreasing the MTU size may lead to slightly more packets being sent, it generally doesn't require significant additional computational resources compared to compression.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the specific network environment and the underlying causes of network delay that the question simply does not give us."

They allow private network connectivity between regions or data centers, providing a low latency connection for data replication. They also ensure secure and reliable connectivity between the different regions, without the need for additional VPN or peering configurations.\n\nPeering is a method of connecting networks through a direct connection between the two networks.

A network vulnerability scan**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Agent-based scan (A)** typically involves installing an agent on the target system. In this case, since you're dealing with a DMZ web server in an IaaS compute instance, it may not be feasible to install an agent directly on the instance, especially if it's externally facing. Additionally, agent-based scans are more commonly used for endpoints and servers within your organization's network."

        "content": "- **Network vulnerability scan (B)** is the best choice for this scenario. Network vulnerability scanning tools, like Nessus or OpenVAS, can scan the target system over the network without requiring an agent. Given the provided firewall settings, the web server allows traffic on ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and ICMP echo requests. Network vulnerability scanners can assess the vulnerabilities of the web server based on these open ports and the services running behind them.\n\n- **Default and common credentialed scan (C)** usually involves using default or common credentials to check for vulnerabilities on the target system. This might not be suitable for an externally facing web server, as it could be a security risk to use credentials that are not specifically configured for this purpose."

Moreover, the provided firewall settings might not allow the necessary ports and protocols for credential-based scans.\n\nIn summary, a network vulnerability scan is the most accurate and appropriate choice for assessing the security of the web server in the DMZ with the given firewall settings."

With traditional virtualization, the hypervisor controlled access between VMs and the bus. This control added a layer of complexity and latency to the structure.\n\nThe PCIe bus has been extended to address this concern. The single root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV) functionality permits direct access between the VM and the PCIe bus and, by extension, the NICs on the bus. This permits much faster communication between the physical network connection and the VMs on the host server.\n\nThe SR-IOV is particularly attractive to private cloud administrators that may be trying to gain as much efficiency as possible with the hardware deployments in their private data centers."

All one can control (using O365/M365 as the example again) is your licensing and comparing the staff intake with the current licenses to see if the company will be able to cover any new staff members and for how long.\n\nA very rough example, but all that makes sense for me here is licensing."

Scalability directly impacts the ability to accommodate growth in users and usage patterns.\nEffective capacity planning focuses on ensuring that the infrastructure can handle increasing loads, adapt to fluctuating demands, and maintain performance. This means designing the system to scale efficiently\u2014whether that\u2019s adding more resources, optimizing performance, or managing load balancing.\nLicensing, on the other hand, is typically a separate concern that deals with the legal and financial aspects of software usage rather than the technical capacity to support user demand. Licensing considerations are also important for compliance and revenue management.\nFrom the above argument, it is more than evident that Scalability is relevant for Papacity Planning, and not Licensing."

Flash storage is known to have a much higher IOPS capacity than spinning disk storage, which should help to resolve the performance issue. Upgrading the virtual database server or checking if other machines on the same storage are having issues may not necessarily resolve the disk-related performance issue. Documenting the findings and placing them in a shared knowledge base is important, but it should not be the next step in resolving the issue."

Calling trees (Answer B) are used for communication during incidents but don't address the issue of overlapping responsibilities.

But, although anti-affinity rules enhance fault tolerance by distributing VMs across hosts, they may not address the immediate need for maintaining service availability in the event of a hypervisor failure, which can be addressed more effectively with features like live migration. \n\nThe option that would provide high availability to the application environment in case of hypervisor failure is C. Live migration.\nLive migration is a feature provided by virtualization platforms that allows a running virtual machine (VM) to be moved from one physical host (hypervisor) to another with minimal downtime or service interruption. This capability ensures that if one hypervisor fails, the VMs can be quickly migrated to another healthy hypervisor without impacting the availability of the application environment. Live migration is a key component of high availability solutions in virtualized environments."

Compute**\n\nIn a virtualized environment, compute resources such as CPU and memory are allocated to VMs. When you perform vertical scaling by adding more vCPUs to a VM, it requires that the underlying physical host has available CPU resources to allocate. If there are not enough available CPU resources on the host, you may encounter errors or limitations when trying to vertically scale the VMs."

Additionally, monitoring and performance analysis tools can help identify resource bottlenecks and guide resource allocation decisions."

The question is which is more important in the scope of this question and they don't make it real clear."

This allows you to quickly revert to a known good state while you investigate and address the issues with the green stack separately.\n\nRebooting servers, restoring from backups, or troubleshooting and resolving issues in the green stack may take longer and could potentially worsen the situation if the root cause of the issues is not immediately clear.

Disk I/O contention can cause delays in reading essential files and configurations required for VDI sessions. If the underlying storage infrastructure is not optimized or has I/O limits, this can be a contributing factor."

The number of CPUs in the server is the MOST important consideration when attempting to calculate licensing costs for software that applies fees on a socket-based model.\n\nIn a socket-based licensing model, licensing fees are typically determined by the number of CPU sockets or processor sockets in the server where the software is deployed. Each CPU socket represents a unit of licensing, and the more CPU sockets a server has, the more licenses are required. Memory, cloud type, and the number of customers may be factors in other licensing models, but in a socket-based model, it's primarily the number of CPU sockets that drives the licensing costs."

This ensures that the virtual machine remains on the same hardware, meeting the requirement that the hardware does not change.\n\nContainers are a lightweight form of virtualization but may not guarantee that the application runs on its own virtual machine, and they don't provide control over the physical host hardware. Firewalls and load balancers serve different purposes related to network security and traffic distribution and do not directly address the requirement of ensuring that the application runs on a dedicated virtual machine on specific hardware. Affinity rules are specifically designed for this kind of workload placement control in virtualized environments."

Deduplication rates for VDI deployments can range as high as 95% savings. Of course that number will vary depending on the amount of user data, etc and it will also change over the course of any one day.\n\nData Deduplication optimizes files as a post processing operation. That means, as data is added over the course of a day, it will not be optimized immediately and take up extra space on disk. Instead, the new data will be processed by a background deduplication job. As a result, the optimization ratio of a VDI deployment will fluctuate a bit over the course of a day, depending on home much new data is added. By the time next optimization is done, savings will be high again.\n\nSaving space is great on its own, but it has an interesting side effect. Volumes that were always too small, but had other advantages are suddenly viable."

Configuring infrastructure as code\n\nConfiguring infrastructure as code (IaC) is the best approach for automating the provisioning of resources at the infrastructure layer without modifying application code. With IaC, you define and manage your infrastructure using code, which can be versioned and automated. This allows you to consistently and efficiently provision and manage resources, ensuring that the infrastructure is aligned with your application's requirements. IaC tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation are commonly used for this purpose."

This will involve setting up the access controls, permissions, and policies to ensure that only authorized users or groups have the appropriate level of access, preventing unauthorized changes or deletions of files. Additionally, it's important to review and audit the changes made to permissions to ensure that they align with the organization's security policies and requirements."

It's not suitable for file integrity checks through hashing.\n\nTherefore, in terms of performance, MD5 would be the most appropriate choice among the options provided. However, it's important to note that MD5 is considered less secure than SHA-256 and SHA-512, so depending on the level of security required, SHA-256 might be preferred despite its higher computational overhead."

Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that come with increased production or service capacity. As CSPs expand their data centers and infrastructure to serve a global customer base, they can achieve economies of scale by spreading the costs of hardware, data centers, and maintenance across a large number of customers. This allows them to provide seemingly limitless capacity and resources to individual customers without the need for those customers to invest in their own physical infrastructure."

Incorrect configuration in the message queue length\n\nThe message queue length or capacity may not have been configured to handle such a high volume of incoming and outgoing transactions. This can result in queuing delays, slowing down the integration service for all companies.\n\nWhile the other options (A, C, and D) could potentially cause issues, they are less likely to be the root cause of slowness in the integration service, especially when a specific event like a significant increase in transaction volume has occurred."

NVMe is a high-performance storage interface that can provide significantly faster read and write speeds compared to traditional spinning disks and SSDs (Solid-State Drives). NVMe storage operates over the PCIe interface and allows for low latency and high throughput data access. NVMe storage is particularly well-suited for applications that require high IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second) and low latency.\n\nWhile SSDs also offer fast read/write times compared to spinning disks, NVMe can provide even faster speeds due to its optimized design.

It works by introducing a delay or slowing down the login process after a certain number of failed login attempts. This delay increases with each subsequent failed attempt, making it increasingly difficult for an attacker to conduct a brute force attack.\n\nImplementing a progressive login delay can help protect user accounts from unauthorized access without significantly impacting the user experience for legitimate users, especially when combined with other security measures like account lockout and account recovery options. It's an effective way to thwart automated password-guessing attacks while allowing legitimate users to log in without excessive hindrance."

Automated storage tiering\n\nAutomated storage tiering is a technique used to optimize storage performance by automatically moving data between different tiers of storage based on its access frequency and importance. In this scenario, since the company has limited SSD storage and a lot of spinning disks due to budget constraints, implementing automated storage tiering would allow frequently accessed and critical data to be stored on the faster SSD storage, while less frequently accessed data can be stored on the slower spinning disks. This would maximize speed for critical operations while efficiently utilizing the available resources."

Similarly, the latency from EMEA to EMEA regions is low (20 ms).\n\nTherefore, the connectivity from APAC to EMEA and Americas regions (option D) appears to be the area that needs further investigation, as it shows higher latency compared to the other connections within the same regions (APAC and EMEA). Investigating this connectivity further may help identify and address the delays observed during deployments."

Autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of compute resources (such as virtual machines or containers) based on predefined conditions or metrics, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, or incoming network traffic. When demand increases, autoscaling can dynamically add more resources to handle the load, and when demand decreases, it can remove unnecessary resources to optimize costs."
