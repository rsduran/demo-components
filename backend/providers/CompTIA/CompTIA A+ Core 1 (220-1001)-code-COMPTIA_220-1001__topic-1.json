Different BIOS actually use different POST code beep combinations, so you'll need to know the BIOS (Or manufacturer) as a RAM error code is sometimes used. On OSX, RAM issues can be signified by POST issues as well. Continuous Reboots can be from a variety of issues (Including a power supply slowly failing). If it occurs after using the computer for a bit, it is  not a RAM installation error (Although BSOD can sometimes have a memory error/leak cause a reboot). RAM being installed poorly usually means a computer will just fail to boot (Thus simulating continuously rebooting). Pay attention to little tells though. Do the fans spin up? Do lights turn on? It may look like RAM or the PSU only to be something really unexpected like the CPU overheating from poor thermal paste application and a failed fan only seconds into turning it on."

CompTIA by his own logic has just one answer and they want them from us. :)\n\nMy Answer suggestion is A - POST beep codes.\nReason: If you check out different CompTIA approved Books they refer for POST Beep codes everytime to RAM Troubleshooting. Different HW Manufactors (Dell as example) only have one POST Beep code available -&gt; RAM. All other Error Codes are LED based.\n\nCapacitors and wrong BIOS time for sure wrong.\n\nContinuous Reboots, could be possible, but normally RAM error at post will halt the system and during OS-Boot or running OS it will result in a BSOD or other Error. Again refering to different CompTIA Approved Books they highlighting Electrical issues, Power Supply, Overheating and Motherboard issues for  continuous reboots.\n\nHope that helps?! Any thoughts?\nRegards"

Also warranties often don't cover water damage so before diving in, find out how much liability is on your end if you fail to be able to fix an issue or an issue is larger than you realize. Always look for glaring issues such as burn marks on a part (wet parts can have electricty arc or heat across pieces, frying and destroying them). Water Damage is a risky commitment to fix, especially if the client is a bit too embarrassed to be honest or has tried to turn it on repeatedly. Verify if they ever booted it up only to have it crash and stop booting after. This is a good sign that water damage caused some internal physical harm that should be investigated."

It's totally acceptable to create a powerpoint, send an email, write a document, or whatever is neccesary to explain different systems and technology. As a rule, realize that if you don't train your staff. They won't learn it themselves. Often they'll continue poor habits or waste time and resources (Printing on one side, not doing collated). Simple things like this go a long way. The same goes for Office products, Windows 10, Email systems. Think through what a person needs to know on Day one to be sufficient and start communicating that. Overcommunicate. It'll save you tons of time solving problems that could have been avoided."

This information can be useful for future reference and in sharing insights with colleagues.\n\nB. Reboot the device to verify the fix: Rebooting the device after making changes or fixing an issue is a common step to ensure that the changes take effect. It helps confirm whether the problem is resolved and if the system functions properly after the applied fixes.\n\nWhile the other options (C, D, E, and F) might be relevant in certain troubleshooting scenarios, they are not the immediate next steps after removing malware and verifying basic connectivity."

An employee may have accessed something or exposed the system to something if he took the device on vacation, if he didn't, it's disconcerting that the error appeared after his absence. It's good to do a quick virus scan, browse the event log viewer, and just document this error. Look for patterns. If you are suspicious enough that the computer wasn't used correctly, checking the what the device has accessed is a possible step too as long as it is within the right and authority of the IT person. It's always good to verbally ask an employee if they've accessed a bad site or been to places prone to virus attacks BEFORE doing anything that may seem an invasive of privacy. This allows them to be honest and understand you are doing your job and due diligence to defend the company."

Without the battery, they couldn't do caching without risk of data loss during a power failure.  If your raid controllers battery (BBU) is dead, then write caching will be disabled.  \nOn a dell server running windows server 2012r2 with a PERC raid controller, an error pops up telling me that the battery has failed and that write caching has been disabled. I truly hope that this appears in the event log as well, but it is hard to say. That raid controller in my Dell server can be accessed using the \"Openmanage Server Administrator\" tool, which is a web server running at localhost:1311 (https) - but on another server of mine that has (I think) an LSI Megaraid controller, it doesnt let me manage it from within windows at all. I have to manage it all during a bootup of the server. - needless to say, I don't beleive that one shows me any errors in the windows event log. I have to observe the blinking lights, or hang around the office late at night to do a scheduled reboot to check on it.\n\nRegardless, the first thing you do is check the log.  Then you probably need to replace that damned battery...."

Good communication, testing with the phone (Outside connection), and calling the ISP are all ways to find out answers to what the source of throttling is. Throttling is very helpful in making sure a system has stability, especially if some users use immense amounts of bandwidth. When it comes to ISP throttling, it can be everything from annoying to downright illegal so keep GREAT documentation when experiences bad service."

They may have plastic clips or non-universal designs. Breaking some of these small pieces is often painful, hard to replace, and expensive. Caution is the best answer if you are unfamiliar with a laptop design. By all means, ALWAYS document, but be aware that foreign design elements can be broken when pulling off a piece of case. It's usually most common with circuit cables that are connected in a place you wouldn't expect."

In the real world, FN function can be a pain and on old systems can trigger issues. While it's a cheap easy fix, it doesn't catch all the problems. It also doesn't neccesitate that a reboot will keep the same FN settings. For instance a laptop may switch us FN only to have powerpoint be configured poorly and when doing the slideshow you get terrible resolution issues, poor pairing, or more. I'd agree with display settings just being the more wise solution and testing afterwards with whatever needs to be used. Since this is a permanent setup too, restarting once to make sure the setting sticks will save an extra trip back to fix things :)"

Often it could mean dead pixels, or old images that aren't changing quickly, or bad resolution, or just relative visual issues. If the visual artifacts are dead pixels, it may be piece of the projector needing to be replaced. Contrast should help with brightness and the aspect ratio will allow it to fit the screen correctly. Projectors are a normal job encounter though so make sure to document what projectors you have, how often bulbs need to be replaced, and what vendor you go through as they'll probably need maintanence once or twice a year in high-use settings."

A good first step in troubleshooting these kinds of issues is to clear the current jobs in the print queue and then try reprinting again. Since the printer is access via a print server, it is unlikely that restarting the user's workstation or updating the print drivers on their workstation will fix the printing issue. Also, a network printer usually uses a CAT 5e network cable, not a USB cable, for connection to the network.\n\nExplanation from Jason Dion's Udemy practice exams"

If you use the lowest ohms (resistance) setting, you can touch the multimeter's black lead to a grounded metal surface and touch the red lead to each wire of the circuit. If you get a meter reading of zero ohms (low resistance), then this indicates that the circuit is properly grounded. If you get a meter reading of infinity, O.L., Open Loop, or a needle that pegs high on the meter, this indicates an open circuit with no path to ground.\n\nFrom Jason Dion's Udemy practice exams"

Movement could disrupt airflow or cause components such as fans or heat sinks to become dislodged, leading to overheating and subsequent shutdowns. Therefore, system overheating is the most probable cause of the issue.\n\nNot C Distended capacitors\nDistended or swollen capacitors on the motherboard can indeed cause various issues, including unexpected shutdowns. However, the symptoms described in the scenario\u2014shutdowns occurring only when the laptop is moved from one room to another\u2014do not directly suggest a problem with the capacitors. While distended capacitors can lead to system instability and malfunctions, the symptoms described are more indicative of a mechanical issue related to movement, such as system overheating.

The vendor manages the various hardware platforms.\nSaaS - Software as a Service is the highest of these three levels.

In this question, the cloud storage is provisioned and deprovisioned automatically for the user, and thereby it would be categorized as on-demand."

Wired connections are working normally (implies the DHCP server is working but can't communicate to some machines, or there is an IP conflict) and 2. No machines experiencing issues have a static IP (implying the issue isn't an IP conflict).\nIt doesn't explicitly mention that the other machines are wireless but i think this is implied in the wording.\nSo we know DHCP CAN hand out IP addresses but there's a connection problem with ONLY wireless devices.

But slim chance of two drives in same mirror failing at the same time.  And RAID 10 offers faster data reads because it doesn't need to manage parity.\nNot C -- RAID 6 \u2013 striping with double parity - although more secure since it can withstand 2 drives dying simultaneously with no downtime - writes are slower than RAID 5 because of the additional parity data calculation. So worse performance. \nhttps://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid"

My chosen answer to this question are ACD and this is are my justifications: A immediately jumps to me because the \"OS loads and can be seen perfectly on the screen\" according to the question, right! Follow me on that, so your mobile computer boots and loads the OS perfectly. So now you you touch/tap an icon where you want to navigate on your screen right? So you tap on e.g Windows/My computer, you get no response...then do a swipe up, no response again then touch/tap tap tap a few other icons and that's when you realize yyour touchscreen is non-responsive"

However, the CompTIA Exam bears NO relation to \"Actual reality\" and the answers you must provide are the answers comptia has decided are \"correct\".  Therefore I have to update my suggested answer.  In the Official CompTia A+ core 1 220-1001 prayer guide and songbook Studyguide, in the troubleshooting laptop issues section, the troubleshooting steps for touchscreens says to rule out a software problem Before suspecting a more serious hardware problem. in other words, don't assume it's DOA or that the part didn't include a digitizer. It goes on to say: check the cable first, then reinstall the drivers, and then run the calibration utility.  B, C and D"

So if I plan for future VMs I would need to add more RAM instead of Storage, as this would be for normaly already enough...\nOr is the question more focusing on the HDD vs. SSD aspect? But the question not refers that only a HDD is in the system. \nAlso still RAM is more important than a SSD in my opinion.\n\nThanks and regards"

Same question was posted by Dion training on Udemy and the explaination makes the most sense. \n- Explanation: Since a RAID 5 has some built-in redundancy, it will continue to operate while in this degraded state without any additional redundancy since one of the drives has failed. It is best to schedule an authorized downtime period, replace the failed drive, rebuild the array, and confirm that the RAID is no longer reporting itself as degraded. During the rebuilding of the array, the system may perform extremely slowly, and users may experience a loss of service, which is why scheduling some downtime is necessary. Formatting the logical drive or changing a RAID 5 to a RAID 0 will cause data loss, and therefore they are not the correct answers."

If a router is running on 802.11g then it divides this range into various \"channels\" of 20MHz each (there's overlaps and gaps left etc but you get the idea) which gives you the channels you can select in your router settings to avoid transmitting on the same little block of frequency as anyone else around you.\nIn this context you are looking for frequency.

If the previous functionality was that it connected to the car radio automatically, then it can't be a USB plug, as this is a manual connection. If airplane mode was never enabled in the first place, then enabling it, just to disable it again won't do anything. The question is also asking what you should do NEXT, your next step should not be to rollback the phone's OS before checking if BT is enabled. Therefore, B is the correct answer."

It's not C, because you can view the messages. Easy so far.\n\nWith the others, I'm trying to follow their logic.\n\nWhat I think they mean is:\n\nWith B, you'd need and see a different port number than 25 on the SMTP side if it was SSL/TLS, and the question just says it's \"valid\", i.e. doesn't need changing.\n\nOption A then. Setting to POP3, if the IMAP isn't working properly in conjunction with the SMTP server, should then allow the \"valid\" SMTP server to function, which is especially true of some old email providers and old smartphones that would just download the mail preview content in a quick send/receive to then be used offline (saves mobile data?).\n\nThe badly worded question, or very old question.

(The question doesn't specify if it is or is not a rewriteable disk but  think this is the implication here as we're looking for the most likely cause.\n\nB: Files are encrypted - Doesn't matter, you're writing the data not trying to understand it.\n\nC: Corrupted file on hard drive - Possibly this would cause an error, however the question asks for the most likely and if he's \"backing up\" files it's likely files that are known to be good (NOT a guarantee just my interpretation)\n\nD: Files not compatible with type of disk - Doesn't make sense an optical disk is a data disk, as long as there is enough space for the file to fit we should be able to write the file (AFAIK, correct me if i'm wrong)\n\nLooking at it all i think we're meant to whittle it down to A or C to begin with, but out of the 2 I find A far more likely"

        "content": "You could, however, be upgrading from 8 GB DDR4 to 16 GB DDR4. This question is terrible. Undetected memory errors can result in no consequences, or permanent corruption of data/machine crash. Parity will only detect the error and not correct it. For correction on the fly you need ECC. When a parity error is detected, the motherboard parity-checking circuits generate a nonmaskable interrupt (NMI), which halts processing and diverts the system's attention to the error. In some older systems, parity-check routine halts the CPU and causes the system to lock up, leaving you to perform a hardware reset. Meaning all your work is lost. The idea for parity is to catch RAM errors before they become catastrophic and allow you to schedule downtime to replace it. Most systems don't halt the CPU when parity error is detected; instead, they offer the choice of rebooting the system or continuing as though nothing happened. Parity will not reduce downtime and is not a \"type of RAM\" but a FEATURE built into certain TYPES of RAM.\n\nLRDIMMs are a load-reduction DIMM used in servers to reduce load on the server memory bus. This has noting to do with preventing downtime."

Toner is the generic term for two separate devices that are used together: a tone generator and a tone probe. The tone generator connects to the cable using alligator clips, tiny hooks, or a network jack, and it sends an\nelectrical signal along the wire at a certain frequency. The tone probe emits a sound when it is placed near a cable connected to the tone generator. These two devices are often referred to by the brand-name Fox and Hound, a popular model of toner made by the Triplett Corporation."

In the past, the 250 MHz performance provided by CAT6 was often achieved by using a nylon spline in the wiring, which isolated each of the four twisted pairs, making the cable rigid. Nowadays, CAT6 cables are more flexible, using other methods to reduce noise.\n\nRegardless of whether a spline is used, CAT6 features more stringent specifications for crosstalk and system noise. Not only does CAT6 provide significantly lower interference or Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT) in the transmission compared to CAT5e, it also improves Equal-Level Far-End Crosstalk (ELFEXT), Return Loss (RL) and Insertion Loss (IL). The result is less system noise, fewer errors and higher data transmission rates."

The virtual machine in this case can be on a thick client and only have the applications it needs streamed to it virtually. The thin client can have all the software and apps on the server machine it is connected to but only the hardware needed to function. What had me confused to was the fact that thin clients and virtual machines are used together and it confuses people to have it separate. Thin client only required hardware. Virtual machine only required software or apps."

In general DHCP reservation is preferable because it automates and reduces the chances of IP conflict. If you are given a question about IP conflict and these two options appear, go for a DHCP reservation. \n\nCompTIA is aware of this hence why they only leave you with static IP in the question."

Since the user wants to check a document but now doesn't have their USB mouse connected to move the cursor - the next best thing is the \"built-in peripherals\" which would be the touch-pad (they stated the user uses a laptop) used to control the cursor.\n\nThe function key being stuck has nothing to do with trying to get to the document - which requires a cursor and clicking and maybe the windows button and E as a shortcut to get to the File explorer. besides that, it's cursor movement and clicking.\n\nHope this makes helps and makes sense to you as this is what led me to the answer B."

When you see vertical lines on page, first of all, I pretty much guarantee we're talking laser printers here because it's a big issue with 'em. A vertical line on a page for a laser printer almost always points to there's foreign matter on your optically sensitive roller. You'll get little pieces of paper, little pieces of string that will actually wrap around it, and that's going to corrupt the image, and every time you print something you're going to get a line there. And the answer is you yank the toner cartridge and you throw it in the garbage. It is impossible to take like a pair of scissors or something and try to cut away that debris. The thing is simply too sensitive and just touching it with a piece of metal can usually force it to never be able to really print properly again. be able to really print properly again. \""

Increased memory requirements for the new OS is resulting in applications not having access to enough memory. \n\nThe windows machine is having to rely on the page file constantly. The page file uses disk storage and this is resulting in the constant activity of the disk and of course slow down because hard drive speed is much slower than RAM. While the question does not mention Ram. CompTIA wants you to recognize concepts like memory requirements for software and OS, the speed of a hard drive vs the speed of Ram among other concepts."

That should still let you get some real work done. \n\nAlso, the first solution should most definitely not be flashing your bios.

Not to mention flashing a bio is a dangerous procedure so you better know what you are doing. \n\nEven if we suppose updating the bios made sense, then you still have to update your data because there are cases where the bios don't work with your hard drive and it can blow your data away."

Ram can be incompatible physically and electronically. If it's incompatible physically it isn't going to even be on the motherboard. If it's incompatible electronically it will most likely post but not be at the right frequency or be at a lower clock speed. It is unlikely that it would not post probably not impossible but unlikely. I've seen questions like this before regarding PC upgrades and PC not posting. Seems like CompTIA wants you to know that bios updates can make sure PC parts like the processor are compatible which is true. I would go with CPU support as the issue."

Assuming it's a standard 802.11 wireless network, like connecting a refrigerator or maybe a camera, one of the things you must configure is the passphrase to log onto a network. Port forwarding is something that may be automatically done through UPNP or manually if you want remote access to devices but the vast majority of devices may not be accessed from outside of a local network. The question doesn't even address that. It seems to just address getting the devices On the local network."

RAID 10 can technically allow two drive failures, but they would have to be two specific drives to allow continued function after the drive failures(i.e Lose half of each subset, you're OK.

Check the RJ45 end connectors, the jacks, and the ends of the run of the Cat 5 UTP cable for loose connections, pinched bends, and visible damage.\n\nThe flashing green LED on the NIC indicates that the NIC is receiving power, and the flashing orange LED indicates that the NIC is attempting to establish a network connection. Since the technician installed a Cat 5 UTP cable for this connection, the issue is most likely related to the cable or the connectors. Therefore, the technician should first check the RJ45 end connectors, the jacks, and the ends of the run of the Cat 5 UTP cable for loose connections, pinched bends, and visible damage."

Check the RJ45 end connectors, the jacks, and the ends of the run of the Cat 5 UTP cable for loose connections, pinched bends, and visible damage.\n\nThe flashing green LED on the workstation's NIC typically indicates that the link is up, which means that the NIC is detecting a physical connection to the network. The flashing orange LED usually indicates that data is being transmitted or received on the network.\n\nHowever, the fact that both LEDs are flashing does not necessarily mean that the network connection is working properly. The most common cause of connectivity issues with a UTP cable is a poor physical connection. This can be caused by loose connections, pinched bends, or damage to the cable or connectors.\n\nTherefore, before attempting any other troubleshooting steps, the technician should check the cable and connectors for any visible damage or loose connections. If any issues are found, they should be corrected before proceeding with further troubleshooting."

This can result in significantly faster application loading times and improved overall system performance compared to an HDD."

These interfaces can provide high-speed data transfer rates, but they are typically more expensive and less commonly used in workstations than M.2 SSDs.\n\nA traditional hard disk drive (Option C) is a type of mechanical storage device that uses spinning disks to store data. While HDDs are still commonly used for large-scale data storage, they are significantly slower than SSDs, especially when it comes to accessing frequently used applications and data.\n\nBy installing an M.2 SSD, the technician can improve the workstation's response time for frequently used applications and data without removing the current hard drive, which can be used for additional storage capacity."
