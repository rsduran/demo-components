It just exits saying nothing to do package already installed, even if you've done a yum check-upgrade and can see an newer version of the package is available. You either need to supply the specific newer version number as a suffix to the package name or use the command 'yum install --best [packagename]' to update the package to whatever the latest version available is.\n\nB. 'yum upgrade' will upgrade all packages for which newer versions are available, which is not exactly was asked for. 'yum upgrade [packagename]' would accomplish what was asked by updating only the named package (and any of its dependencies).\n\nC. uninstalls (e=erase) the named package. Not correct.\n\nD. 'rpm -qa' displays ALL installed packages and their versions. It works but is messy. Instead 'rpm -q [packagename]' will display the version of the package requested and nothing more.\n\nE/F. apt-get is the wrong tool here."

I was thinking it'd be `rpm -e &lt;package name&gt;` because I had no idea what -e did, it just looked more right to me than the nonsense that is using `rpm -qa` to check for a single RPM.

The su Command\n\nUpon typing the su command, the user is prompted for the root password and, after authentication, is given a root shell prompt.\n\nOnce logged in via the su command, the user is the root user and has absolute administrative access to the system. In addition, once a user has become root, it is possible for them to use the su command to change to any other user on the system without being prompted for a password.\n\nBecause this program is so powerful, administrators within an organization may wish to limit who has access to the command.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to do this is to add users to the special administrative group called wheel. To do this, type the following command as root:\n\nusermod -G wheel &lt;username&gt;\n\nIn the previous command, replace &lt;username&gt; with the username you want to add to the wheel group.\n\nTo use the User Manager for this purpose, go to the Main Menu Button (on the Panel) =&gt; System Settings =&gt; Users &amp; Groups or type the command system-config-users at a shell prompt. Select the Users tab, select the user from the user list, and click Properties from the button menu (or choose File =&gt; Properties from the pull-down menu)."

I mean since the system is automatically managing the configuration, that seems like the correct answer whereas build automation refers to the process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes including: compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.

To me that means whole disk. Coupled by the fact that if we were to be copying all of sdc, A matches C with the exception being C. is only a single partition on the disk. If I am asked this I would go with A. Only thing kinda throwing me off is block size is 512 by default in most distros. Honestly this is less about knowing the commands and more about knowing exactly what Comptia wants."
