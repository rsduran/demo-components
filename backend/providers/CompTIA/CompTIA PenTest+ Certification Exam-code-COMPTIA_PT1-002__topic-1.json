There's an article linked when you click \"Reveal Solution\" that goes more in depth with it, but the gist is: these older protocols can cause system malfunctions if scanned with modern tools. So, it's how the scan itself is a safety risk...not so much the devices. Terrible question, CompTia."

Wiberg states that active tools such as Nmap can use unusual TCP segment data to try and find available ports. Furthermore, they can open a massive amount of connections with a specific SCADA device but then fail to close them gracefully.\" \nAnd since SCADA and ICS devices are designed and implemented with little attention having been paid to the operational security of these devices and their ability to handle errors or unexpected events, the presence idle open connections may result into errors that cannot be handled by the devices.\n\nThis will result into failure of the normal operation of the SCADA causing the physical world effects. This, AGAIN, brings me to be D as the right Answer."

It is recommended to disable SSH if it is not required or upgrade to a more secure and up-to-date version. This helps mitigate potential security vulnerabilities associated with older versions of SSH.\n\nF. Eliminate network management and control interfaces: The finding that network management interfaces are available on the production network indicates a potential security risk. It is generally recommended to separate network management traffic onto a dedicated out-of-band network, separate from the production network. By creating an out-of-band network for management purposes, the risk of unauthorized access or interference with critical network devices can be reduced."

This attack takes advantage of how many switches process tags. \nMost switches will only remove the outer tag and forward the frame to all native VLAN ports. With that said, this exploit is only successful if the attacker belongs to the native VLAN of the trunk link.\nhttps://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/vlan-hopping-and-mitigation"

In this case, the SOC (Security Operations Center) implemented sinkholing on the penetration tester's IP address, effectively preventing network traffic from reaching the tester's system.\nThe reason for this action can be attributed to a failure in the planning process. When conducting a penetration test, it is essential to have clear communication and coordination between the penetration tester, the client, and any involved teams or departments. The failure to notify the SOC about the penetration test or to coordinate with them properly resulted in the sinkholing of the tester's IP address."

Finally, -T4 enables a more aggressive timing policy to speed up the scan.\n\nExample 4.3. More complex: nmap -p0- -v -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org\"\nhttps://nmap.org/book/port-scanning-tutorial.html\n\nI'm not 100%... based on NMAP documentation, both A and C seem to be viable answers. -p0 will not flag the IDS MOST LIKELY since they are T0 scans (paranoid) and running -Ss, this is common knowledge. On the other hand, you have nmap documentation that specifically has -f and --badsum under the IDS/FIREWALL EVASION page... ahhh, what to choose. Thanks CompTIA."

It can scan for known vulnerabilities on open ports and services, and can also check for specific vulnerabilities based on the version of the software running on the target system. Once vulnerabilities are identified, OpenVAS can also provide information about potential exploits that could be used to exploit those vulnerabilities.\n\nAfter identifying the open ports and services with Nmap, the next step is to check if there are any known vulnerabilities on those open ports, OpenVAS is a suitable tool to do that. Other tools such as Drozer and Burp Suite, can be used for testing the security of Android and web applications respectively, but they are not suitable for vulnerability scanning. OWASP ZAP is also a web application security scanner, it can be used to find vulnerabilities on web applications, but it's not suitable for vulnerability scanning on ports."

In addition to the financial impact of recovery fees and possible\nloss of intellectual property, a company that suffers from an attack can face fines,\npenalties, and legal action.\nAs a result, it\u2019s important to recognize the cloud computing infrastructure is\nsusceptible to several types of attacks that include:\nSide-channel attacks: Also called a sidebar or implementation attack, this\nexploit is possible because of the shared nature of the cloud infrastructure,\nespecially in a PaaS model. In this attack, the hardware leaks sensitive\ninformation such as cryptographic keys, via a covert channel, to a potential\nattacker."

In cases where there exist shared hardware resources, the side channel attack exploits information obtained from the usage of, for example, Central Processing Unit (CPU) core and high level cache memory as opposed to exploiting theoretical weaknesses like the brute force attack. \n\nRef: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01356.pdf"
