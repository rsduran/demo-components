Only the friends who know this secret handshake can enter the clubhouse. This way, even if someone finds the door, they can\u2019t get in unless they know the secret handshake. So, using the secret handshake (Option F) is a better way to keep your clubhouse safe than just moving the door (Option A). It\u2019s a stronger way to make sure only your friends can get in."

The answers indicate there is more than one antivirus client installed on this computer.\nRemoving the user-installed antivirus is the most correct answer. Multiple antivirus products can congest CPU and RAM resources and may trigger each other when they read the other's virus database.\nActivating real-time protection on both antivirus programs is incorrect. See above.\nRunning OS updates is incorrect as there is no indication nor posited theory that the OS itself is causing the slowdown.\nEnabling quarantine features on both antivirus programs is incorrect. Again, more than one antivirus program active on a system can cause them to clash."

These alerts would either be created at the network-attached storage (NAS) device or at the individual servers to be backed up. If and admin receives an alert, that person will know to either rerun the back up or (more likely) fix the backup task and the run it. One of the issues here is that you might not know if a backup fails- without the alerts, that is.\nIncorrect answers: Setting up scripts is good for the backup processes themselves, but you first need to be alerted to an issue before you can script a rerun of the failed backup. In this case, the backups are being stored to a NAS device (on the LAN), so they are  not being stored offsite. You should always test a backup the first time it runs and periodically afterwards; however, frequent restoration tests are very time-consuming, not to mention hardware-intensive to the NAS device. Restoring to VM is a good way to test, but it's not good way to ensure rapid recovery, nor is it where the backups are supposed to be restored to; the question says \"physical servers.\"\nCompTIA A+ Practice Questions Exam Cram Core 1 and Core 2"

The Processes tab more than anything else, because it lets you quickly see how system resources are utilized, which can be very helpful when trying to troubleshoot applications or find out why the computer is suddenly performing slowly. The Task Manager can be used to identify and stop processes that use excessive system resources and to keep the computer operating at high speeds."

The Processes tab offers a closer look at what might be contributing to the problem and provides a rundown of which processes are taking up the most power and RAM, which is key for figuring out how to lower CPU usage. From there, you can then either stop the processes that are using up disproportionate resources, or, if the process in question isn\u2019t normally such a drain on CPU and memory, work to fix the underlying issues."

One example of a MITM attack is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. Spoofing is often used as a method of injecting the attacker into the conversation path between the two parties."

Frankly, they're forcing you to make a lot of assumptions, but it could be EITHER a worm or a virus, either one could create Zombies, or form a Botnet by turning networked computers into Zombies, but Zombies and Botnet are two different things. Botnets are clusters of Zombies working in sync. Zombies are not necessarily working in sync, doing the same tasks simultaneously; a network of Zombies is not inherently a Botnet, unless they are performing the same task simultaneously. The actual answers, based on the content in the question (because the question doesn't detail attack vector traits) would be Zombies or Botnet. If they question had detailed HOW these computers had possibly been infected to perform these actions, the answers would be Virus and/or Worm. As it stands, either one could be the possible culprit, so the answers Virus and Worm, Virus and Botnet, Worm and Zombies, Worm and Botnet, Virus and Zombies, or Botnet and Zombies are all equally correct!"

Most cases of a power surge/spike, the buildings power panel will throw breakers to avoid the surge from causing fire by overheating the wires and outlets as well as protecting any machines plugged into those sockets. However, that safety feature is not without faults. That is where the surge protectors come in. With that said, if the breakers were to flip to cut the circuit, you then have no power which will result in the missing time in the event logs. A power recycle of a machine turning off and back on will still log the occurrence in the event logs.

They list a number of other operations before they finally get to the \"remove applications from startup\" operation.  \n\nI was pretty stumped by this one, because the two choices (defragment and cleanup) are so similar and have equal effect on system performance.

From there you will see the Camera app; tap it to find out which applications are using it. Then, you can deselect whichever apps you need to. You might also find a malicious or unwanted program is on the list and enabled for camera usage\u2013if so, it should be removed.\""

A brownout is a reduction in or restriction on the availability of electrical power in a particular area. The irregular power supply during the brownout can ruin your computer and other electronic devices. Electronics are created to operate at specific voltages, so any fluctuations in power (both up and down) can damage them. To protect against a brownout, you can use either a battery backup or a line conditioner. To protect against a blackout, a battery backup should be used.\n\nSo, I'll stick with battery backup as it protects against blackouts too and cross my fingers they don't give me this question, or give me the option to choose two answers."

Your device needs to request a new DNS resolution from the wifi provider, which provides you with its own ip address, and then sends you on to your desired site once you click the \"I accept\" button. \n\nIf your computer/device is trying to load a site which it has loaded recently, it would have a cached DNS record for, and would not try to re-request it from the hotspot, and thus the page would not be displayed.   \n\nThe solution is to open your browser and try to load a site you never go to, like ask.com for example.  the AUP would now load and you can authenticate and get on with it."

Jason Dion has a practice question just like this one:OBJ-2.10: Since Dion Training wants to keep the wireless network open, the BEST option is to reduce the signal strength of the network's power level. This will ensure the wireless network can only be accessed from within its classrooms and not from the coffee shop next door. Changing the SSID won't prevent the coffee shop's customers from accessing the network. While MAC filtering could be used to create an approved whitelist of MAC addresses for all Dion Training's students, this would also require it to be continuously updated with each class of students that is very time-intensive and inefficient. Therefore, the BEST solution is to reduce the signal strength."

The main problem with this approach is that it requires careful configuration to ensure that there is acceptable coverage for legitimate users. You also expose yourself slightly to \"evil twin\" attacks, as users may expect to find the network at a given location and assume that a rogue AP is legitimate.\n\nTherefore the answers must be A and F.

Server then opens a backdoor(a layer 4) TCP port on the victims machine. This server can be designed in way to brute force open a port on HIPS(host based firewalls etc)(windows firewall for example). \n\nOnce the server opens this port on victims node, it listens to the socket(IP:port) on the local system(victim). \n\nThe client side of the trojan controlled by the attacker, makes connection to the server.

Rootkit :\nRootkit is a set of application, a type of malware that is designed to infect a target PC and allow an attacker to install a set of tools that grant him persistent remote access to the computer. The malware typically pretended itself as normal files that \u201chide in plain sight\u201d so your antivirus software overlooks them. It enables administrator-level access to a computer or computer network. The motive is to steal the identity information from your computer, often to gain control of a system. It is difficult to detect and remove, requires the specialized tools to remove.\n\n2. Trojan Horse :\nTrojan Horse is also a type of malware which uses false and fake name for mislead users from its true intent and executing them. Trojan Horses generally install on the system as legitimate and useful software that can give unauthorized access and control of the system to the hackers. Back orifice, Rootkit and Beast Trojan are some of the common Trojan horse which is more harmful."

With Windows 7, setting up a PXE installation required a significant amount of configuration and manual setup. However, with Windows 10, the process has been greatly simplified through the use of the Windows Deployment Services (WDS) role in Server Manager."

Radio Power Levels\nSome wireless routers and access points have adjustable radio power levels. When they are set too low, clients at the perimeter of the building will not be able to gain access. When they are set too high, computers located in neighboring businesses will be able to attempt access. If a wireless signal is too weak, regardless of the router location and radio power levels, and the router is older, consider replacing it with a new wireless router."

It sounds like something you might want to do if giving away a hard disk or perhaps discarding an old computer that may have contained useful and important private information. Standard formatting of the drives could allow for the data to be restored and could make the data vulnerable to exposure. Drilling or hammers the HDD platters would physically destroy the drives and the data, but it would make the laptops useful for the community center. Degaussing the drives would also render the drives useless to the community center. Therefore, the safest method is a low-level format since it fully destroys the data and allows the drives to be reused by the community center."

From a similar question with just minor details changed, here's the explanation:\n\nOBJ-1.3: An in-place upgrade will preserve all of the user's files and applications during the upgrade process from Windows 8 to Windows 10. A clean installation will completely format the hard drive (losing all of the files and applications) and then install a new copy of Windows 10. A reset upgrade will keep the user's data files, but not the applications on the system. An unattended installation is used to perform a clean install and use the configurations from an answers file instead of an interactive session with the installer."

First you would have to disassemble the drive to access the platters themselves. Any pieces that remained after you finished attacking the device would still contain data. (And it\u2019s entirely too likely that you would end up with an embarrassing injury to pair with your lack of results.)\n\nThe Definitive Destruction Method: Shredding\nInstead of drilling holes in hard drives or attempting any other DIY method of destroying hard drives, skip straight to the one method that guarantees permanent success. Shredding is the most effective way to destroy drives so that the data stored on them can never be reconstructed. \nhttps://www.examtopics.com/exams/comptia/220-1002/view/10/"

Clearly, a metal hard drive has no place in the microwave\u2014but that hasn\u2019t stopped dozens of people from posting YouTube videos of themselves trying it. \n\nIneffective Destruction Method #4: Using Strong Magnets\nDegaussing is the process of using magnets to destroy a magnetic field, scrambling any information stored there so it becomes unusable. Because hard drive platters use magnetized data, degaussing can actually be an effective way to destroy that data and make it unreadable. The catch is that degaussing requires magnets much stronger than the ones most people have access to. The commercial magnets that a business may have on its premises probably aren\u2019t going to cause enough damage."

Surely no computer would be able to read a drive that\u2019s littered with physical holes, right? It\u2019s true that your personal computer probably won\u2019t be able to read a drive that looks like Swiss cheese. The heat from the drill might even cause damage that permanently warps the drive. But as long as there are intact sections of hard drive platters, the data stored on those sections is still technically accessible. \n\nIneffective Destruction Method #2: Submerging Drives in Water\nYour cell phone will probably still work after you drop it in water, and so will a hard drive. Even if you leave hard drives to soak in water for hours, it\u2019s unlikely that this will do anything to permanently destroy data."

A technician is dispatched to remove the malware from this workstation, and after its removal, the technician provides the factory worker with a new USB drive to move the pattern files to the workstation.

Checking that everything is connected will properly alieve a surprising amount of issues.\n\n4. Check the status\nIn some instances, the printer will tell you exactly what is wrong with it. Go to the Control Panel and select Devices and Printers. Click on the printer that is having problems. It will usually tell you what is wrong.\n\n5. Check the print queue\nMake sure someone else hasn\u2019t clogged the queue with a bunch of print jobs. If you have permissions, clearing problematic print jobs can get the printer back up and running.\n\n6. Invest in a new printer\nThis, of course, won\u2019t help immediately if you need something printed and your machine is giving you grief, but it will prevent a great many more complicated issues later on"

Disk wiping software ensures that old data is destroyed by writing to each location on the media, either using zeroes or in a random pattern. This leaves the disk in a \"clean\" state ready to be passed to the new owner. This overwriting method is suitable for all but the most confidential data (like top-secret documents about terrorism, national security etc.), but is time-consuming and requires special software. \n\nLOW LEVEL FORMAT\nMost disk vendors supply tools to reset a disk to its factory condition. These are often described as low level format tools and will have the same sort of effect as disk wiping software. A \"proper\" low level format creates cylinders and sectors on the disk. This can generally only be done at the factory. The disk utilities just clean data from each sector; they don't re-create the sector layout."

You would need to restore the user\u2019s files from a backup taken prior to the virus. And from my personal experience in IT support, restoring a system from an image (usually via PXE over the network) can take up to an hour or more. If roaming profiles are not being used then all of the user\u2019s profile settings (desktop, favorites, downloads, etc) will be lost \u2013 so these things together are not a MINIMAL impact to the user.]"

In these cases changing the folder share permissions would correct the problem such as \u201callow\u201d the user directly or create an exception/workaround to the implicit deny for their account.

One can argue, that such BiOS backup is part of a backout plan but technically you're restoring from a backup rather than going in reverse the steps that lead to a failure."

BranchCache is available on Windows 7, 8, and 10 and some Windows Server versions. The beauty of BranchCache is that whenever a user accesses content from a remote server or cloud server, that information is stored locally. The next time the user needs to access that content, the information is\nretrieved faster and without using WAN resources. If another user needs that same information, that user retrieves it from the local storage and doesn\u2019t use WAN resources either. Only authorized users can access the information, so even though it is stored locally, it is secure."

The user's settings have been reset and files/mapped drives are not appearing, this points towards a corrupted user profile. The steps to rebuild the profile are to delete the registry entry for the user and to delete or rename to user's folder then reboot and log in again. Once you log in again the profile will be automatically rebuilt and you can transfer back any files from the renamed folder (as long as you didn't delete it). As  vapoodlized  said this is covered in Professor Messer's videos on troubleshooting in some detail, however the profile has not yet been deleted as he suggested, that is what you need to do to fix the problem."

The implication is that there is malware on the machine that has configured your browser to run every request through a malicious proxy server, a classic way to try to grab credentials. If this is the case then the user is seeing this error because they are being passed a bad certificate, most likely from the malicious proxy server in an attempt to bypass SSL so they can see any login details you use.\nThe time and date solution is much more likely but i guess would come under the 1001 learning objectives instead of the core 1002."

Often, smart cards are used as part of a multifactor authentication system where the smart card and a PIN needs to be entered for system authentication to occur."

The book also describes there are 2 different types of Low-level formatting. One can be done w/ special software by a user and one is done at the factory.

As drives became\nmore complex, hard drive manufacturers disabled the ability to perform low-\nlevel formats outside the factory.\nToday, the term \u201clow-level formatting\u201d is often used to describe a zero-fill\nor overwrite operation. This process returns the drive to a state as close to\nlike-new as possible by writing zeros to every location on the drive."

I don't see why the computer name would have to be updated on an inventory document. The company would have tracking labels on their computers, not reliant on the system name. I lean towards AUP for renaming a company computer. \nFrom Comptia:\nThere are many software suites and associated hardware solutions available for tracking and managing assets (or inventory). An asset management database can be configured to store as much or as little information as is deemed necessary, though typical data would be type, model, serial number, asset ID, location, user(s), value, and service information. Tangible assets can be identified using a barcode label or Radio Frequency ID (RFID) tag attached to the device (or more simply using an identification number)."

An AUP clearly states what the user is and is not allowed to do with the these resources.\n\nAn AUP is very similar to the ubiquitous terms and conditions or end-user license agreements (EULA) found on almost all software applications. The main difference is that an AUP covers the use of a much larger shared computing resource, such as an LAN or website, as opposed to a single software item. One consequence of sharing is that an AUP typically goes into detail about etiquette and respect for fellow users of the resource, which is not applicable for single-user software applications."

Some environments like to name all their group policy objects starting with GPO_ and all their Security Groups with ACL_, others uses # at the start of Security Group names. It doesn't really matter what you use, as long as there's some sort of system."

Every component of the drive must be thoroughly destroyed, which is why incineration is the right answer. A high enough temperature will disrupt circuit paths and melt the chips within. An industrial mechanical shredder would also be a feasible destruction method. The drive manufacturer may offer their own solutions on their website."

Could be lack of current overall, could be blown fuses from the generator kicking in tbh or could be a few other things. Either way harder to diagnose and unlikely to be fixed by diverting more power.\n\nEntire floor - This would imply something has happened to the power coming to this floor, could be and RCD on the generator blew, could be a rat chewed the cable (remember this is backup cabling so the connections to the mains havent been used for a while). This WOULD be fixed by diverting power from another floor because you've bypassed the damaged part of the circuit. In this event adding redundancy to the cabling would actually have helped, if there was a redundant ;ink to the mains then there would still have been power going to those floors."

It asks how you gain access to the physical computer itself and that is hinted to by the fact that building access and gate access can use key fobs all the time as a alternative to a badge reader card/smart card or keys. So the answer is D because it gives us access to the building and then the door to the room with the computer in it.

If you\u2019re waiting on a printout at a printer and suddenly there\u2019s a bunch of printed pages coming out of the printer with employee payroll information, set it to the side and pretend you never saw it.\n\nSo based on this info, I would choose C and set it aside.

In fact a lot of people reccomend NOT to defrag an SSD because they have a finite amount of write cycles in their lifetime and defragmenting would use up write operations for no benefit."

It centralizes the management of users and computers.\nPeer-to-peer - Workgroups and domains are logical groupings of computers. A workgroup\n(sometimes also referred to as peer-to-peer) is usually a small group of com-\nputers that share the same network name. No one computer controls the net-\nwork, and all systems are considered equal. One of the disadvantages is that a\ncomputer storing data can be accessed only by a maximum of 20 other systems\nsimultaneously.\nSounds to me more like a workgroup being saved on another workstation (as opposed to a server) so I will go with D for this one. Still not 100% confident though."

The only people who don\u2019t agree with this are the spammers themselves. One of the tricks that spammers use is to spoof (or fake) the domain name they are sending emails from. DNS, through the use of TXT records, can help email servers determine if incoming messages are from a trusted source rather than a spoofed one.\nThree standards used to battle email spam are Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain\nKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,\nand Conformance (DMARC). Each one can be used in a DNS TXT record to help thwart\nmalicious users from using a company\u2019s domain name to send unauthorized emails."

Email filtering is any technique used to prevent a user from being overwhelmed with spam or junk email. Spam can be blocked from reaching an organization using a mail gateway to filter messages. Anti-spam filtering needs to balance blocking illegitimate traffic with permitting legitimate messages. Anti-spam techniques can also use lists of known spam servers by establishing a blocklist. If an allow list is used, only a small number of senders could send emails to the user. The technician should not create a domain-based email filter since the spammers are using Yahoo, Gmail, and Hotmail accounts to send the spam. If a domain-based email filter is created, it will block emails from all users on those email providers and prevent legitimate emails from being received."

Phishing\nSocial engineering is a process in which an attacker attempts to acquire information about your network and system by social means, such as by talking to people in the organization. A social engineering attack may occur over the phone, by email, or by a visit. The intent is to acquire access information, such as user IDs and passwords. When the attempt is made through email or instant messaging, it is known as phishing and often is made to look as if it is coming from sites where users are likely to have accounts."

If the certificate is valid and comes from an authentic certificate provider, your browser confirms that the site is secure and displays a padlock icon in the address bar. This certificate ensures that the website is indeed a legitimate one and not a fake site set up by malicious actors.\nSo, in summary, the browser relies on certificates to establish the authenticity of the remote site when accessing an HTTPS website."

Change the default credentials to unique, strong ones to prevent unauthorised access.\n\n2.\tUpdate Router Firmware:\nRegularly update your router\u2019s firmware to patch security vulnerabilities. Newer firmware versions often include security enhancements and bug fixes.\nHowever, keep in mind that some older routers may not receive updates, so consider upgrading to a more recent model if necessary."

On modern systems, the file system on the boot drive has support\nfor an access control list (ACL), a rich form of user and groups permissions.\nBut this security only extends to drives/cards formatted with modern file\nsystems such as NTFS, HFS+, and ext3/4.\"\n\nDLP (again from Meyers)\n\"any security appliances include a context-based set of rules called\nData Loss Prevention (DLP) to help companies avoid accidental leakage of\ndata.

Each object has a security attribute that identifies its access control list. The list has an entry for each system user with access privileges. The most common privileges include the ability to read a file (or all the files in a directory), to write to the file or files, and to execute the file (if it is an executable file, or program). Microsoft Windows NT/2000, Novell's NetWare, Digital's OpenVMS, and UNIX-based systems are among the operating systems that use access control lists. The list is implemented differently by each operating system\nWhat us DLP?Data loss prevention (DLP) makes sure that users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network.

Would you like to configure your system so that the Accounting group can only log on between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M.? There\u2019s a security policy for that. How about forcing anyone who logs on to your system to use a password that\u2019s at least eight characters long? There\u2019s a security policy for that as well.
