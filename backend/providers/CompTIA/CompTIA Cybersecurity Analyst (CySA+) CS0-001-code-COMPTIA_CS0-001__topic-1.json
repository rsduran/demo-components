If it means disable services through a firewall or something.. then why would the answer just be firewalling lol."

You have to put them in their own network! Segmentation goes first, that's a no-brainer. But what next? The next obvious step really is putting a Firewall in place. Limiting the amount of connections towards the SCADA devices (from the admin network to the scada network) and limiting the amount of ports that can be reached out to. After all that, it's time to disable unused services. And after that it's patching. And after that it's continuous monitoring. Etc etc etc..."

The solution is to disable use of SSL 3.0 in servers.\n\nDROWN is different - it doesn't directly interfere with the client's connection. Instead, DROWN is an attack on an even older protocol version, SSL 2.0, which is still supported by many servers. It works on any server that uses the same private keys for SSL 2.0 and higher versions of SSL/TLS (likely). The attacker connects using SSL 2.0, and is able to eventually determine the secret session keys of a currently connected user session (which might be using TLS 1.2). This enables the attacker to decrypt the user's current session data. Here the solution is to disable support for SSL 2.0."

Also, both Server 1 and Server 4 have exactly the same communication with the same IP addresses, for the same ports (3389, or RDP) which leads me to believe that these machines are being managed remotely by a server administrator. In fact, I believe this is a hint here. The server admins are not connecting to Server 2, so I feel like that one is already out of the question because the server admins aren't even looking into that one. They want to know which of the two remaining servers has malware. We're seeing a connection between Server 1 and Server 4 in which notepad.exe (on Server 1) is connecting to port 443 on Server 4). Server 4 could be a webserver (svchost.exe has been known to listen on weirder ports than 443) and Server 1 (on the DMZ) might be trying to find a way into the internal network through Server 4.\n\nSo again, I'm thinking Server 1 and Notepad.exe.

Look at this line from Cybersecurity Analyst Certification Bundle:\n\n\"A very straightforward and perhaps tempting approach would be to look at the lengthiest legal or regulatory retention requirement on your organization and then apply that timeframe to all your data retention. The problem with this is that it will probably make your retained data set orders of magnitude greater than it needs to be. Not only does this impose additional storage costs, but it also makes it more difficult to comply with electronic discovery (e-discovery) orders. A better approach is to find the specific data sets that have mandated retention requirements and handle those accordingly. Everything else has a retention period that minimally satisfies the business requirements.\""

It pays, then, to treat each incident as if it will eventually end up in a court of justice.\nOnce all relevant evidence is captured, we fix all that was broken. The aim is to restore full, trustworthy functionality to the organization. For hosts that were compromised, the best practice is to simply reinstall the system from a gold master image and then restore data from the most recent backup that occurred prior to the attack.\""

The last column to be created is the Description column.\n\nAs for the answer being C, I would argue that C and D both contain the same data and the same data types.  The only difference between C and D is the width of the Type column.  However, the CREATE TABLE statement fails to specify a width which leads me to believe that either C or D would be the answer minus the Primarykey column.

Take a closer look at the vulnerability scan result stating \"SSL Expiration Less Than 90 Days\".\n\nFirstly, we do not know the exact day left till the actual expiry date of the certificate. The best practice is to avoid doing any last minute renewal, how can it be done, by renewing the certificate beforehand prior to the expired date.\n\nSecondly, we also do know that requesting to renew the certificate will take up some time such as the Certificate Authority will have to approve your renew application and etc. before reissuing you your new certificate.\n\nThirdly, the question also did state \"BEST addresses these finding\", if you choose option A by revoking and reissuing to match the hostname, that will resolved your issue temporarily but you'll eventually have to go back to option D because you did not fix the problem of the expiring certificate.\n\nLogically, you want to fix the root cause of the problem rather than the symptoms shown.\n\nhttps://docs.digicert.com/manage-certificates/renew-ssltls-certificate/"

This is a source of vulnerabilities because updating this software cannot normally be done automatically or even centrally. The patching and updating, which is pretty infrequent to begin with, typically requires that the device be brought offline and manually updated by a qualified technician. Between the cost and effort involved and the effects of interrupting business processes, it should not come as a surprise to learn that many ICS components are never updated or patched. To make matters worse, vendors are notorious for not providing patches at all, even when vulnerabilities are discovered and made public. In its 2016 report on ICS security, FireEye described how 516 of the 1552 known ICS vulnerabilities had no patch available.\""

Adversaries don\u2019t want to duplicate efforts or exfiltration streams because such duplication would also make them easier to detect. Instead, they will typically coordinate activities within a compromised network. This means that even if multiple agents are searching for sensitive files in different subnets, they will tend to copy those files at the coordination hub at which they are staged, prepared, and relayed to an external repository. Unfortunately, these internal flows will usually be difficult to detect because they may resemble legitimate functions of the organization.\""

This process helps identify potential security weaknesses, misconfigurations, or outdated software versions that could be exploited by attackers. By conducting regular vulnerability scans, the analyst can stay informed about any vulnerabilities and take appropriate actions to mitigate or remediate them."
