That swapping the fiber pairs at either end will MOST likely fix the issue in almost every SFP related question? Or are they ACTUALLY being more specific than that?\n\nAs is the way with so many CompTIA questions, this one forces us to make too many assumptions.\n\nIf we assume that the use of multimode fiber for the trunk was by design, and the sfp in the Access switch is NOT extended range, then the sfp in the core switch would need to be replaced with a standard range to match. It's two against one. Fix the single point of failure. \nBut which of the answers provided looks the most like \"replace the core switch's SFP with a standard range SFP\"? \n Does \"Install an optic that matches the fiber type\" work? \nSo we are forced to assume that they used to word optic to be short for \"10Gb SFP optical transceiver\". \n\nAnd this is why CompTIA sucks."

Instead, with the Static PAT, the users can just type \u201cwww.site.com\u201d (which implicitly assumes the standard web port of 80) and the router automatically translates the packet to port 8080 instead.\n\nThis could work in reverse as well. Where a non-standard port is used on the outside, but a standard port is used on the inside server.\n\nFor example, the standard port associated with SSH traffic is TCP/22. Malicious users routinely scan the entire IPv4 address space for servers listening on port TCP/22 to look for all SSH servers in hopes of finding some with weak passwords. A common strategy is to host SSH on a non-standard port in an effort to hide your SSH server from this mass scanning that occurs on port 22. https://www.practicalnetworking.net/series/nat/static-pat/"

In most companies, authorized AP are being controlled and setup to use some form of connection/login control and encryption for users to connect to the AP and access the network. A rogue AP are not setup to provide such controls and encryption and thus are a Security Risk. Rogue AP allows anyone to connect to the network thru the rogue AP and still able to obtain IP from the actual DHCP server, and (depending on any further security prevention) access to company information. Another security issue is Rogue AP may imitate actual company AP and obtain login credentials. Also, actual company users may access thru the rogue AP and transmit information wirelessly without encryption and thus allowing MITM attack to obtain informations."

As a centralized device in the network, the wireless LAN controller is usually located at the data center, to which all the wireless APs on the network are directly or indirectly connected.\n\nHow a Wireless LAN Controller Functions?\nThe wireless access controller takes the bandwidth produced coming from a router and stretches it to fit the network needs. Similar to an amplifier in a stereo system, the wireless controller allows devices from farther distances to connect. Besides, it enables the network administrators to check all the data related to the network and is able to detect rogue access points and recent traps generated by the access points.\n\nhttps://community.fs.com/blog/wireless-lan-controller-explained.html"

In other words, a honeypot is there to distract the attackers from valuable assets of the organization.\n\nHoneypot can be defined as a system that is attached to the network. It is set up to be a decoy. It lures the hackers and wastes their time as they try to gain unauthorized access to the network or systems of the organization."

SIEM solutions provide a holistic view of what is happening on a network in real-time and help IT teams to be more proactive in the fight against security threats.\n\nWhat is unique about SIEM solutions is that they combine Security Event Management (SEM) - which carries out analysis of event and log data in real-time to provide event correlation, threat monitoring an incident response - with Security Information Management (SIM) which retrieves and analyzes log data and generates a report. For the organization that wants complete visibility and control over what is happening on their network in real-time, SIEM solutions are critical."

DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bit streams of up to 24 telephone calls simultaneously. The T1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 Mbps. DOCSIS is the standard for a cable modem. DSL is a Digital Subscriber Line which has variable speeds from 256 Kbps and up.

Out of these options, the T1 is the BEST to ensure you can reliably provide 23 simultaneous phone connections."

Network address translation is the mechanism that handles all of the in and out data. It lets all your internal devices to share a single outward facing ip address that is assigned to your router, and conceals the internal ip addresses from view."

Both are forms of NAT, but consider the subnet masks: Company A: /26, /26 (64*2 = 128 IPs, 124 hosts), and /28 on the other (16 IPs, 14 hosts). The types of NAT are Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, and PAT: with with static (1 to 1) or dynamic (many to many pool) NAT, you're probably paying for multiple public IPs (expensive) per site. With PAT, you only need one public IP per site and map to the private addresses using ports instead of separate IPs. I mean technically, PAT is a form of NAT, but if they want the BEST answer, PAT seems best to me."

But I guess our BEST involves VLMS( Variable Length Subnet Masking) where we choose sufficient but not excessive subnet masking and following that logic- it should be /19.

The same goes for the connection to the router. One port is sharing an ethernet with the switch. But the Router has TWO ports, so the second port is on it's own segment (with the ISP presumably). therefore, the total number is 13. \n\nIt's also fairly well defined in the official CompTIA study guide chapters 3 and 4."

These combine in a spring-loaded twist, reminiscent of BNC connectors, and are noted for their reliability. ST connector is very popular in communication applications, such as LANs and CCTV systems.\n\nLC cables: latch and release into their jacks in a manner similar to Ethernet connectors. Smaller in form than SC connectors, their durability is not compromised, nor is cost increased. Instead of snapping or thermo forming the connector to the cable, it is glued. This makes it a popular connector for field use. LC connectors are used in private and public networks, and are gaining in popularity due to their small form factor (SFF) optical transmitter/receiver assembly"

A loopback is essentially a physical layer test (test the ability of an interface transmit data (Tx) and receive that data back to itself (Rx). Performing a loopback at the demarc and router checks both sides of that physical connection to see if the physical ports or maybe internal electronics are faulty). As far as cleaning the cables: this is just one of their nasty wording tricks: even if the cables are dirty, we don't care ... we'd care if the *connectors* were dirty, but the choice says cables, not connectors. Sigh... this is exam is going to destroy me."

Neither the patch panel in the IDF nor the wall jacks amplify/boost the signal, so that signal has basically attenuated throughout the trip between MDF &lt;--&gt; IDF &lt;--&gt; wall jack &lt;--&gt; table. IDF &lt;--&gt; wall jack may be in spec, but the total distance may not be. A switch re-transmits the signal (ie. resets the max distance). Placing a repeater between the switch and each wall jack would work, but you'd lose all the other benefits of having a switch. While a repeater may be a good option, a switch is more effective in this case since there are so many cables and repeaters usually only work for an individual cable. Switch has other benefits aside from boosting the signal, so it is a better option than putting repeaters all over the place behind walls."

Since we already used 9 bits for the host, we only have 32 - 9 = 23 bits or /23 for the Network or subnet but there are two /23 in the choices. Then go back to the question they need a Class 'B' between B &amp; D, D falls in the Class B category. So answer is D."

Not modifying a laptop in \"any way\" indicates that everything in exactly the same on the laptop as it was before.  Exam questions should not be misleading or open to interpretation.  They should be specific and factual.  This question is NOT factual.  It in fact it actually lies to you.  Don't get me wrong, the answer is still where I would start, but it doesn't indicate whether the statement came from.  If it came from the user, then yeah, you can assume that something could have accidentally changed on the laptop without them knowing.  If the statement came from compTIA and is strictly information about the situation in the question, then you are to assume the problem isn't with the laptop... because compTIA told you that themselves!

Many many reasons. \nTherefore we must look to part 2 for the possible answers and start eliminating. \nC or F are most likely to be consistent with APIPA. C is not the issue as there are no issue with available addresses in the scope.

A cold site will generally take more than a\nfew days to bring online.\n\n\u2022 A warm site is the same as a cold site, but adds computers\nloaded with software and functioning servers\u2014a complete\nhardware infrastructure. A warm site lacks current data and\nmay not have functioning Internet/network links. Bringing\nthis site up to speed may start with activating your network\nlinks, and it most certainly requires loading data from recent\nbackups. A warm site should only take a day or two to bring\nonline.\n\n\u2022 A hot site has everything a warm site does, but also includes\nvery recent backups. It might need just a little data restored\nfrom a backup to be current, but in many cases a hot site is a\ncomplete duplicate of the primary site.

A good example of this approach is a separate SAN or storage network. In all other situations, the effort of configuring jumbo frames everywhere on your network is not worth the marginal improvement, and has the potential of slowing down or breaking non-jumbo frame clients."

Since it is not conventionally possible to determine if or when a device is transmitting, collisions are inevitable. To counter this, a timer mechanism is in place to regulate transmissions and will back-off pre-emptively, actively avoiding as many collisions as it can.\nMultiprotocol Label Switching is incorrect; this relates to labelling switched traffic of different protocols and has no relevance to collision aversion.\nOpen Shortest Path First is incorrect; OSPF helps find the shortest path through a network for fast and efficient delivery of data and has no relevance to collision aversion."

I just did not bother to finish the actual question, the key aspect being: the MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HOSTS... \nAnswers A and B are IP addresses so we can get rid of them, not valid subnet masks.\nSince the values 10 and 35 are the only ones repeated in both IP addresses we have to assume that the subnet mask will start with two full octet values: 255.255. That rules out answer E.\nThe number values for each bit of the third octet would run as follows:\n128 192 224 240 248 252 254 255\n1        1      1      1     1     1     1      1 \na subnet mask of 255.255.248.0 leaves us with three bits for hosts (2046). \na subnet mask of 255.255.240.0 leaves us with 4 bits for possible host calculation (4094) and is the answer."

As the others have said, if she was using a Cat 5 cable, the cable would not support speeds over 100 Mbps, so how would she be seeing 1000 Mbps down in the first place? The technician apparently connected all the way into her router and confirmed the speeds, so it seems the issue is indeed somewhere within her network to the router, because it's good beyond that. But then I don't see how any of the options other than A. \n\nB: If that was the case, it could also not reach 1000 Mbps, since the switch doesn't support sensing more than 10/100\nC: Cat 5 would not support more than 100\nD: Cat 6 goes all the way up to 10 Gbps, so it would definitely not be a bottleneck\nE: It's possible? I figured since the technician connected all the way into her router, we could eliminate issues between the termination point and her router? This was the second one I chose\nF - Doesn't make much sense. If she can download at 1000 Mbps, why would it only be able to reach 100 Mbps transmission if there were any issues with the signal? \n\nI'd appreciate if anyone could chime in with their knowledge on this one."

This information is passed to a RADIUS server, which checks that the information is correct, and then authorizes access to the ISP system.

This is more indicative of a DHCP issue rather than an Evil Twin attack. An Evil Twin attack would typically result in the user being connected to a malicious network, not just having an incorrect IP address. Therefore, the most likely cause of the issue in this case is DHCP exhaustion, not an Evil Twin (A). In an evil twin attack, an attacker sets up a rogue wireless access point with a name and settings that mimic a legitimate corporate network. Users may inadvertently connect to this rogue access point, thinking it's the legitimate network, and the attacker can then intercept or manipulate their traffic. However, this attack doesn't directly involve the allocation of IP addresses."

Most of existing detection techniques assume that the attacker will use the same legitimate wireless network gateway to pass through victim\u2019s wireless data. These detection methods will fail if the attacker uses a different gateway, such as using his own broadband cellular connection through his own smartphone. In this paper, we present a new client-side detection method to detect such an ETA that uses a different gateway from the legitimate one. It relies on SSL/TCP connection to an arbitrary remote web server to avoid attacker\u2019s misleading message, and trying to detect the changing of gateway\u2019s public IP address by switching from one AP to another in the middle of the SSL/TCP connection. The detection method is on the client side which makes it more convenient for users to deploy and ensure their security. Index Terms\u2014Evil Twin Attack, Wi-Fi security, TCP, SSL."

Think of it this way auditors outside the company audit the company because they are not affiliated or beholding to employees of the company. No conflict of interest. Its this type of separation that keeps a check and balance of the system. If I want to get paid and I installed the controls \u2026 I may tell you they work or fudge the reports even if they don't.

Thus, the very next sub-step of step 1 is to, you guessed it, identify symptoms.  This can come in the form of more questions to the user or by investigating other avenues, but you're already gathering information by questioning the user in any capacity, no matter how little.\n\nAlso, small rant, and this is a pretty good place to do it.  What the hell even is a step like \"gathering information\" anyway?  If you proceed to step 3 and test your working theory of a problem, the entire purpose of the step is to gather information on whether you have the right grasp of the problem or not.  So when you do that are you in step 3?  Step 1?  Both?\n\nRealistically speaking you're ALWAYS gathering information throughout the entire troubleshooting process, so the idea of having a blanket generic step such as \"gather information\" is about as useful as saying that step 1 is to exist, because you can't solve problems if you don't exist!  Thanks CompTIA, any more wise words of wisdom?\n\nAnyway, end rant."

The pairs must be connected in accordance with either the T568A or T568B standard, although most installations use T568B.\n\nIn order to reduce the amount of crosstalk between adjacent pairs, each pair has a different number of twists per inch. Apart from that, it\u2019s essential to use good quality cable that complies with industry standards.\n\nAlthough not originally intended for 1Gb Ethernet, Cat 5 cable does usually perform well enough for 1 Gbps operation. Also note that some Cat 5 cables have only 4 wires (2 pairs).\n\nA better to use Cat 5e cable, which is specifically designed for high-speed Ethernet, or Cat 6 cable.  Careful attention must be paid to ensure there are no split pairs, that all connections are to specification, and that the cable is not kinked. It\u2019s also essential that the length of each patch cable doesn\u2019t exceed 100 meters (328 feet)."

It clearly says at the begining \"In the past, users brought personal laptops\", so you can't just not consider laptops with RJ45/ethernet connectors, even if there's some models that doesn't include them nowdays, on the real world, you can still attach a USB adapter and use it. So disabling switchports is a best practice and the only action that will make sense in this context. The same protocols, secure or not, that runs in a corporate device will also run in a personal device. So allowing only secure protocols, although a best practice as well, doesn't prevent users from attaching devices to the network. It might increase the difficulties to make it work, but they will still be able to use it."

If this switch is connecting to another switch (doesn't say) it needs a cross through cable. A and B are out cause never mentioned coaxial, Fiber being used.\n\nC is out for 2 reasons again assuming its a switch to switch connection. 1 straight through cable and 2 WHO IS USING CAT5!!!!\n\nD is a cross through cable back in the year 2000 as half the line wasn't being used anyway so no reason to swap pins 45 and 78.   So this would be a bad decision unless you are using a 10/100 switch as that would be the speed you are going at.  \nIf you see this question on your test the network + certification is useless or this is a fake test as again this was only true in 19XX."

A software loopback towards the router usually only loops the DSU functionality of a CSU/DSU. A hardware loopback is able to prove that the entire CSU/DSU is not at fault.\"\n\nCSU/DSU (Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit) Explainer:\n\"A CSU/DSU (channel service unit/data service unit) is a digital-interface device used to connect data terminal equipment (DTE), such as a router, to a digital circuit, such as a Digital Signal 1 (DS1) T1 line. The CSU/DSU implements two different functions. The channel service unit (CSU) is responsible for the connection to the telecommunication network, while the data service unit (DSU) is responsible for managing the interface with the DTE.\n\nA CSU/DSU is the equivalent of the modem for an entire LAN. The DCE, commonly a modem or CSU/DSU, is the device used to convert the user data from the DTE into a form acceptable to the WAN service provider transmission link.\""

This results in less network chatter.\n\nLet\u2019s assume we need to transfer 20 gigabytes (21,474,836,480 bytes) of data as quickly as possible. With a standard 1500 byte MTU that will take 14,316,558 packets, but with an MTU of 9000 we are sending 2,386,093 packets.

Another unclear aspect of the question is that we don't know how the phone was originally getting power...from the injector or the switch port?  Was the PoE injector introduced only as part of the test?  If the phone was not brought to the switch for the test and the phone was originally getting power from the switch port then bad switch port would be appropriate."

When a host fails to obtain an IPv4 address with DHCP, it resigns itself to its fate of being incommunicado, and assigns its interface an APIPA address.  You have surely witnessed (likely in a moment of exasperated troubleshooting!) a host with an IPv4 address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range (see RFC 3927).  Like IPv6 link-local addresses, these APIPA addresses are usable addresses for unicast communications within a single broadcast domain on the LAN."

While it\u2019s true that SPF isn\u2019t perfect, when you combine it with DKIM and DMARC, it can drastically improve your email security posture. Let\u2019s look at what strong SPF email policies can do.\n\n-Improve deliverability: When you secure your email server with SPF, attackers cannot use your domain to send spam. This helps keep your domain off global blacklists, thereby improving your mail servers overall deliverability.\n-Combat email spoofing: An SPF record helps prevent spoofing and phishing by verifying the IP address of the sender compared to the domain owner.\n-Improves domain reputation: Having SPF email policies in places gives your domain elevated reputation and shows other servers and blacklist sites that you\u2019re committed to email security. This drastically decreases the odds that your outbound emails get falsely flagged as spam, and helps improve your standing inside firewalls and other cybersecurity databases.\n\nhttps://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/what-is-spf/"

This means that next time you update the record, your change will take up to one hour to go into effect. To make subsequent changes happen even more quickly\u2014for example, if you think you might want to quickly revert a change\u2014you can set a shorter TTL, such as 300 seconds (5 minutes).

Logically, a network would definitely need to have a DHCP and DNS services in place, but in typical CompTia fashion, important information about the environment is left out.  After re-reading, I interpreted it as that a functioning network already exists and is asking what is needed specifically for the server itself to come online and be accessible.  While I would personally give a server a static IP, a reservation can be equally appropriate.  Where the question is focusing on what the server needs, I feel the given answer is correct."

Load balancing\n\nLoad balancing distributes network traffic across multiple paths, which can include different ISPs, to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, and minimize response time. It can also provide redundancy in case one of the paths fails.\n\nA. Fault tolerance is primarily concerned with ensuring system availability and reliability in the event of failures, but it does not specifically address distributing traffic for performance improvement.\nB. Quality of service (QoS) involves prioritizing certain types of traffic to ensure the performance of critical applications, but it does not inherently involve using multiple ISPs to increase performance.\nD. Port aggregation (or link aggregation) combines multiple network connections into a single logical link to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy, but it typically involves multiple connections to the same network rather than different ISPs."
