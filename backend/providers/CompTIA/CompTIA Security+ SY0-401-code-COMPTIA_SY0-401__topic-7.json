So answer (B) would be wrong. The question says that the problem lays with the REPLICATION time of the backups to the offsite location. So the initial backups have already been created and are now ready to be transmitted (replicated) to the offsite location.  If the array is a tape system then answer (C) would be best, as the \u201cserver storage\u201d is disks and contains the original data pre-backup \u2013 so the de-dup would execute much quicker \u2013 then the smaller de-duped data would be backed-up, and then take less time to transmit to the offsite location.  I ASSUME it's a tape storage array, so (C) is right."
