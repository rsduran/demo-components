Establishing baselines during the scheduling phase involves setting the schedule baseline, which includes freezing the schedule to reflect the agreed-upon plan against which actual progress will be measured.\n\nTherefore, even though establishing baselines is typically associated with the planning phase, it's also an essential activity during the scheduling phase to complete and formalize the project schedule before moving into execution and monitoring phases."

In this case, the impersonation of a tax agency official and the attempt to gain access to the project repository through a team member suggest this tactic.\n    Phishing: While phishing often involves emails, its goal is typically to lure the recipient into clicking malicious links or attachments to steal their credentials. Here, the focus is directly on gaining access through trust and impersonation, not a malicious link.\n    Spoofing: This involves forging data to make it appear authentic. While the email might involve spoofing the tax agency email address, it's the social engineering aspect of impersonation that's more prominent.\n    Hacking: This involves technical methods to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. While this scenario could involve a hacker trying to exploit human behavior, the social engineering aspect takes precedence here."

Implement the change: This would happen later in the process, after developing and testing the change, and only during the pre-determined maintenance window.\n    B. Approve the test plan: While approving the test plan is important, it typically precedes determining the maintenance window as the window depends on the test schedule and potential downtime impact.\n    C. Notify customers: Depending on the organization's policies and the impact of the change, customer notification might happen before or after developing the rollback plan, but it's not the immediate next step.\n    D. Develop a rollback plan: This is a crucial step after defining the maintenance window and before implementing the change. It ensures you have a clear strategy to revert to the previous state if any issues arise during the change, minimizing downtime and impact."

This option likely requires the most availability from the business team due to ongoing participation in sprint planning, backlog refinement, and daily scrum meetings.\nPRINCE2: This is a structured project management methodology with less emphasis on continuous business team involvement compared to Scrum.

Defining the project objectives, scope, and success criteria.\n\nDefining the project objectives, scope, and success criteria is the most important task during project planning. This is because it sets the foundation for the rest of the planning process. The project objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. The scope should define the boundaries of the project and what is included and excluded. The success criteria should define how the project will be measured to determine if it was successful."

By comparing the two lines, the Scrum master can identify any gaps, trends, or issues in the project delivery. Based on the image, the most likely update that the Scrum master can provide to the senior management team isD. The project is trending ahead of schedule. This is because the actual effort line is above the planned timeline line for most of the time, indicating that the project team is completing more features than expected in each sprint.

They provide a visual representation of the project's timeline and help identify which tasks can overlap and which ones are dependent on each other. By using a PERT chart, project managers can allocate resources more effectively, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and on time. While Gantt charts, milestone charts, and budget burndown charts are also valuable project management tools, they may not offer the same level of detail and insight into task overlaps as PERT charts do."
