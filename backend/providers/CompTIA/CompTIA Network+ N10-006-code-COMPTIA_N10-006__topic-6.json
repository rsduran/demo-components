Let's look at all the answers, in order for lab computers within the LAN to communicate, LAN-LAN traffic is necessary, so don't pick A, don't block LAN-LAN!  The Q doesn't mention WiFi, so D is not the best answer.  They want to block in-&gt;out traffic, from the LAN to the internet, in this case the WAN must be assumed to be the internet for any question to work.  Blocking in-&gt;out, or LAN to WAN, is the best answer, B.  You can block out-&gt;in if done correctly, but outgoing traffic would still traverse your internet pipe.  Why have extra traffic going OUT the internet if you are only going to block it coming back?  The BEST answer is block it before it leaves, keeping unnecessary WAN traffic off your internet connection.  Thus B is the BEST answer.  Don't memorize Qs.

Loopback not set - Would not effect link status, this is primarily used in BGP routing and has nothing to do with link state.\nC. Bad wire - Since network wires don't move, this would typically cause an interface's line protocol to go and stay down.\nD. Incorrect encapsulation - This would impact routing, not physical link state.\nE. Duplex mismatch - By process of elimination, this is the only remaining answer. A mismatch in duplex between both sides of the connection will cause the link to bounce repeatedly.\n\nAnother way to look at it is based on the question. The thing to note is that it is asking about a physical layer issue (Interface flapping), and only C and E are physical layer problems. We know it can't be C since it is extremely unlikely a bad wire will \"sometimes work\". That leaves E as our only choice."

As an example (or for starters) the onus lies with management responsible for hiring  to have a robust vetting system in place, which would already weed out (or put extra restrictions on) interviewees for the job vacancies that garner more questions than answers.\n\nSuch filters should eventually cascade to the network administrator who can implement the appropriate operational and technical controls set for the new hires BEFORE even having access to their terminals.  \n\nGranted that the topic discussed here is by far more granular in its complexity, but with every level of the hire process lending their weight on implementing a set of tried and tested policies, implementation could eventually be  streamlined - with periodic policy reviews in place - as we all know that an organisation seen from any angle (being the people that make the company to the underlying IT that allows the ultimate workings) is never static...\n\nSecurity Controls\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Information_Security_Basics/Security_Controls"

In very simple terms it encompasses protection services abiding to all 3 main areas (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication - Not to be confused with the CIA triad*).\n\nSHA is classified as a hash function. Simply put:\n\n'Hash functions are the building blocks for modern cryptography. A hash function is a cryptographic algorithm which is used to transform large random size data to small fixed size data.'\n\nHence, it provides integrity as the process is a 'one way street'. More can be read via link below.\n\nIn short, SHA would answer the question more accurately as it does one simple job: integrity, unlike IPSec, which as mentioned earlier is a suite that includes integrity.\n\nhttp://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=24833&amp;seqNum=3\n\nhttps://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/differences-between-hash-functions-symmetric-asymmetric-algorithms\n\n*\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cissp-for-dummies/9781118417102/a2_13_9781118362396-ch08.html"
