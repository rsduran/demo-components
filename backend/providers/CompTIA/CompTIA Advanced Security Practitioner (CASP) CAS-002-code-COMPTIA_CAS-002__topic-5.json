    "body": "Company A needs to export sensitive data from its financial system to company B\u2019s database, using company B\u2019s API in an automated manner. Company A\u2019s policy prohibits the use of any intermediary external systems to transfer or store its sensitive data, therefore the transfer must occur directly between company A\u2019s financial system and company B\u2019s destination server using the supplied API. Additionally, company A\u2019s legacy financial software does not support encryption, while company B\u2019s API supports encryption. Which of the following will provide end-to-end encryption for the data transfer while adhering to these requirements?<br>",
