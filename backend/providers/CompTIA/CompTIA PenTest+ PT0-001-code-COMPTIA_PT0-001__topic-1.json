It would be better to add to the registry, and in consequence, I don't see any intention from the n00b writting the D command to want to achieve persistence, it would more be information gathering.\nIf we follow the logic of \"correcting\" the answers, the C can be also a correct answer, by adding \"&amp;&amp; Sv.ps1\", altought this wouldn't work for multiple reasons.\nI would anwser A."

If you only run the powershell just once, it will no longer persist once the computer is restarted. That's why I believe the /run command eliminates answer A.

The report had a finding that the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) had a base score of 1.0. \nTo exploit this vulnerability, which level of difficulty would be required?\n\nA. Very difficult, because the perimeter systems are usually behind a firewall\nB. Somewhat difficult, because it would require powerful processing to exploit\nC. Trivial, because little effort would be required to exploit the findings\nD. Impossible, because the external hosts are hardened to protect against attacks\n\nThe CVSS score from every material found from this question on the Internet is 10.0 but from the book is 1.0.\n\nHere is their explanation:\n\nC. - The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry standard for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities. It provides a technique for scoring each vulnerability on a variety of measures. Security analysts often use CVSS ratings to prioritize response actions. Each measure is given a descriptive rating and a numeric score.\n\nIt must be just a typo but just a small detail I detected from this question."

He then stopped the service and rewrote the binary path loaded by the service to \"net localgroup administrators jason /add\", which will be run the next time the service is started.

All we need to Comptia giving us the choice of 'turn it off and back on'.....\nIf I get this Q my gut says C because I hope Comptia will see that some knowledge is being demonstrated related to the problem in the question"

As other people have said, parameterized or sanitized inputs would be an obvious choice and I\u2019m thinking the use of \u201cnormalization\u201d is a crafty CompTIA trick. Hardening an SQL database would necessitate parameterizing queries anyway so D seems to be a safe choice."

Any incompetent clown can speed read texts and link SOAP with XML...REST with JSON, etc etc ...but it takes a little better understanding to know the XSD aspects of SOAP XML and how that would square with how the app parses the data.

You the attacker send them an HTTP link, when they open it, it immediately uses HTTPS instead. There is no facility for the attacker to change the user's browser which has already stored the HSTS flag for that website. There is an edge case for a user that maybe hasn't logged into the site since the HSTS was enabled but if the basic auth cannot be changed in the web app, this is a good mitigation.

It is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser.\n\nSo, what can we do with a locked windows. Simply change the network connection, for example, connecting to a evil twin, therefore using a MITM attack. I'd say the key word on this question is 'laptop', which implies wifi connection. \nThen, I'd quick connect the laptop to an wifi AP I set up, and I'd discover the laptop MAC address. This is silly because I can sniff wifi traffic so I'd know the MAC address and I'd perform an ARP attack.\nB. Perform an ARP spoofing attack.\n\nSo, I'd go for D and the MITM theory.\nD. Conduct LLMNR/NETBIOS-ns poisoning.\n(anyways in a Active Directory environment, in theory, changing/managing wifi might be disabled by Group Policies)\n \nOnce more, this is not a 100% the right answer thanks to Comptia's brightest minds working together behind Pentest+ questions."

This just so happens to coincidently leave out question D as the odd one out making it my answer"

It provides a broad range of capabilities, including multiple scan modes intended to bypass firewalls and other network protection devices. Nmap is a port scanner. To scan for ports, you will want to use -p &lt;port ranges&gt; (only scan specified ports). This option specifies which ports you want to scan and overrides the default scan. Individual port numbers or ranges are acceptable. Ranges are separated by a hyphen (e.g., 1-1023). The beginning and/or end values of a range may be omitted, causing nmap to use 1 and 65535, respectively. So, you can specify -p- to scan ports from 1 through 65535. Port scanning a system simply requires that nmap be installed and that you provide the target system\u2019s hostname or IP address."

In this situation, port 22 is closed and port 23 is open to SSH which means that some application is running on that port. Telnet is a protocol that runs as a client-server application and typically used the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to establish a connection, it by default used port 23. Although the client has indicated that they've disabled Telnel but, the open port, 23 indicated that the Tenel services are running and the organization has not disabled Telnet.\n\nOther options cannot be true as:\n\n\u2192 Although the SSH service can run on other non-standard ports but, this range would be from port 1024 to 32767, hence port 23 cannot be in this range.\n\n\u2192 The NMap has stated that port 22 is closed, therefore port 22 cannot be filtered as if NMap is not able to get any response from a port it states it as filtered, and if a port is closed that means it is actually closed. Threfore, the port 22 cannot be filtered or port 23 as false positive."

Vendors refer to these threshold settings as false acceptance rates (FARs) and false rejection rates (FRRs)."

Thus, victims think they are talking directly to each other, but actually an attacker controls it. In this scenario, an attacker has been successful when it can impersonate a user. On the other hand, a third person between you and the person with whom you are communicating exists and he can control and monitor your traffic. Fortunately, some protocols can prevent it, like SSL. A hacker can use the below software to implement this attack:\nCain and Abel / Subterfuge / Ettercap / AirJack"

Advanced persistent threat (APT) is a computer network attack in which a person or group gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period of time. APTs provide the highest level of threat on the adversary tier list. Many of the techniques used by advanced persistent threat actors are useful for penetration testers, and vice versa. If your persistence techniques aren\u2019t monitored for or detected by the client\u2019s systems, the findings should include information that can help them design around this potential problem."

With blacklisting, specific, known malicious characters are removed from or replaced in user input. Although this approach is often implemented, largely due to the ease at which it can be accomplished, it is not effective when compared to whitelisting. Blacklisting can fail to properly handle complex obfuscation, which could allow an attacker to subvert filters and potentially inject SQL statements.

These could also identify potential certificate problems as well. Example: host1.foo.com resolves to 192.168.38.4 In the case of a load balancer, provide all expected IP resolutions of the FQDN. An attestation that hosts behind the load balance are in sync is also required. For a DR host, a statement should be provided that indicates the host is part of a backup or failover environment where the IP is needed to be used due to DNS not actively pointing to the host. A service provider may scan by IP if the web applications are out of scope and an attestation of such is provided in the dispute comments."

        "content": "however, most of the time it is best to run a credentialed scan against a target to get a full picture of the attack surface. An authenticated scan requires you to provide the scanner with a set of credentials that have root-level access to the system. The reason for this is that the scanner actually logs in to the target via SSH or some other mechanism. It then runs commands like netstat to gather information from inside the host. Many of the commands that the scanner runs require root-level access to be able to gather the correct information from the system.\n\nFigure 3-41 shows the netstat command run by a non-privileged user and then run again by a root user. You can see that the output is different for the different user-level permissions. Specifically, notice that when running as the user ron, the PID/Program name is not available, and when running as the user root, that information is displayed."

When implemented correctly this should also help with deliverability, thus reducing the changes of your email being flagged as spam.\n\n2FA would eliminate this attack vector, while 'Email system hardening' would reduce it.

This facilitates attackers' post-exploitation lateral mobility inside a network.

This allows consultants to view source code and be granted high-level privilege accounts to the network. The purpose of white-box testing is to identify potential weaknesses in various areas such as logical vulnerabilities, potential security exposures, security misconfigurations, poorly written development code, and lack-of-defensive measures. This type of assessment is more comprehensive, as both internal and external vulnerabilities are evaluated from a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d point of view that is not available to typical attackers.\n\nhttps://www.packetlabs.net/types-of-penetration-testing/"

A salt is a set of random data such as two additional characters. Password salting adds these additional characters to a password before hashing it. These additional characters add complexity to the password, and also result in a different hash than the system would create using the original password. This causes password attacks that compare hashes to fail."

Attestation of findings - Optional for the client and most likely asked for if the test was for compliance.\n3c. Lessons Learned - PenTest team meeting for after action reporting.\n\nWIth all that being A &amp; C are both huge security risks if left in place and should be eliminated since they both pose a potential risk. (D) is something that doesn't necessarily effect the pentest that was just preformed so this one is concentrating on the next test and future tests for the team.  Between B &amp; D I personally would go with B obtaining client acceptance.  Reason for this is the client is agreeing to the results and findings, signing that they are satisfied and the test was completed properly.  Many times attestation of findings are dismissed because the customer is satisfied with what has already been presented during testing and the report.  This is just my 2 cents though."

This handshake is executed when a client wants to join a protected Wi-Fi network, and is used to confirm that both the client and access point possess the correct credentials (e.g. the pre-shared password of the network). At the same time, the 4-way handshake also negotiates a fresh encryption key that will be used to encrypt all subsequent traffic. Currently, all modern protected Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake. This implies all these networks are affected by (some variant of) our attack. For instance, the attack works against personal and enterprise Wi-Fi networks, against the older WPA and the latest WPA2 standard, and even against networks that only use AES. All our attacks against WPA2 use a novel technique called a key reinstallation attack (KRACK):"
