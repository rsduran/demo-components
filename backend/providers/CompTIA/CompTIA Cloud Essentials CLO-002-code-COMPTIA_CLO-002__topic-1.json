Firewalls are designed to restrict connectivity to cloud resources by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.

Bursting.\n\nCloud Bursting is a strategy where a system is primarily run on-premises, but during peak demand (such as the holiday season), the overflow traffic is \u201cburst\u201d to the cloud. This allows the retailer to handle high loads without needing to permanently move all IT operations to the cloud. Bursting is ideal for situations where the workload is usually steady but occasionally experiences significant spikes, such as during holidays.\n\n\t\u2022\tElasticity and Scalability refer to general cloud concepts that allow resources to be dynamically adjusted to meet demand, but they imply more permanent cloud integration.\n\t\u2022\tSelf-service refers to the ability for users to provision resources on-demand, which is not specifically about handling peak loads.\n\nBursting directly addresses the requirement of handling high load during specific periods without a full commitment to the cloud."

The critical factor is \"...while ensuring these applications are only installed on company-controlled equipment\" -- this can only be assured if (1) app is accessible via virtual desktop link or (2) are virtualize apps (sessions) via VDI technology.  In either case, the user can customize her/his work environment, with exception of the specified business apps. In the case of VPN, the app is either accessible via either of two means: (1) VDI/Vapp or (2) is installed locally on the user's equipment.  First option leads us back to (B) VDI as correct answer; second violates premise of \"company-controlled equipment\", since the scenario provided does not indicate company-provided user equipment, and we cannot simply assume as much."

Penetration testing\n\nPenetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a cybersecurity assessment methodology where security experts simulate real-world attacks on a system to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. In the context of cloud infrastructure, penetration testing helps evaluate the security posture of the cloud environment, including networks, servers, applications, and configurations. By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities proactively, organizations can improve their overall security and mitigate potential risks."

It ensures that only parties possessing the private key can decrypt the encrypted data. By using private key encryption for all traffic in the new application, the developer aims to protect the confidentiality of the data being transmitted. This means that even if an unauthorized party intercepts the data, they won't be able to decipher its contents without the private key."

Lift and shift\n\nLift and shift involves migrating applications and data from on-premises or existing infrastructure to the cloud with minimal changes to the application architecture. This method is often preferred for disaster recovery scenarios because it allows organizations to quickly replicate their existing infrastructure and applications in the cloud without the need for significant reconfiguration or redesign. By lifting and shifting their infrastructure to the cloud, organizations can establish a redundant environment that can be readily activated in the event of a disaster, providing continuity of operations and minimizing downtime."

From the given options, the analyst should include the following three:\n\nB. Backups: Regular backups of critical data and systems are essential for disaster recovery. This ensures that in the event of data loss or system failure, the business can restore operations from a known good state.\n\nD. Replication: Replicating data and systems across multiple locations or servers helps ensure redundancy and availability. In the event of a disaster affecting one location, the replicated data or systems can be used to continue operations from another location.\n\nG. Geo-redundancy: Geo-redundancy involves replicating data and systems across geographically dispersed locations. This adds an extra layer of protection by ensuring that even if an entire region experiences a disaster, operations can continue from another unaffected location."

Breaches often lead to investigations to assess the extent of the violation and identify areas where compliance measures may have been lacking or insufficient. While vulnerabilities, risks, and threats are also important factors in assessing compliance, they may not necessarily trigger an audit on their own unless they result in a breach or are identified as significant issues during routine compliance checks."
