The majority of the application load takes place on the application server under normal conditions. For this reason, the company decides to deploy additional application servers into a commercial cloud provider using the on-premises orchestration engine that installs and configures common software and network configurations. The remote computing environment is connected to the on-premises datacenter via a site-to-site IPSec tunnel. The external DNS provider has been configured to use weighted round-robin routing to load balance connections from the Internet.<br>During testing, the company discovers that only 20% of connections completed successfully.<br>Review the network architecture and supporting documents and fulfill these requirements:<br>Part 1:<br>1. Analyze the configuration of the following components: DNS, Firewall1, Firewall2, Router1, Rouler2, VPN and Orchestrator Server.<br>2. Identify the problematic device(s).<br>Part 2:<br>3.

The questions says \"A company is interested in DRP\"... Site mirroring typically is copying the site to a different geographical area. DR is such a broad term because it can mean fixing a server in your cluster on location or it can mean moving the entire IT operations to a hot site location. So the question is absolutely terrible as it gives zero specifics about what incident they are concerned about. In my opinion, if it involves moving to another site then site mirroring is the answer but if it's an issue located inside the on-site data center, then active/active can be the correct answer.

Horizontal scaling requires changes that results in downtime which vertical scaling doesnot. \nVertical scaling can essentially resize your server with no change to your code. It is the ability to increase the capacity of existing hardware or software by adding resources. Vertical scaling is limited by the fact that you can only get as big as the size of the server.\n\nHorizontal scaling affords the ability to scale wider to deal with traffic. It is the ability to connect multiple hardware or software entities, such as servers, so that they work as a single logical unit. This kind of scale cannot be implemented at a moment\u2019s notice.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2014/04/09/explain-vertical-horizontal-scaling-cloud/"

This is important, because the chassis must continue to correctly forward traffic while it performs the software version upgrade. This necessarily involves a period in which two different software versions are in operation simultaneously.\n\nWith ISSU, you can upgrade the chassis to a future maintenance release - which may contain new functionality, or resolve a software issue - without disrupting network operation.\n question says in least downtime rolling update can be used"

A role could be a nurse, a backup administrator, a help desk technician, etc. Subjects are grouped into roles and each defined role has access permissions based upon the role, not the individual.\n\nDiscretionary Access Controls (DAC)\nDiscretionary Access Control (DAC) gives subjects full control of objects they have created or been given access to, including sharing the objects with other subjects. Subjects are empowered and control their data. Standard UNIX and Windows operating systems use DAC for file systems: subjects can grant other subjects access to their files, change their attributes, alter them, or delete them.\nIf a subject makes a mistake, such as attaching the wrong file to an email sent to a public mailing list, loss of confidentiality can result. Mistakes and malicious acts can also lead to a loss of integrity or availability of data."

Tokens are identifiers that can be mapped to sensitive data. The token is just an identifier and cannot be used to create the data without interfacing with the tokenization system.\n\nA system storing data on a cloud might store public data and then store a token in place of each sensitive data element, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI). The PII or PHI would be stored in the tokenization system, and the public cloud storage would retain the token for that information. When retrieving the data, the system would retrieve public data directly from the cloud storage, but would need to query the tokenization system to pull out the sensitive data, a process known as de-tokenization."

In the cloud, orchestration is often key to ensuring that automated spin-up activities like auto-scaling take place in the right order, with the right security rules and permissions in place."

Instead, these additional alerts, or secondary alerts, are grouped under the root alert called the primary alert. You can see these grouped alerts in the alert list in Alert Intelligence.\n\n    A primary alert identifies the root cause of an event.\n    A secondary alert is another alert that the same event generates, but is considered less important than the primary alert.\n\nI think the answer could be A or B"
