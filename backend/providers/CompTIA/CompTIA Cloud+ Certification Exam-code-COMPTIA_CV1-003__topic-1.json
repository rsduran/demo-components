For this reason, the company decides to deploy additional application servers into a commercial cloud provider using the on-premises orchestration engine that installs and configures common software and network configurations.<br>The remote computing environment is connected to the on-premises datacenter via a site-to-site IPSec tunnel. The external DNS provider has been configured to use weighted round-robin routing to load balance connections from the Internet.<br>During testing, the company discovers that only 20% of connections completed successfully.<br><br>INSTRUCTIONS -<br>Review the network architecture and supporting documents and fulfill these requirements:<br>Part 1:<br>\u2711 Analyze the configuration of the following components: DNS, Firewall 1, Firewall 2, Router 1, Router 2, VPN and Orchestrator Server.<br>\u2711 Identify the problematic device(s).<br>Part 2:<br>\u2711 Identify the correct options to provide adequate configuration for hybrid cloud architecture.<br>If at any time you would like to bring back the initial state of the simulation, please click the Reset All button.<br>Part 1:<br><br>Cloud Hybrid Network Diagram -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0000300001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0000400001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0000500001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0000600001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0000700001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0000800001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0000900001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0001000001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Part 2:<br>Only select a maximum of TWO options from the multiple choice question<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03625/0001100001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>",
