This would require an insider.\n\nIf a tester could social engineer his/her way into an office, that would tell you nothing, except that it could be done.

How do you prevent access if a cert is stolen and an ID spoofed? Are you issuing a new cert every week? Every month? A&amp;C are single-use ephemeral access solutions that use customer-provided contact information to ensure account security. It's neither practical nor plausible to run a certificate tree and start issuing out a million certs to a million customers."

This is another stellar example of a hopelessly ambiguous - and therefore unfair - CompTIA question. \nI am going to guess risk mitigation.\nThe reason the risk is lessened is because the policies and procedures have been changed. Not because a third party is doing the background check. If the company gave the task to the third party with the old policies and procedures the risk would be that same. Arguably, the risk is not being transferred to the third party, because the third party can claim \"we just followed *your* policies and procedures.\" In this case, the third party is not an insurer, just somebody else to implement the policies and procedures. \nSo that is what I am going with.

You've just gone to all the effort to get out of the data center because your reliability was bad, so the solution is to pull part of your services back into the data center you just moved out of? No way. It just doesn't make any rational sense.\nOf all the bad answers here, multicloud makes the most sense."

The firewall and IDS between the LAN and the Systems themselves would help protect from insider attacks I would think.\n\nI don't think you can set up your own stratum 0. I think they have to be atomic clocks\nLook at this reference wikipedia:\nStratum 0\n    These are high-precision timekeeping devices such as atomic clocks, GPS or other radio clocks. They generate a very accurate pulse per second signal that triggers an interrupt and timestamp on a connected computer. Stratum 0 devices are also known as reference clocks. NTP servers cannot advertise themselves as stratum 0. A stratum field set to 0 in NTP packet indicates an unspecified stratum.[25] \n\nHere are some time servers from NIST:\nhttps://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi\nI believe NIST only runs stratum 1 time and not stratum 0. \n\nMaybe you can...

On a file-by-file basis, password cracking is utilized to gain access to digital evidence to which a judge has allowed access, when a particular file's permissions are restricted."

That, in my mind, isn't active protection. I am an SME for EDR at my company and I wouldn't use it for this case scenario, AV would've done a better job here, especially if you're using something modern like Windows Defender that allows a great level of granularity. \"D\" - well, that's obvious to all of us.

For DDoS protection, once an attack is detected, black holing can be used to drop all DDoS attack traffic at the edge of an Internet service provider (ISP) network, based on either the destination or source IP address.

The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers questions like \u201cWhere am I most vulnerable to attack?\u201d, \u201cWhat are the most relevant threats?\u201d, and \u201cWhat do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?\u201d.\"\n\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model"

Use the route protection offered by the ISP to accept only BGP routes from trusted hosts on the Internet, which will discard traffic from attacking hosts?\nThis is the only answer that mentions BGP. Considering that BGP was mentioned in the question, I suspect that CompTIA is looking for that in the answer. Also, notice that answer A will also discard traffic from attacking hosts.\nThat said, it could be a red herring. \nI am not sure if there is enough information given to confidently chose any of the options. \nFor example, with answer 'A', is it acceptable to only accept traffic from known trusted hosts? Can the server do it's job without accepting traffic from unknown hosts? \nAs to the supposedly correct answer: C. Advertise a /32 route to the ISP to initiate a remotely triggered black hole, which will discard traffic destined to the problem server at the upstream provider. \nWill this discard all traffic to the problem server? Or will it only discard traffic from one particular server? Either way the answer does not seem to make sense. If we know the one host sending problem traffic, just block that host. If we want to stop all traffic, just disconnect the problem host."

Then, the filter can calculate a spam probability score against each new message entering your inbox.\n\nThis \u201clearning\u201d process also happens on the fly. For example, every time you instruct the filter to spam or quarantine certain messages, it will incorporate that data into future actions.\n\nSo, the Bayesian filter will improve with time \u2013 even as spammers invent new ways to get their emails through."
