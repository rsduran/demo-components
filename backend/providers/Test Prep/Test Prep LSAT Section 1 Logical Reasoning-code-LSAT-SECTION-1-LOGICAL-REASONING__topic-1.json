    "answerDescription": "Put G in three and try placing the rest of the awards. Begin with F and H, which must stay together (Rule 4). They cant go in four and five, because that wouldnt leave enough room for J to follow the K/L pair. So, F and H must be in the first and second spaces, in either order. Theres nothing more for us to deduce, so lets start checking for the choice that could be true.<br>The earliest that the Japanese award could be presented is<br>- third<br>- fourth<br>- fifth<br>- sixth<br>- seventh<br>What do we know about the placement of J? It must come after F, H, L, and K. So, with four awards before it, the earliest that J can be presented is fifth. Mark choice B. and move on.",
