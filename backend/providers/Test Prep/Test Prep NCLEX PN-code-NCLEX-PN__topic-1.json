Perimenopause lasts approximately five years. Climacteric is a term applied to the period of life in which physiologic changes occur and result in cessation of a womans reproductive ability and lessened sexual activity in males.

Postmenopause refers to the period after the changes accompanying menopause are complete. Health Promotion and Maintenance",
