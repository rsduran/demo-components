    "answer": "D",
    "answerDescription": "Brandon does not directly address the issue of whether or not animals have rights. Instead, he brings in another issue  whether or not animals would kill him if they were hungry for food  and thus shifts the argument to his pain rather than the right of animals to be free of pain. Thus, the best criticism of this argument is that Brandon brings in a red herring. Brandons response is not based on any assumption about human beings right to kill animals, so choice a is incorrect. He does give one specific example (lions), so choice b is incorrect. He does not attack Arthur, so choice c is incorrect. Finally, he does not make an absolute statement including all animals, so choice d is also incorrect.",
