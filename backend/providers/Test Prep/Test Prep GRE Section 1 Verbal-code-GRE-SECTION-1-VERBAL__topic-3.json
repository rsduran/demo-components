The second sentence discusses a classic, or model, example of the phenomenon described in the first sentence. The word paradigmatic means<br>\"classic or model,\" so it\u2019s perfect for blank (ii). The passage\u2019s final phrase provides the key to filling in blank (iii). What someone might struggle to solve is a problem or puzzle, which is exactly what the word dilemma means.",

The idea of the passage as a whole is that the \"adage\" mentioned in the first sentence is historically indefensible. To support this idea, the author seeks to point out that it would be completely and obviously wrong  in other words, patently absurd to aver (assert) that Americas womens rights pioneers could possibly be critical of  or suspicious of  the idea that women deserve equal rights.",
