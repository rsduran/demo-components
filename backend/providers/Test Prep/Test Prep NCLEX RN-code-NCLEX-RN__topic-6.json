    "answer": "Explanation",
    "answerDescription": "(A) This action would further increase the clients blood sugar. (B) NPH insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin, with an average of 46 hours before onset of action. The client needs insulin that will act immediately. During a ketoacidotic state, the client is dehydrated, so any insulin administered SC will be poorly absorbed. (C) Regular insulin is the fastest acting-insulin; when given IV, it will immediately act to decrease blood sugar. Regular insulin is given to decrease blood glucose levels by promoting metabolism of glucose, inhibiting lipolysis and formation of ketone bodies. (D) This action would further increase the clients blood sugar.",
