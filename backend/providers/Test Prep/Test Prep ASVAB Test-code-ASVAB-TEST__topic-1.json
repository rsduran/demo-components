You're looking for the point where revenue is greater than the cost (revenue &gt; cost). The inequity is 0.30x &gt; 6000 + 18x. Subtracting 18x from both sides of the inequity results in 0.12x &gt; 6000.<br>Divide both sides by 0.12. The result is that x &gt; 50,000. The printing plant would have to print and sell 50,000 cards per month to make a profit.",
