Dense Carbon recently announced that the results of a mining survey in its South African diamond mines were in, which revealed substantial amounts of diamond reserves for the first time. It has offered to take a few industry analysts for a tour of the facilities and take stock of the situation first hand. During this tour, all expenses, including air-fare and basic accommodations, were provided for by Dense Carbon. Since the visit spanned a weekend, Dense Carbon also arranged for a Safari tour for all the analysts.<br>Cariella did not consider the safari to be an undue entertainment, given the fact that the analysts had to be in the middle of nowhere for 5 days. She was quite assiduous in her appraisal of the mining reserves and in the final analysis, the tour proved extremely valuable to her analysis. However, she did not reveal the fact about the Safari trip to her employer. Cariella has<br>I. violated Standard III (C) - Disclosure of Conflicts to Employer.<br>II. violated Standard IV (A.1) - Reasonable Basis and Representations.<br>III. violated Standard IV (A.3) - Independence and Objectivity.<br>IV. not violated the AIMR code of ethics.<br>",
