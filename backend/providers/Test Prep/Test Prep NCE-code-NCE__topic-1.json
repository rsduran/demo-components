    "answer": "A",
    "answerDescription": "Piaget saw moral judgment broken into two age brackets: below and above age ten. Those under age ten tended to judge wrong-doings by the amount of damage caused rather than the intention behind the act. Hence, even though the person in answer A had the best intentions, he broke more dishes and, therefore, is seen as more wrong. Since the person stealing only knocked over one cup, it is not viewed as bad as breaking five dishes.",
