(C) During the first trimester there should be only a modest weight gain of 24 lb. It is not uncommon for women to lose weight during the first trimester owing to nausea and/or vomiting.

But that term isn't well-defined. Research has found that these symptoms aren't related to ongoing illness caused by borrelia bacteria. Research also shows that continued use of antibiotics doesn't improve these symptoms.\n\nIf you have new health concerns or continuing health problems after Lyme disease, talk to your provider. Symptoms may be due to many potential causes. Your provider can help you figure out the cause of your symptoms and find the right treatment for you."
