Produce a promotional calendar as a free Christmas gift to current and prospective customers. This is the favored option by the Marketing Director, as it is expected to increase orders by at least 10% and improve staff morale. The benefits would last into a second year and the costs would be funded from the business marketing budget.\nE. Do nothing. This is the option of not initiating the project and continuing with the current situation. This option would result in no additional costs, but also no additional benefits. The order numbers would likely continue to decline, staff morale would remain poor and skilled staff would leave. This option would not address the problem statement or achieve the project objectives."
