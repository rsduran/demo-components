It is created during the Initiating a Project process and is a high-level plan for the whole project. It will show the major products of the project, when they will be delivered and the associated cost. It is a major control document for the Project Board. The Project Manager keeps the Project Plan up to date during the project.\nThe Stage Plan is used at the Management Level. It is created for each stage (e.g., for a period of 2 months), and is used by the Project Manager on a day-to-day basis. It is much more detailed than the Project Plan and just focuses on one stage.\nThe Team Plans are used at the Delivering Level. They are created and used by the Team Manager in the Managing Product Delivery process. The focus is to plan the work that is assigned to the Team Manager in Work Packages."

The Business Case outlines the reasons for undertaking the project, the expected benefits, costs, risks, and potential returns on investment.\n\nWhile the Business Case does provide important information about the overall financial aspects of the project, it does not specifically focus on estimating the cost of delivering the project. The cost estimation and budgeting activities are carried out in the Plans theme, which is specifically dedicated to planning and controlling the resources, time, and costs required to deliver the project's products and services.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is C.

The Business Case theme addresses the project's justification and its alignment with the organization's objectives."

This estimate is used to create the project budget, which is a key component of the overall project plan.\n\nOnce the cost estimate is completed, it is important to regularly monitor and control project costs throughout the project's life cycle. This ensures that the project remains on budget and that any cost overruns are identified and addressed as soon as possible.\n\nIn contrast, the Business Case theme focuses on justifying the investment in the project, considering the expected benefits, costs, and risks."

Plan : Provides a statement of how and when objectives are to be achieved, by showing the major products, activities and resources required for the scope of the plan.

With hierachy its shown to to have several products, each product having its \"sub products\" (for example to set up a conference you need a venue, attendees, speakers etc.), and each sub products have their own sub items. So in that way its hierarchical. But being hierarchical doesnt mean there a certain order of products that need to be done first.

Quality assurance is therefore independent of the project.\n\nProject assurance is the project board's responsibility to assure itself that the project is being conducted correctly. The project board members each have a specific area of focus for project assurance, namely business assurance for the executive, user assurance for the senior user(s) and supplier assurance for the senior supplier(s). Project assurance is therefore independent of the project manager but not independent of the project.\n\nSo D is the correct answer."

It is important for project managers to regularly review and update the project's business case to ensure that it remains aligned with the organization's objectives.

This ensures that the methodology remains relevant and effective in delivering successful project outcomes.\nBy incorporating tailoring, PRINCE2 provides a framework that can be customized to meet the unique management needs of any organization, making it a versatile and widely applicable project management methodology."

To ensure that project assurance responsibilities in the role descriptions are fulfilled\n\nA minimum requirement for the 'organization' theme in PRINCE2 is to ensure that project assurance responsibilities in the role descriptions are fulfilled. This theme focuses on defining the roles, responsibilities, and structure of the project organization, and part of this is ensuring that the designated individuals fulfill their defined responsibilities within the project. This helps maintain clear lines of accountability and ensures effective project governance."

This role will include providing supplier resources to the project and ensuring that proposals for designing and developing the products are feasible and realistic.\nIn many cases, the senior supplier also represents the interests of those who will provide the maintenance services for the specialist products after closure of the project (e.g. engineering maintenance and support). Exceptions to this do occur, however (e.g. when the maintenance services are provided by the customer organization, such as an internal IT department, or are outsourced to a different supplier)."
