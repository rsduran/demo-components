The Stage Plan for stage 2 could create some additional project time tolerance by allowing no time tolerance in Team Plans.\n\nThis is because the project time tolerance of +1 week / -2 weeks is a buffer for the entire project, not just for one stage. If the Stage Plan for stage 2 does not use any of this tolerance (i.e., it is planned to be completed on time), then the remaining project time tolerance could be used for other stages or unforeseen delays. This would effectively create additional project time tolerance."
