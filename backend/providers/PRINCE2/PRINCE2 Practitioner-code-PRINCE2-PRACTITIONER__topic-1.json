The Executive ensures the desired outcome is specified by authorizing project startup, but is not directly responsible for specifying the outcome itself. Assessing and updating the Business Case is a Project Board duty. The Project Manager is responsible for the Benefits Review Plan during the project, while the Executive handles it post-project.\n\nSo in summary, the Executive's unique responsibility listed in the options is oversight of the Benefits Review Plan after the project finishes."

The project will deliver \u201ccapability to provide health and safety training\u201d, including the materials needed for classroom-based training and e-learning. The expected benefits for construction companies include a reduction in lost days and legal costs due to accidents.<br>The e-learning course will be developed by a specialist external consultancy. The materials for classroom-based training will be delivered by ABC Company\u2019s development team. All course materials will be piloted before they are used. ABC Company will deliver training to its customers and also hopes to sell the course materials to other training companies as part of their operational business. ABC Company will use their own sales and marketing departments to promote the courses.<br>The legislation requires construction companies to comply with the new legislation within two years. The course materials and trainers have to be accredited by a government agency before courses can be delivered. ABC Company is planning to deliver pilot courses within five months of starting the project.<br>The ABC Company standard development model for new courses recommends the following stages:<br><img title=\"image56\" src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/prince2-practitioner/image1.png\"><br>End of the Project scenario.<br>Additional Information:<br>The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) founded the company five years ago.
