Raise an issue (off-specification).\n\nExplanation:\n\nAccording to the PRINCE2 project management methodology, an issue is any relevant event that has happened, was not planned, and requires management action. An off-specification is a type of issue that means something that should be provided by the project is not, or is not likely to be, provided. In this case, the service level agreement does not follow the MFH document standards, which is a requirement stated in the Quality Management Strategy. Therefore, this is an off-specification issue that needs to be raised and resolved. The other options are not appropriate because:\n\nD. No action required is not a valid option because it means ignoring the issue and continuing with the project as if nothing happened. This could lead to further problems and risks in the future, and damage the project\u2019s reputation and credibility."

Move entry 3 to the Roles and responsibilities section because this is a quality responsibility.\n\nAccording to the PRINCE2 approach to quality management, the Project Board is responsible for approving the Quality Management Strategy, not for implementing it. The implementation of the Quality Management Strategy is done by the Project Manager and the Project Assurance roles. Therefore, entry 3 should be moved to the Roles and responsibilities section to reflect this."

Entry 4 is relevant because it specifies the industry standards for the outsourced services. Entry 5 is also relevant because it specifies the MFH document standards for the project documentation. Entry C is not relevant because it is already covered by the Roles and responsibilities section, where it states that the DIT will check the employment contracts. Entry D is relevant because it specifies how the project will manage any changes to the baselined products, which is an important aspect of quality management. Therefore, entry D should be added to the Quality standards section."

The statement to delete is \"Delete entry 8 because the results of quality reviews are recorded in the Quality Register.\" This is because entry 8 mentions that approval records for products that require them will be stored in the quality database. However, this conflicts with the fact that the Quality Register will be maintained to record the planned quality events and the actual results from the quality activities, as mentioned in entry 6. Therefore, it would be appropriate to delete entry 8 to avoid duplication of effort and ensure that all relevant quality information is recorded in the Quality Register"
