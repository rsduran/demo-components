Yes, because the outcome to have the \u2018capability to provide health and safety training\u2019 is clear.\n\nIn the \u2018Starting up a Project\u2019 process of PRINCE2, the aim is to do the minimum necessary just to see if it is worthwhile doing the Initiation stage. The project mandate is usually the only document that exists when this process starts, and this is not enough information for the Project Board to make the decision to start the \u2018Initiating a Project\u2019 process. Therefore, the purpose of this process is to provide the Project Board with the necessary information to judge if the project is worthwhile.\n\nIn this case, even though it was unclear whether ABC Company would just create the course or deliver it as well, the project board did agree on the need to have the \u2018capability to provide health and safety training\u2019. This clear outcome aligns with the purpose of the \u2018Starting up a Project\u2019 process in PRINCE2, making it an appropriate application of this process"
