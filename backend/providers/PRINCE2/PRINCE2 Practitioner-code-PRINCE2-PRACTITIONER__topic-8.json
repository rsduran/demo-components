The Project Board can then decide on the necessary corrective actions or escalate the issue further if needed.\n\nOptions B (Project Manager) and D (Executive) are not correct because, while the Project Manager is responsible for day-to-day management and the Executive is a key member of the Project Board, it is the Project Board as a whole that needs to be informed and take action on tolerance breaches. Option C (Corporate or Programme Management) is also not the immediate next step unless the Project Board decides to escalate the issue further."

Controlling a Stage: This process involves managing and monitoring the day-to-day activities within a stage, not setting tolerances.\nC. Managing a Stage Boundary: This process is about reviewing the current stage and planning for the next stage, but the tolerances would already have been set during the initiation.\nD. Directing a Project: This process is about the Project Board providing overall direction and decision-making but not specifically about setting stage tolerances.\nThus, stage tolerances are established during the \"Initiating a Project\" process to provide clear guidelines for project execution and control."
