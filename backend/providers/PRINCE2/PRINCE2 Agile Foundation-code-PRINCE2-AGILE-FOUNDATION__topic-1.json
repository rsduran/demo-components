It typically includes items such as task boards or Kanban boards, which show the status of tasks, what work needs to be completed, and what work is in progress. The term \"information radiator\" emphasizes the idea that information is radiated or broadcasted to everyone in the vicinity, making it easy for team members to stay informed about the project's status.\n\nA. Work in progress limit: This term refers to a constraint in Kanban systems that limits the number of tasks that can be in progress at any one time.\nC. Highlight report: This is a report used in PRINCE2 to summarize the status of the project for senior management, but it is not a board displaying work to be completed.\nD. Glad! Sad! Mad!: This is a retrospective technique used in Agile to gather feedback from team members about what made them glad, sad, or mad during a sprint, and it does not refer to a board displaying work."

This clarity helps stakeholders understand the minimum scope of the project and sets expectations for what the initial product will deliver.\n\nA.

Typical reasons for inclusion of a staging area are regulatory compliance checking, integration testing or any other form of validation and verification process. The problem is that when an error is picked up and a change needs to be made, further work may have already taken place on the current state of the product, which would have been baselined at the point of delivery into the staging area.\""

These points are summarized in Table 3.4 for quick reference.\n\n1.All references to PRINCE2 refer to the edition created in 2017 (Managing Successful Projects with PRINCE2). This version is already enabled to work with agile; it just needs to be tailored to suit any given project. Configuring PRINCE2 in the most effective way for agile is a matter of where to put emphasis and where to add further levels of detailed guidance. Nothing needs to be removed or significantly changed, as this is achieved through blending agile into PRINCE2 and tuning PRINCE2 appropriately"

This approach is often used during sprint planning to help teams estimate the level of effort required for each requirement and ensure that they can realistically commit to completing the work within the sprint timeframe. Option A (Rationalism), option B (Trading), and option C (Visioning) are not commonly used estimation techniques in agile development."

Agile acknowledges that it is difficult, if not impossible, to fully understand a complex project at the beginning, and that new information and requirements may emerge as the project progresses.\n\nBy avoiding too much detail at the start, agile allows for more flexibility in responding to changes and new information that may emerge during the project. Agile methodologies typically involve breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable pieces, and delivering incremental value to the customer at each stage.

The Scrum master facilitates and coaches the Scrum process while removing impediments identified by the team working at the delivery level. It could be said that there is no equivalent role in PRINCE2. The team manager is the most obvious candidate, but in Scrum and in many agile belief systems the team does not need to be \u2018managed\u2019 per se; it needs to be \u2018led and coached\u2019. When using agile in a PRINCE2 environment there will need to be a team manager or equivalent who is accountable to the project manager for the delivery of a team\u2019s products, but this will need to be handled appropriately (see section 10.4.1)."
