Yes, because changes in corporate strategy may impact a project\u2019s justification.\n\nThe \u2018continued business justification\u2019 principle in PRINCE2 states that a project must make business sense at all times, with a clear return on investment. If at any point the project\u2019s justification is no longer valid, it should be stopped.\n\nIn this case, even though the project still has a positive return on investment as per the original business case, corporate management has revised its targets for return on investment. If the project is not expected to meet these new targets, it may no longer provide sufficient value to justify its costs. Therefore, deciding to stop the project is an appropriate application of the \u2018continued business justification\u2019 principle.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that such decisions should be made carefully, considering all relevant factors and potential impacts.
