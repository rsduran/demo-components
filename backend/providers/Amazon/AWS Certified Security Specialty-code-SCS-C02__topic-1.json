    "body": "A company's security engineer is designing an isolation procedure for Amazon EC2 instances as part of an incident response plan. The security engineer needs to isolate a target instance to block any traffic to and from the target instance, except for traffic from the company's forensics team. Each of the company's EC2 instances has its own dedicated security group. The EC2 instances are deployed in subnets of a VPC. A subnet can contain multiple instances.<br>The security engineer is testing the procedure for EC2 isolation and opens an SSH session to the target instance. The procedure starts to simulate access to the target instance by an attacker. The security engineer removes the existing security group rules and adds security group rules to give the forensics team access to the target instance on port 22.<br>After these changes, the security engineer notices that the SSH connection is still active and usable. When the security engineer runs a ping command to the public IP address of the target instance, the ping command is blocked.<br>What should the security engineer do to isolate the target instance?",

The solution will monitor for public access and for changes to any S3 bucket policy or setting that result in public access. The security team configures EventBridge to watch for specific API calls that are logged from AWS CloudTrail. EventBridge has an action to send an email notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to the security team immediately with details of the API call.<br><br>Specifically, the security team wants EventBridge to watch for the s3:PutObjectAcl, s3:DeleteBucketPolicy, and s3:PutBucketPolicy API invocation logs from CloudTrail. While developing the solution in a single account, the security team discovers that the s3:PutObjectAcl API call does not invoke an EventBridge event However, the s3:DeleteBucketPolicy API call and the s3:PutBucketPolicy API call do invoke an event.<br><br>The security team has enabled CloudTrail for AWS management events with a basic configuration in the AWS Region in which EventBridge is being tested. Verification of the EventBridge event pattern indicates that the pattern is set up correctly.

With VPC peering, all resources in the peered VPCs have the ability to communicate with each other directly.\n\nCloudFormation Fn::ImportValue: While using CloudFormation's Fn::ImportValue (Option A) is a common approach to share values between stacks, in this scenario, AWS RAM provides a more structured and scalable way to share resources (subnets) across accounts."

This might be more permissive than necessary and could introduce security risks if the policy is used elsewhere.\nB. Add Role to S3 Bucket Policy: While adding the EC2 instance profile role to the S3 bucket policy would allow access, it bypasses IAM role-based access control and couples the policy directly to the instance role. This approach is less flexible and doesn't leverage the benefits of IAM roles for managing access.\nD. Attach Policy with S3: Permissions:* Granting S3:* permissions through an inline policy would provide excessive access to the application. It's essential to follow the principle of least privilege and only grant the necessary kms:Decrypt permissions for the specific KMS key used for encryption."

However, it\u2019s important to note that this method might not be 100% effective if the fraudulent users are using VPNs or other methods to appear as though they are in France. Therefore, it\u2019s a good idea to also use the Lambda trigger for additional validation."

Same Subnet: Deploying S3 bucket and Lambda functions in the same subnet wouldn't require a special endpoint, but it's not a best practice.

It's a bucket policy, so it will only apply to this specific S3 bucket and won't affect Bob's permissions elsewhere.\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because:\nA: This policy allows access instead of denying it.\nC: This policy uses the wrong ARN format for a federated user.\nD: This policy targets an assumed role session, not a federated user directly."

By federating access to the game with third-party identity providers, players can log in using their existing social media credentials, eliminating the need for password resets and login assistance. This approach also ensures that each player's credentials are securely protected, as Cognito handles the authentication and authorization processes"
