The developer can use the DynamoDB table to query and retrieve employee details, while the S3 bucket can be used to store the high-resolution photos.

To use a certificate with Elastic Load Balancing for the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or set of FQDNs in more than one AWS region, you must request or import a certificate for each region. For certificates provided by ACM, this means you must revalidate each domain name in the certificate for each region. You cannot copy a certificate between regions.\n\nTo use an ACM certificate with Amazon CloudFront, you must request or import the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. ACM certificates in this region that are associated with a CloudFront distribution are distributed to all the geographic locations configured for that distribution."

You can define your serverless resources in a YAML template and then use the AWS SAM CLI to package and deploy your application.\n\nAWS CloudFormation serverless intrinsic functions can also be used to define serverless resources in YAML, but they have some limitations compared to AWS SAM. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) that is not serverless specific, while the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an alternative to YAML-based templates that uses familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, and Java to define AWS infrastructure."

When a new file is added to the S3 bucket, the S3 event notification will trigger the Lambda function, which will insert the record into the DynamoDB table.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Amazon EventBridge is not necessary to achieve this. S3 event notifications can directly invoke a Lambda function to insert records into DynamoDB.\n\nOption C is incorrect because polling the S3 bucket periodically to check for new files is inefficient and not necessary with S3 event notifications.\n\nOption D is incorrect because running a cron job at a scheduled time is not real-time and would not insert the record into DynamoDB as soon as a new file is added to the S3 bucket."

Set up a cron job on an Amazon EC2 instance. Run a script every hour to query the table for changes and process the documents: This approach introduces additional complexity and is not near-real time. Running a script periodically to check for updates is inefficient and does not meet the requirement for immediate processing upon document addition or update.\n\nB. Enable a DynamoDB stream on the table. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to process the documents: This is the most efficient and least intrusive option. DynamoDB Streams capture changes to items in the DynamoDB table as they occur in near-real time and can trigger an AWS Lambda function automatically. This setup requires minimal changes to the existing application code, as the processing logic is moved to the Lambda function, which is triggered by the stream events."

With the in-place deployment configuration, all traffic is shifted to the updated versions of the Lambda functions immediately after deployment.\n\nOption B suggests a linear deployment configuration that shifts 10% of the traffic every minute. While this provides controlled deployment and gradual rollout, it might not be the fastest approach if you want to minimize deployment time.\n\nOption C suggests an all-at-once deployment configuration.

AWS Step Functions can orchestrate the Lambda function invocations and manage the workflow, including handling API call rate limits. The Wait state can be used to introduce delays between API calls to ensure compliance with the rate limits. This approach also allows for handling errors and retries effectively.\n\nB. Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to hold the API calls. Configure the Lambda function to poll the queue within the API threshold limits: While using SQS to queue API call requests is a good way to manage workload, it adds complexity to the solution. The Lambda function would need to be modified to manage the queue and ensure API calls are made within the threshold limits. This approach might not be as straightforward and efficient as using Step Functions."

It essentially sends the request to a queue for asynchronous execution and doesn't wait for the processing to complete before providing a response.\n\nIn contrast, option D suggests using the X-Amz-Target header with a static value of 'Async,' which is a more appropriate choice when you need to provide an immediate response to the client while offloading the processing for background execution. This approach better aligns with the requirement of displaying a message to the user while the files are being processed, which is typically achieved through asynchronous processing with notification upon completion."

Modify the application to use the AWS SDKs for DynamoDB: The AWS SDKs implement best practices, including automatic retry logic with exponential backoff. Using an AWS SDK for DynamoDB can simplify the implementation and is more efficient than directly calling the DynamoDB REST API. This change can help mitigate throughput exceedance errors."

However, in this scenario, the issue is related to metrics (order quantity), and using CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms is a more suitable approach.\n\nI'd go with option D. It seems like a more direct and efficient approach. By using custom CloudWatch metrics for the DynamoDB stream, you can specifically track the relevant data without the need for additional CloudWatch Logs Insights queries. The alarm will then allow you to easily visualize and monitor the number of unique customers affected by the issue each day on the CloudWatch dashboard."

Customers send the ticket requests to an Amazon API Gateway API with an AWS Lambda function that acknowledges the order and generates an order ID. The application includes two additional Lambda functions: one for inventory management and one for payment processing. These two Lambda functions run in parallel and write the order to an Amazon Dynamo DB table.<br><br>The application must provide seats to customers according to the following requirements. If a seat is accidently sold more than once, the first order that the application received must get the seat. In these cases, the application must process the payment for only the first order. However, if the first order is rejected during payment processing, the second order must get the seat. In these cases, the application must process the payment for the second order.<br><br>Which solution will meet these requirements?",

This is critical for maintaining the order of ticket requests.\n\nSQS FIFO Queues: By having two separate FIFO queues for inventory management and payment processing, the application can process these aspects in parallel while still maintaining the order integrity. The FIFO nature of the queues ensures that if a seat is sold more than once, the first order received is processed first.\n\nOrder Processing Logic: With this setup, if the first order is rejected during payment processing, the second order can be processed next. The sequential processing inherent in FIFO queues ensures that this logic can be correctly implemented."

This option isn't available.\n\nThe next best option would be Option B. Better than A, since you won't be charged for an order where seating isn't available.\n\nIf I am wrong, please explain it.

Increasing the provisioned read capacity units (RCUs) and/or write capacity units (WCUs) for the DynamoDB table will allow it to handle a higher request rate, thereby reducing the likelihood of encountering this error. However, this approach requires careful capacity planning and may increase costs.\n\nC. Exponential backoff is a standard error retry strategy that involves progressively increasing the delay between retries when there is a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. This approach helps to smooth out the rate of requests, giving the table time to accommodate bursts of read or write requests. Implementing exponential backoff in the application will help to effectively manage request retries and reduce the chance of continually hitting the provisioned throughput limit."

Within the API Gateway, you can create multiple stages, each corresponding to a different environment (development, test, production). Similarly, for the Lambda function, you can create multiple aliases, each pointing to a different version of the Lambda function that corresponds to each environment. This setup allows for clear separation of environments within the same set of resources. It simplifies deployment and management by reducing the number of resources and also provides an easy way to promote changes from one environment to another."

This caching is designed to improve performance by reducing the number of calls to the Lambda function. However, it can also lead to outdated authorization information being used if the user's attributes change in the identity provider (IdP) but the cached policy in the Lambda authorizer is still based on the old attributes.\n\nIn this case, when the developer initially logged in with the department set to Engineering, the custom Lambda authorizer created and cached a policy based on this information. Subsequently, even after the developer updated their department to Sales in the IdP, the cached policy (which still reflects the Engineering department) was used, leading to the access denial."

The EC2 instances will have temporary security credentials provided by the role, and the permissions granted to the role can be tightly controlled using IAM policies. This approach eliminates the need to manage and store long-term access keys on the EC2 instances, which can be a security risk.\n\nC. Using the S3 GeneratePresignedUrl API call allows the application to generate time-limited URLs that provide temporary access to objects in the S3 bucket. These pre-signed URLs can be generated for authenticated users, ensuring that only authorized users can access the objects. This approach ensures that the objects in the S3 bucket remain private and are not publicly accessible."

This eliminates the need to package the library with each Lambda function, which would not be feasible given the size constraints of Lambda layers and deployment packages.

This strategy involves creating a second user in the database with the same permissions as the original user. During rotation, Secrets Manager switches between these two users, updating the credentials for the inactive user and then making it the active user for subsequent connections. This approach minimizes the risk of downtime because the application can continue to use the currently active credentials while the other set is being rotated. It also ensures that credentials are regularly updated, enhancing security without disrupting database access."

We can define a subset of users i.e. 10% for a set period of time. After this the other users will be impacted as the percentage will increment or the deployment will push new code to 100% of users.\n\nWith a weighted alias we can define a subset of users and use this as our guinea pigs to test new code. As this isn't a canary deployment we have no risk of more users becoming impacted. Operational overhead is minimal as we only need to point to a new alias.\n\nWith weighted alias we can deploy for testing purposes. From my understanding lambda proxy is grouping lambda functions. the traffic splitting would need to be set at the lambda level as this is testing prior to deployment."

As we already have reports of performance issues here I think the more long winded canary option is less feasible. \nthe canary checks for broken links and compares screenshots to baseline images, it also checks for heart beats and whether API's read/write functionality is working.\nI feel like Xray would be the better tool as the SDK with provide higher quality metrics and highlight latency, bottlenecks or other performance issues at any point in the service map. It is a single tool as opposed to option D's needing two tools and ultimately if option D requires X-ray to add granularity to canary results why not just start with X-ray."

This ensures that the system resources are conserved for more critical user interactions and transactions.\n\nHigher Sampling Rate for User Interactions: By sampling at a higher rate for requests that handle user interactions or transactions, you can ensure that these important requests are traced more comprehensively. This allows for better monitoring and troubleshooting of the application where it matters most.\n\nSelective Tracing: This approach allows you to selectively trace and monitor requests based on their importance and volume. High-volume background tasks are sampled minimally or not at all, while low-volume but critical user interactions and transactions are sampled more frequently."
