Once you lock the policy, you can no longer change it. However, before the policy is locked, you can call the abort-vault-lock operation to stop the lock process, correct your policy, and then start the initiate-vault-lock operation again.

When you change KMS keys, you need to update references to the KMS key ID or ARN in your applications. Aliases, which associate a friendly name with a KMS key, make this process easier. Use an alias to refer to a KMS key in your applications. Then, when you want to change the KMS key that the application uses, change the target KMS key of the alias.

Additionally, by copying the report to Amazon S3, the incident response team will have a secure and durable storage location for the audit logs and it's important to note that AWS Config and CloudTrail logs can also be used to view changes in IAM policies, but the Credential Report provides a more detailed and user-centric view of IAM permissions, which can be useful in incident investigations."

AWS KMS automatically keeps previous versions of keys to use for decryption of data encrypted under an old version of a key. All new encryption requests against a key in AWS KMS are encrypted under the newest version of the key.\n\nIf you manually rotate your imported or custom key store keys, you may have to re-encrypt your data depending on whether you decide to keep old versions of keys available."

You don't need to remember or schedule the update.\nHowever, automatic key rotation has no effect on the data that the CMK protects. It does not rotate the data keys that the CMK generated or re-encrypt any data protected by the CMK, and it will not mitigate the effect of a compromised data key.\n\nYou might decide to create a new CMK and use it in place of the original CMK. This has the same effect as rotating the key material in an existing CMK, so it's often thought of as manually rotating the key. Manual rotation is a good choice when you want to control the key rotation schedule. It also provides a way to rotate CMKs with imported key material."

However, you can use them in combination with a CMK's key policy if the key policy enables it. Giving the AWS account full access to the CMK does this; it enables you to use IAM policies to give IAM users and roles in the account access to the CMK. It does not by itself give any IAM users or roles access to the CMK, but it enables you to use IAM policies to do so. For more information, see Managing access to AWS KMS CMKs.\n\nThe following example shows the policy statement that allows access to the AWS account and thereby enables IAM policies.\n\n{\n  \"Sid\": \"Enable IAM User Permissions\",\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"Principal\": {\"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root\"},\n  \"Action\": \"kms:*\",\n  \"Resource\": \"*\"\n}"

It is not the root user.\nWhat this is actually doing is delegating permission to IAM. And in fact this statement here is delegating all KMS actions to IAM.\nSo that means any IAM user or principal within the account (so if you have another IAM user a role that also has a KMS star policy) to this key they are full admin. They will be able to perform any option that they want against this key.\nSo don't confuse that 'root' in this statement for the root user, but we only think of this statement as allowing IEM to further delegate permission.\""

You can then specify metrics to search the logs for any specific values. And then create alarms based on these metrics. Option A is invalid because this will be just a long over drawn process to achieve this requirement Option C is invalid because AWS Inspector cannot be used to monitor for security related messages. Option D is invalid because files cannot be exported to AWS Cloudtrail For more information on Cloudwatch logs agent, please visit the below URL https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/QuickStartEC2Instance.html"

However, you can use them in combination with a CMK's key policy if the key policy enables it. Giving the AWS account full access to the CMK does this; it enables you to use IAM policies to give IAM users and roles in the account access to the CMK. It does not by itself give any IAM users or roles access to the CMK, but it enables you to use IAM policies to do so. For more information, see Managing access to AWS KMS CMKs.\n\nThe following example shows the policy statement that allows access to the AWS account and thereby enables IAM policies.\n\n{\n  \"Sid\": \"Enable IAM User Permissions\",\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"Principal\": {\"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root\"},\n  \"Action\": \"kms:*\",\n  \"Resource\": \"*\"\n}"

It can also perform complex analysis on the logs, such as anomaly detection, and provide powerful search capabilities. Additionally, it can be used to visualize the log data through Kibana, which can help with troubleshooting and identifying patterns in the data. The ability to replay events is not provided by Elasticsearch but it can be used as a part of a solution that allows that by indexing the logs with a timestamp and then using it to query the logs at a specific point in time. Finally, the data stored in Elasticsearch is persisted, and the service can be configured with automatic data snapshots, which can be used to recover data in case of data loss."

For example, if you have a web application that uses an ELB and a number of Amazon EC2 instances, you might decide to create one security group for the ELB (ELB security group) and one for the instances (web application server security group). You can then create an allow rule to permit internet traffic to the ELB security group, and another rule to permit traffic from the ELB security group to the web application server security group.

However, managing individual key policies for hundreds of CMKs can be complex and time-consuming. Instead, you can use IAM policies to manage access to CMKs by creating an IAM role that has permission to use KMS and attaching an IAM policy to that role.\n\nTo simplify the process of managing access to CMKs, you can create an IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions to the IAM role, and then attach that policy to the KMS key administrator's IAM user or role. This way, all newly created CMKs will automatically inherit the same permissions as the KMS key administrator."

Here is the fundamental knowledge needed: If a compute actor is trying to retrieve an encrypted key from SSM, does that Compute actor need the permission to access (specifically decrypt) the CMK, or does SSM need it? Answer is: the compute actor. KMS key policy provide does provide an alternative to this, which is the \"ViaService\" condition. But if we are using ViaService, then ssm.amazonaws.com will be specified not as the Principal, but as the ViaService. Hence, the correct answer is C, not A."

They can then use the key-value pairs to make their own CSR and ultimately receive their own certificate.\n\nMore specifically, the container would complete the following steps at runtime:\n\nAdd OpenSSL to the Docker image (if it is not already included).\nGenerate a key-value pair (a cryptographically related private and public key).\nUse that private key to make a CSR.\nCall the ACM Private CA API or CLI issue-certificate operation, which issues a certificate based on the CSR.\nCall the ACM Private CA API or CLI get-certificate operation, which returns an issued certificate."

The load balancer uses a server certificate to terminate the front-end connection and then to decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the targets. Note that if you need to pass encrypted traffic to the targets without the load balancer decrypting it, create a TCP listener on port 443 instead of creating a TLS listener. The load balancer passes the request to the target as is, without decrypting it.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html"

NLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and allows for direct forwarding of traffic to the instances without terminating the SSL/TLS connection at the load balancer. This means that the SSL/TLS encryption and decryption are handled by the application servers themselves, reducing the exposure of the external certificate. By using this approach, the SSL/TLS encryption remains intact between the client and the application servers, protecting the data in transit."

If you ask the 2nd q, you will see that doing this will make it impossible to actually identify a real attack on this FTP server. The question warns you against this by saying \"changes should not impact visibility of malicious attacks\". This question is very typical type where the question designer first thinks of a feature (in this case auto-archiving from filters) and then tries to come up with a question to test that. It reeks of that (well intended but intrinsically flawed) approach"

It delivers all of your data in a reliable, timely, and simple manner. It also emits Amazon CloudWatch metrics to help you better monitor and troubleshoot the streaming process.\n\nBy default, records are parsed from each file based on the newline ('\\n') character. However, the agent can also be configured to parse multi-line records (see Agent Configuration Settings).\n\nYou can install the agent on Linux-based server environments such as web servers, log servers, and database servers. After installing the agent, configure it by specifying the files to monitor and the stream for the data. After the agent is configured, it durably collects data from the files and reliably sends it to the stream."

Configure the CMK key policy to allow AWS KMS actions only when the kms:ViaService condition matches the Amazon S3 service name.\n\nTo constrain an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to work only with Amazon S3, the CMK key policy can be configured to allow AWS KMS actions only when the kms:ViaService condition matches the Amazon S3 service name. This will ensure that the CMK can only be used by Amazon S3 to perform encrypt and decrypt operations, and cannot be used by other AWS services. Additionally, the CMK key policy can be configured to allow only the Amazon S3 service to use the kms:Encrypt action, which will further restrict the CMK to only be used for encrypting data with Amazon S3. This approach will help to limit the blast radius of the CMK, as it will only be able to be used with a single AWS service, and will not be able to be used by other services or IAM users.

The following summary describes the architecture:<br>1. An Application Load Balancer, an internet gateway and a NAT gateway are configured in the pubic subnet.<br>2. Database, application, and web servers are configured on three different private subnets.<br>3. The VPC has two route tables: one for the public subnet and one for all other subnets. The route table for the public subnet has a 0.0.0.0/0 route to the internet gateway. The route table for all other subnets has a 0.0.0.0/0 route to the NAT gateway. All private subnets can route to each other.<br>4. Each subnet has a network ACL implemented that limits all inbound and outbound connectivity to only the required ports and protocols.<br>5. There are 3 Security Groups (SGs): database, application, and web. Each group limits all inbound and outbound connectivity to the minimum required.<br>Which of the following accurately reflects the access control mechanisms the Architect should verify?<br>",

Also, AWS KMS cannot create key material for a CMK that is created without key material.\n\nTo reimport key material, use the same procedure that you used to import the key material the first time, with the following exceptions.\n\nUse an existing CMK, instead of creating a new CMK. You can skip Step 1 of the import procedure.\nIf the CMK contains key material, you must delete the existing key material before you reimport the key material.\nEach time you import key material to a CMK, you need to download and use a new wrapping key and import token for the CMK. The wrapping procedure does not affect the content of the key material, so you can use different wrapping keys (and different import tokens) to import the same key material."

If the user does have permissions, they'll get clear-text data back, not encrypted.  Limits cryptanalysis necessary for \"key wear-out\".\nB. Incorrect since S3 doesn't encrypt/decrypt objects within KMS - only the data-encryption keys.  The objects are encrypted/decrypted in S3.\nC. Correct - limits blast radius.\nD. Incorrect the data is larger than the very small 4KB limit for data-encryption using a CMK directly.  S3 doesn't do this anyway - it creates DEKs for each object (which is why C is applicable for blast-radius).\nE. Cryptographic wear-out is a loose term that describes a condition where enough data has been encrypted by a key to make cryptanalyis somewhat feasible.  Signing a master key would have no effect."

Rather, you have to interface directly with the HSM to do the encryption and then store the encrypted text at rest (S3 in this case).  That would more closely align with answer B."

When a client requests a DNS resolution for a domain name with multivalue answer routing enabled, Route 53 randomly selects and returns one of the configured IP addresses, distributing traffic across the different resources associated with the domain name.\n\nThis feature is useful when you have multiple resources that can serve a single application or website, and you want to distribute traffic evenly across all available resources. It also provides a measure of fault tolerance, as if one of the resources becomes unavailable, Route 53 will automatically route traffic to the remaining resources.\n\nhttps://repost.aws/knowledge-center/multivalue-versus-simple-policies"

There are four reasons why you might find a custom key store useful. Firstly, you might have keys that are explicitly required to be protected in a single tenant HSM or in an HSM over which you have direct control. Secondly, you might have keys that are required to be stored in an HSM that has been validated to FIPS 140-2 level 3 overall (the HSMs used in the standard AWS KMS key store are either validated or in the process of being validated to level 2 with level 3 in multiple categories). Thirdly, you might need the ability to immediately remove key material from AWS KMS and to prove you have done so by independent means. Finally, you might have a requirement to be able to audit all use of your keys independently of AWS KMS or AWS CloudTrail.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/kms/faqs/"

It integrates directly with the StartLogging API which makes it more efficient in this particular use case as it can detect the StopLogging event and react to it by calling the StartLogging API."

But what you don't get to check is if there's an explicit deny on the S3 for whatever reason. And it's true that S3 policies have more authority than IAM Roles, since ownership of the object is a thing.\n\nIt's an unfair question, but D is the one with more power."

Then, add IAM principle to the boundary.\n- C: Sounds like good practice, isolate the role that can create other roles.\n- D: Sounds scalable, should be easy to determine who has access to what\n- E: Not really scalable, we want to avoid using groups (i.e, you create a new account, you need to recreate the groups)\n- F: Not scalable, creating IAM policies for each data classification and type, for *each* account? Does each developer have a separate role? D is more more scalable.\n\nI'd therefore go A, C and D (over F)."

However, the s3:DeleteBucketPolicy API call and the s3:PutBucketPolicy API call do invoke an event.<br><br>The security team has enabled CloudTrail for AWS management events with a basic configuration in the AWS Region in which EventBridge is being tested. Verification of the EventBridge event pattern indicates that the pattern is set up correctly. The security team must implement a solution so that the s3:PutObjectAcl API call will invoke an EventBridge event. The solution must not generate false notifications.<br><br>Which solution will meet these requirements?",

A VPC Endpoint for Amazon S3 enables instances in your VPC to use their private IP addresses to access S3 with no exposure to the public internet. AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to create a privately routed connection between the VPC and S3.\n\nThe issue described in the question arises because when the Lambda function requires access to S3, it is using the NAT Gateway instead of the VPC Endpoint. This is likely due to the route table of the private subnet pointing to the NAT Gateway for 0.0.0.0/0 (all IP address space), causing all traffic to be routed to the internet via the NAT Gateway, including traffic intended for S3.\n\nTo ensure the Lambda function uses the S3 VPC Endpoint and not the NAT Gateway, you should remove the route to the NAT Gateway from the route table of the private subnet that the Lambda function uses. This ensures that the traffic destined for S3 will use the VPC Endpoint."

The Lambda execution role can include the necessary permissions to use the KMS key, allowing the Lambda function to access the encrypted data in the S3 bucket. This approach ensures that each Lambda function has its own distinct set of permissions and provides isolation of access control for each function.\n\nOn the other hand, Option B (creating a key grant for the Lambda service principal) would grant permissions directly to the Lambda service principal itself rather than to individual Lambda functions. This approach would not provide separate programmatic access control permissions for each Lambda function, as all functions would share the same permissions granted to the Lambda service principal.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the correct choice to ensure that each Lambda function has its own programmatic access control permissions to use the KMS key."

This is because Amazon Route 53 automatically recognizes the relationship between the domain and its subdomains within the same account. \n\nHowever, when the DNS zones are in different accounts, you need to explicitly create NS records in the parent zone to delegate authority to the subdomain\u2019s zone. This ensures that DNS queries for the subdomain are correctly routed to its zone, regardless of which account it\u2019s in."
