Question says \"you have set up Individual aws accounts for each project\" so we know each project has their own AWS account. \nD states: \"Set up cloudwatch billing alerts for all AWS resources used by each account\". So each account's billing is being differentiated therefore each project is being differentiated. \n\nAdditionally D has alerts at thresholds (50%, 80%, 90%) so you can take action accordingly to avoid going over the budget\n\nbut look at C's alert:\n\"with a notification occurring when the amount for each resource tagged to a particular project matches the budget allocated to the project. \"\nmatches the budget allocated to the project means the total budget.

This feature needs two security groups: the source security group and a security group that defines the ingress rules for the back-end instances. To ensure that traffic only flows between the load balancer and the back-end instances, the user can add or modify a rule to the back-end security group which can limit the ingress traffic. Thus, it can come only from the source security group provided by Elastic Load Balancing.",

The Elastic Load Balancer provides a feature called sticky session which binds the user's session with a specific EC2 instance. If the sticky session is enabled the first request from the user will be redirected to any of the EC2 instances. But, henceforth, all requests from the same user will be redirected to the same EC2 instance. This ensures that all requests coming from the user during the session will be sent to the same application instance.",

Running a DB instance with high availability can enhance availability during planned system maintenance, and help protect your databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone disruption. Note that the high-availability feature is not a scaling solution for read-only scenarios; you cannot use a standby replica to serve read traffic. To service read-only traffic, you should use a read replica.",

As per link below, alludes to B : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/con-bill-blended-rates.html\n\n\"The preceding example shows how using consolidated billing in AWS Organizations helps lower the overall monthly cost of storage. If you calculate the cost for each member account separately, the total cost is $7,660 rather than $6,720. By aggregating the usage of the three accounts, you reach the lower-priced tiers sooner. The most expensive storage, the first TB, is charged at the highest price just once, rather than three times. For example, three TB of storage at the most expensive rate of $100/TB would result in a charge of $300. Charging this storage as 1 TB ($100) and two additional TB at $80 ($160) results in a total charge of $260.\"\""

When the user is launching an instance he needs to select an option which attaches a public IP to the instance. If the user has not selected the option to attach the public IP, then it will only have a private IP when launched. If the user wants to connect to an instance from the Internet, he should create an elastic IP with VPC. If the elastic IP is a part of EC2 Classic, it cannot be assigned to a VPC instance.",

If the user has created a public private subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic directly from the internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are created with Wizard, AWS will create a NAT instance of a smaller or higher size, respectively. The<br>VPC has an implied router and the VPC wizard updates the main route table used with the private subnet, creates a custom route table and associates it with the public subnet.",

If they now all retry after 5 seconds, all will get the same error again and they will ultimately fail. That's why adding an exponential backoff with a jitter helps to prevent this from happening.\nI mean in general I think that adding a jitter and exponential backoff when retrying an api request is a good idea to prevent congestion.\"\nhttps://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/6980"

This means that partial hours cost as much as one full hour. Pricing is per instance-hour consumed for each instance, from the time an instance is launched until it is terminated or stopped. Each partial instance-hour consumed will be billed as a full hour.<br>With EC2 services now billed per-second in some cases, as well as per-hour in others as of October 2, 2017, there is more to consider. Amazon AWS is still based on the concept of pay-as-you-go. You pay Amazon EC2 instances by the second for all instance types except Dedicated Host, which is still billed per instance-hour. You are billed per second when using Linux operating systems with no separate hourly charge, and billed per hour when using Windows operating systems.<br>Reference:<br>http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/",

It can automatically adjust the number of instances to match the workload and ensure optimal resource utilization.\n\nFor applications that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage, Auto Scaling is particularly beneficial. It can dynamically scale the number of instances up or down to match the changing demand. This flexibility allows the application to handle peak loads efficiently while reducing costs during periods of lower demand."

You can configure your VPC: you can select its IP ad-dress range, create subnets, and configure route tables, network gateways, and security settings. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a subnet that you select. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the<br>Internet. If a subnet's traffic is routed to an in-ternet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet. If a subnet doesn't have a route to the Inter-net gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet. If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet.<br>Reference:<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html",

When you publish a custom metric, you can define it as either standard resolution or high resolution. When you publish a high-resolution metric, CloudWatch stores it with a resolution of 1 second, and you can read and retrieve it with a period of 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or any multiple of 60 seconds.\n\nHigh-resolution metrics can give you more immediate insight into your application's sub-minute activity. Keep in mind that every PutMetricData call for a custom metric is charged, so calling PutMetricData more often on a high-resolution metric can lead to higher charges.

The user can publish data to CloudWatch as single data points or as an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set using the command put-metric-data. It is recommended that when the user is having multiple data points per minute, he should aggregate the data so that it will minimize the number of calls to put-metric- data. In this case it will be single call to CloudWatch instead of 1000 calls if the data is aggregated.<br>Reference:<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html",

For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Ama-zon EC2) instances and then use this data to determine whether you should launch additional in-stances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money. In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics.

The AZRebalance process type seeks to maintain a balanced number of in-stances across Availability Zones within a region. If the user suspends the Terminate process, the AZRebalance process can cause the Auto Scaling group to grow up to ten percent larger than the maximum size. This is because Auto Scaling allows groups to temporarily grow larger than the max-imum size during rebalancing activities. If Auto Scaling cannot terminate instances, the Auto Scal-ing group could remain up to ten percent larger than the maximum size until the user resumes the Terminate process type.<br>Reference:<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/US_SuspendResume.html",

AZ Rebalancing is a feature of Auto Scaling that helps distribute instances evenly across Availability Zones.\n\nDuring this period, if AZ Rebalancing is triggered, it may move instances between Availability Zones to balance the capacity and maintain an even distribution. As a result, the number of instances in a specific Availability Zone may remain higher than the defined maximum size for that zone."

    "answerDescription": "Permissions can be assigned in two ways: as identity-based or as resource-based. Identity-based, or IAM permissions, are attached to an IAM user, group, or role and let you specify what that user, group, or role can do. For example, you can assign permissions to the IAM user named Bob, stating that he has permission to use the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) RunInstances ac-tion and that he has permission to get items from an Amazon DynamoDB table named<br>MyCompa-ny. The user Bob might also be granted access to manage his own IAM security credentials. Identi-ty-based permissions can be managed or inline.<br>Resource-based permissions are attached to a resource. You can specify resource-based permissions for Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon Glacier vaults, Amazon<br>SNS topics, Amazon SQS queues, and AWS Key Management Service encryption keys. Resource-based permissions let you specify who has access to the resource and what actions they can perform on it. Resource-based policies are in-line only, not managed.<br>Reference:<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_permissions.html",

For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an ELB load balancer in the Frankfurt region.\n\nWhen you use geolocation routing, you can localize your content and present some or all of your website in the language of your users. You can also use geolocation routing to restrict distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights. Another possible use is for balancing load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way, so that each user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint."

For more information and an example, see the discussion of the max_allowed_packet parameter in the next section.\n\nDisable the query cache. For tables that are modified often, using the query cache can increase replica lag because the cache is locked and refreshed often. If this is the case, you might see less replica lag if you disable the query cache.

Definite scaling at the beginning of the day. 2. Advanced scaling in anticipation will ensure that you don't have to wait for the scaling event to trigger and then launch instances. Also if it needs pre-warming then it will add to the delay.\nSince they have specifically mentioned that the delay is observed at the 'beginning of each business day', this is a perfect case for scheduled scaling."

It is essential to configure the health check settings to ensure that the instances are healthy and capable of serving traffic. The ALB periodically checks the health of the instances based on the configured health check settings and directs traffic only to healthy instances.\n\nTo improve the security of the application, it is recommended to restrict access to the EC2 instances from only the ALB. This can be achieved by modifying the security group rules for the instances and allowing inbound traffic only from the security group associated with the ALB. This ensures that traffic is allowed only from the ALB and not directly from the public internet. Additionally, removing the public IPs from the instances enhances security by preventing direct access to the instances."

AWS KMS generates this event on a best-effort basis.\"\n\"When you schedule deletion of a KMS key, AWS KMS enforces a waiting period before deleting the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key and sends a KMS CMK Deletion event to EventBridge. AWS KMS guarantees this EventBridge event.\"\nBecause there is no guarantee for the CMK Rotation event in EventBridge, it is better to use CloudTrail instead of EventBridge."

By specifying an AutoScalingUpdate policy in the CloudFormation template, you can define the update behavior for your Auto Scaling group, including how many instances should be replaced at a time.\n\nTo update the AMI while maintaining service continuity, you can configure the AutoScalingUpdate policy to replace a subset of instances at a time. This ensures that the service remains available by keeping a minimum number of active instances running while new instances with the updated AMI are launched. The Auto Scaling group will gradually replace the instances until all instances are running the new AMI."

My observations in real webservers says that when we have high DISK latency, processing individual tasks could take much much longer. In high concurrency systems, a task taking longer means that you will end up having more parallel tasks being executed at the same time. With such a scenario, with parallel tasks being accumulated because of disk latency, the CPU usage will increase. So, disk latency could be a real CPU killer. \n\nLetter (B) is a good solution, but it is vertical scalling. The question states that it can not be vertical scalled. So, I am taking this out."

Setting the concurrency to 1 will make it throttle even more.

It has no effect on concurrent executions since the function will still execute until it finishes a certain timeframe. \n\nThe answer should be D. Increasing the memory will increase the CPU power of the Lambda function and therefore will execute faster."

CloudTrail log file integrity validation uses industry standard algorithms: SHA-256 for hashing and SHA-256 with<br>RSA for digital signing. This makes it computationally unfeasible to modify, delete or forge CloudTrail log files without detection. T<br>Configuring multi-factor authentication (MFA) ensures that any attempt to change the versioning state of your bucket or permanently delete an object version requires additional authentication. This helps prevent any operation that could compromise the integrity of your log files, even if a user acquires the password of an IAM user that has permissions to permanently delete Amazon S3 objects.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/best-practices-security.html",

On the other hand, for \"automatic key rotation\", it can happen on both customer managed or AWS managed CMKs, the difference is that one is optional for each 1 year and the other is required for each 3 years.

You could have your developers store AWS credentials directly within the EC2 instance and allow applications in that instance to use those credentials. But developers would then have to manage the credentials and ensure that they securely pass the credentials to each instance and update each EC2 instance when it's time to rotate the credentials. That's a lot of additional work.\nInstead, you can and should use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that run on an EC2 instance. When you use a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a user name and password or access keys) to an EC2 instance. Instead, the role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use when they make calls to other AWS resources. When you launch an EC2 instance, you specify an IAM role to associate with the instance. Applications that run on the instance can then use the role-supplied temporary credentials to sign API requests."

Unlike the host memory, which leads to swap usage when exceeded, the cache memory limit is defined by your node type and number of nodes. The evictions follow the method defined in your cache configuration, such as LRU for Redis. Evicting a large number of keys can decrease your hit rate, leading to longer latency times. If your eviction rate is steady and your cache hit rate isn\u2019t abnormal, then your cache has probably enough memory. If the number of evictions is growing, you should increase your cache size by migrating to a larger node type (or adding more nodes if you use Memcached).\""

You, and only you, can also \u201cunshare\u201d your portfolio at any time. Any products, or stacks, currently in use will continue to run until the stack owner decides to terminate them.\n\nTo share your portfolio, you specify the account ID you want to share with, and then send the Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the portfolio to that account.

In SCPs, you can restrict which AWS services, resources, and individual API actions the users and roles in each member account can access. You can also define conditions for when to restrict access to AWS services, resources, and API actions. These restrictions even override the administrators of member accounts in the organization. When AWS Organizations blocks access to a service, resource, or API action for a member account, a user or role in that account can't access it. This block remains in effect even if an administrator of a member account explicitly grants such permissions in an IAM policy.\n\nI want to add this: \nn other words, the user can access only what is allowed by both the AWS Organizations policies and IAM policies. If either blocks an operation, the user can't access that operation.\n\nLink:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html"

This will help you maintain application performance, improve application availability and reduce costs.\n\nThis metric is integrated with Auto Scaling through a new type of scaling policy called target tracking scaling policies where you select this metric as a load metric for your application, set the target value, and Auto Scaling adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group as needed to maintain that target value. For example, you can configure target tracking scaling policy for your Auto Scaling Group to keep RequestCountPerTarget at 1000 for your webserver fleet. From there, Auto Scaling launches or terminates EC2 instances as required to keep RequestCountPerTarget at 1000.\n\nAns. D"

Add Amazon CloudFront caching for static content:\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that caches and distributes content globally to provide low-latency and high-performance access to static and dynamic content. By caching static content (such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript) in CloudFront, you can serve those resources from edge locations closer to the site visitors, reducing the loading times significantly.\n\nD. Implement Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for the web servers:\nAmazon EC2 Auto Scaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. By implementing EC2 Auto Scaling for the web servers behind the ALB, you can automatically add more instances during periods of high traffic and remove instances during periods of low traffic. This ensures that the website can handle varying levels of traffic and provide consistent performance."

Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.\n\nS3 Glacier enforces the controls set in the vault lock policy to help achieve your compliance objectives, for example, for data retention. You can deploy a variety of compliance controls in a vault lock policy using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language. For more information about vault lock policies, see Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies."

Reserved Instances provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instances when you commit to a one- or three-year term. Since the control nodes are essential components that run continuously, using Reserved Instances for them can help save costs while ensuring stability.\n\nE. Use Spot Instances for the worker nodes and On-Demand Instances if there is no Spot availability.\n\nExplanation: This option suggests using Spot Instances for the worker nodes, which is a viable cost-effective approach. Spot Instances offer substantial cost savings but can be subject to interruptions if the Spot price exceeds your bid or if there is insufficient capacity. By having a fallback plan to use On-Demand Instances when Spot Instances are not available or too expensive, the company can maintain the necessary computing capacity while still benefiting from Spot pricing when it's available."

When you run an assessment with this rules package, Inspector queries AWS APIs to read network configurations in your account such as Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), security groups, network access control lists (ACLs), and route tables. then analyzes these network configurations to prove accessibility of ports. Findings show you the network configurations that allow access to a reachable port to help you easily restrict access as needed.

Amazon CloudWatch alarms are used to notify when an error occurs with a Lambda function; this notification does not give any specifics about the error. For scenarios where you need specificity on the error in the notification, you can use a CloudWatch Logs subscription. CloudWatch Logs subscriptions let you match entries with a particular error pattern in your log and be notified with those error details. This saves you an extra step to parse through the logs and take necessary action. You can also use this as a blueprint to build automated reactive measures when that error pattern is detected in your Lambda function.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/get-notified-specific-lambda-function-error-patterns-using-cloudwatch/"

The DNS should point to the CloudFront distribution to ensure that requests are served by CloudFront.\n\nD. The default, minimum, and maximum Time to Live (TTL) are set to 0 seconds on the CloudFront distribution. If the TTL values are set to 0, CloudFront would not cache the responses and would forward every request to the ALB, resulting in no change in the load on the web servers. The TTL values should be increased to enable caching in CloudFront.\n\nOption A is not likely because the Origin Access Identity (OAI) is used when the origin of the CloudFront distribution is an S3 bucket. Option C is not likely because CloudFront does not send requests to the ALB; instead, the ALB serves as the origin for the CloudFront distribution. Option E is not likely because sticky sessions determine how requests from a client are routed to targets in the target group, but they do not affect how requests are routed between CloudFront and the ALB."

The DNS is still pointing to the ALB instead of the CloudFront distribution.\n\nExplanation: When you set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an ALB as the origin, you need to ensure that the DNS (Domain Name System) is configured to point to the CloudFront distribution's domain name (e.g., d12345abcdefg.cloudfront.net) instead of directly to the ALB's endpoint (e.g., my-alb.example.com). If the DNS is still pointing directly to the ALB, requests will bypass CloudFront, and the load will not be reduced on the web servers.\n\nD. The default, minimum, and maximum Time to Live (TTL) are set to 0 seconds on the CloudFront distribution.\n\nExplanation: The Time to Live (TTL) settings in CloudFront control how long CloudFront caches objects before fetching a fresh copy from the origin server (in this case, the ALB). If the TTL settings are set to 0 seconds, it effectively disables caching in CloudFront, and every request will go directly to the ALB, resulting in no reduction in web server load."
