Yes, the support page says to make a snapshot, but that's in case you mess up and forget to change the RDS database deletion policy to not delete the database.  You also need to do a blue-green deployment so that traffic hits the new environment (which points to the existing database but isn't coupled to it).  You can decouple the database using the Beanstalk console, the AWS CLI or the eb CLI.  I think the eb CLI is easiest, but sadly this means there is more than one correct answer here."

Option C is the correct answer. This approach would decouple the transactions from the Lambda function and the RDS database, allowing for better scalability and fault tolerance. Turning on enhanced fanout for the Lambda function would also allow for faster processing of the transactions. Migrating to Amazon Aurora MySQL with read replicas (options A and B) would provide better performance, but it may not be the most cost-effective solution. Option D is incorrect because setting the reserved concurrency of the Lambda function to be less than the number of database connections would limit the processing capacity of the function and may cause a bottleneck"

Create a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster: DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory cache for DynamoDB that can significantly improve the performance of read-intensive workloads. By creating a DAX cluster and configuring the application to use it, the frequently accessed data can be cached in memory, reducing the need to fetch it from the DynamoDB table directly. This can result in reduced latency and improved read performance.\n\nD. Increase the read capacity of the DynamoDB table: Scaling up the read capacity of the DynamoDB table can improve performance by allowing more read requests to be processed simultaneously. By increasing the provisioned read capacity units, the table can handle a higher number of concurrent read requests and serve the data more quickly. This approach is effective when the workload involves a large number of concurrent read requests."

When you configure Elastic Beanstalk to use immutable updates for application deployments, it replaces all instances in your environment every time you deploy a new version of your application. If an immutable application deployment fails, Elastic Beanstalk reverts the changes immediately by terminating the new Auto Scaling group. This can prevent partial fleet deployments, which can occur when a rolling deployment fails after some batches have already completed. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environmentmgmt-updates-immutable.html\n\nA is my answer."

This will ensure that all the data stored on the attached Amazon EBS disks is encrypted at rest. The encryption is performed transparently to the application and does not impact performance significantly. Creating an encrypted AMI with an encrypted root volume is an option, but it only encrypts the root volume, not the attached EBS disks. Writing data to an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket or adding a custom encryption algorithm to the application may also work, but they are not specific to the attached EBS disks and could potentially impact performance."

This is is what it says today - The most likely cause of the duplicate invocations is that the Lambda function did not run correctly, and AWS Lambda is automatically retrying the invocation. When a Lambda function returns an error, Lambda automatically retries the invocation twice, with delays between retries. If the function continues to return an error, the invocation is not retried further. The developer can check the Lambda function's error handling and logging to diagnose and resolve the issue. Additionally, the developer can configure the function's concurrency limit to avoid invoking the function multiple times concurrently, and use a dead-letter queue to capture events that are not processed successfully."

This can cause calls to AWS services to exceed the maximum allowed time and generate a \"timed out\" error. You can use the --page-size option to specify that the AWS CLI request a smaller number of items from each call to the AWS service. The AWS CLI still retrieves the full list, but performs a larger number of service API calls in the background and retrieves a smaller number of items with each call. This gives the individual calls a better chance of succeeding without a timeout. Changing the page size doesn't affect the output; it affects only the number of API calls that need to be made to generate the output.\n\n\n$ aws s3api list-objects \\\n    --bucket my-bucket \\\n    --page-size 100\n{\n    \"Contents\": ["

This header is typically used when you want to invoke a Lambda function asynchronously, but it doesn't ensure that you get an immediate response. It essentially sends the request to a queue for asynchronous execution and doesn't wait for the processing to complete before providing a response.\n\nIn contrast, option D suggests using the X-Amz-Target header with a static value of 'Async,' which is a more appropriate choice when you need to provide an immediate response to the client while offloading the processing for background execution. This approach better aligns with the requirement of displaying a message to the user while the files are being processed, which is typically achieved through asynchronous processing with notification upon completion."

In addition, in the event the number of your web servers change, for example a scale-up scenario, it\u2019s possible that the traffic may be unequally spread across the web servers as active sessions may exist on particular servers.

The user pool allows for user authentication and management, while the identity pool provides temporary AWS credentials that grant access to AWS resources. By configuring the identity pool to allow unauthenticated users, guest users can obtain temporary AWS credentials without the need for authentication. The developer can also define fine-grained access control policies to ensure that users see only their data.\n\nOption B is not a recommended solution as it would require hardcoding of IAM credentials, which is not secure. Option C and D do not provide a solution for user authentication and management, which is a requirement for the application. Therefore, option A is the best solution to meet the requirements while also providing a secure and scalable architecture."

    "body": "A developer is designing a serverless application that customers use to select seats for a concert venue. Customers send the ticket requests to an Amazon API Gateway API with an AWS Lambda function that acknowledges the order and generates an order ID. The application includes two additional Lambda functions: one for inventory management and one for payment processing. These two Lambda functions run in parallel and write the order to an Amazon Dynamo DB table.<br><br>The application must provide seats to customers according to the following requirements. If a seat is accidently sold more than once, the first order that the application received must get the seat. In these cases, the application must process the payment for only the first order. However, if the first order is rejected during payment processing, the second order must get the seat. In these cases, the application must process the payment for the second order.<br><br>Which solution will meet these requirements?",

While this approach can offload the processing of the metrics to the Lambda function, it introduces additional latency as the metrics need to be queued and then processed by the Lambda function, which can take some time.\n\nAdditionally, the question specifically mentions that the response data from the PutMetricData API is not necessary to create the web service response. Therefore, it is not necessary to wait for a response from the API before returning a response to the caller.\n\nOn the other hand, Option B suggests calling the PutMetricData API in a background thread, which can improve the response time of the web service since the API call can be made asynchronously without waiting for a response. This approach can help decouple the metric publishing process from the web service response, allowing the web service to return results to the caller as quickly as possible."

If a background thread is started within a Lambda function and any work is still running after the lambda timeout expires, the thread will be forcibly terminated. Starting a background thread within a Lambda function can be a useful technique, but it's important to be aware of the potential implications on function execution time.\nThe correct answer is D as the adopted approach is asynchronous which goes in line with the requirement to return results to the caller as quickly as possible as we don't care if the response data from PutMetricData API is received or not to create a web service response."

Because while the container is not handling any request, it is in the frozen state. AWS Lambda doesn\u2019t allocate CPU resource/slot in frozen state, so background threads can\u2019t publish monitoring data.

Define a resource-based policy on the S3 bucket to deny access when a request meets the condition \"aws:SecureTransport\": \"false\".\n\nThis option is the correct solution to enforce that all requests to retrieve the data provide encryption in transit. By defining a resource-based policy on the S3 bucket, you can specify the \"aws:SecureTransport\" condition to deny access to any request that does not use encryption in transit. This ensures that all requests to retrieve the data are encrypted in transit, which is a requirement for the sensitive data stored in the S3 bucket.\nOption C is also incorrect because it only applies to the other accounts' roles, and not to all requests to retrieve the data."

This is achieved by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. FIFO queues are designed to ensure that the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved and that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it.\nBy creating an AWS Lambda function to process the requests and setting the SQS FIFO queue as an event source for the Lambda function, the application can write the requests to the SQS queue and the Lambda function will process them in the order that they arrive, without any duplicates. This improves the reliability of the delivery and processing of the requests."

However, it does not address the issue of duplicate messages arriving. FIFO queues do not prevent duplicate messages from being sent, but they ensure that they are processed in the order that they are received.\n\nTo prevent duplicates, the application needs to be modified to implement deduplication logic. Option C suggests using an AWS Lambda function to process the requests and an Amazon SQS standard queue as an event source. With this configuration, the application can enable deduplication on the queue to ensure that messages are not duplicated. Therefore, option C is a better solution than option D for this scenario."

This can introduce some delay between the time changes are made to the CodeCommit repository and the time the pipeline is triggered.\n\nOverall, if the goal is to trigger the AWS CodePipeline with the least delay possible, using AWS CodePipeline's webhook feature is the recommended approach."

Implement a conditional put by using the attribute_not_exists(transactionID) condition expression.\n\nBy using the attribute_not_exists condition expression in the PutItem operation, you can ensure that a new item is only added to the table if the item with the specified primary key does not already exist in the table.

It is used to automatically delete expired items in a DynamoDB table.\n\nOption C is also a possible solution, but it requires additional read capacity units (RCUs) to check if the record exists before inserting a new item.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most efficient and cost-effective solution to prevent PutItem from updating an existing record.\nBy: GPT"

This means that the app instances behind the load balancer do not need to handle user authentication or have access to the AWS credentials required to access the DynamoDB table directly. Instead, the Lambda authorizer can use the security credentials of the user to authenticate and authorize their access to the data stored in DynamoDB.

The app is doing READS a lot, and few WRITES.\nThat means LAZY LOADING is better. \nWhen it comes to TTL, postcode and geolocation is not something that changes frequently. So, you can go for larger TTL. It saves cost, cache is not invalidated too often, and you will not need to update cache very often. Also, your requests will be very fast, since it will directly read from cache.\nShortly, the answer is D."

By using a write-through caching strategy, the application writes data to the cache and the database simultaneously.

You can add other information to the segment document as annotations and metadata. Annotations and metadata are aggregated at the trace level, and can be added to any segment or subsegment.\n\nAnnotations are simple key-value pairs that are indexed for use with filter expressions. Use annotations to record data that you want to use to group traces in the console, or when calling the GetTraceSummaries API.\n\nX-Ray indexes up to 50 annotations per trace.\n\nMetadata are key-value pairs with values of any type, including objects and lists, but that are not indexed. Use metadata to record data you want to store in the trace but don't need to use for searching traces.\n\nYou can view annotations and metadata in the segment or subsegment details in the X-Ray console."

When using eventually consistent reads, DynamoDB returns the latest data that it has in its cache, which may be slightly out of date.

Using eventually consistent reads will reduce the number of RCUs required to read the table because DynamoDB does not need to wait for all copies of the data to be updated before returning the data. Using strongly consistent reads or transactional reads would require more RCUs because these read modes require DynamoDB to wait for all copies of the data to be updated before returning the data.

These limit settings exist to prevent your API\u2014and your account\u2014from being overwhelmed by too many requests. These limits are set by AWS and can't be changed by a customer.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-usage-plans-with-console.html#api-gateway-usage-plan-create\nChoose Enable quota, and set specify a value (for example, 5000) for a selected time interval (for example, Month)."

Configure the Lambda function to periodically poll the Amazon SQS queue for messages. You can use the AWS SDK or AWS Lambda triggers to trigger the function when there are messages in the queue.\n\n3. Within the Lambda function, retrieve the API calls from the queue and make the necessary API requests to the third-party service. Ensure that the Lambda function respects the API threshold limits for each minute and each day."

Instead, the Lambda function can retrieve the value once during initialization and store it in memory, reducing the overhead of additional API calls.\n\nHere's how the solution would work:\n\nRetrieve the RDS DB cluster endpoint value from the SSM Parameter Store outside the Lambda function handler, preferably during the initialization phase of the Lambda function.\nStore the retrieved value in an environment variable.\nAccess the environment variable within the Lambda function handler to use the RDS DB cluster endpoint value.\nBy following this approach, the Lambda function can reuse the stored value from the environment variable for subsequent invocations, eliminating the need to make additional API calls to the SSM Parameter Store."

This will help to reduce latency and improve the overall performance of the function.\n\nThe other options are not as effective or cost-effective.\n\n    Storing the geospatial dataset on Amazon EFS instead of on Amazon S3 will increase the cost of the function. EFS is a more expensive storage service than S3.\n    Caching the data in the /tmp directory for use with every invocation is not a good solution for a large geospatial dataset. The /tmp directory is a temporary directory that is cleared between invocations.\n    Increasing the memory capacity of the function will increase the cost of the function.

The delivery stream can then be configured to automatically convert the logs to JSON format by using an AWS Lambda function, and then pushes the logs to OpenSearch Service cluster. This allows the company to consume logs from Apache HTTP servers at a large scale with near real-time processing."

    "body": "A company uses a custom root certificate authority certificate chain (Root CA Cert) that is 10 KB in size to generate SSL certificates for its on-premises HTTPS endpoints. One of the company\u2019s cloud-based applications has hundreds of AWS Lambda functions that pull data from these endpoints. A developer updated the trust store of the Lambda execution environment to use the Root CA Cert when the Lambda execution environment is initialized. The developer bundled the Root CA Cert as a text file in the Lambda deployment bundle.<br><br>After 3 months of development, the Root CA Cert is no longer valid and must be updated. The developer needs a more efficient solution to update the Root CA Cert for all deployed Lambda functions. The solution must not include rebuilding or updating all Lambda functions that use the Root CA Cert. The solution must also work for all development, testing, and production environments. Each environment is managed in a separate AWS account.<br><br>Which combination of steps should the developer take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)",
