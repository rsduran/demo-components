The company has set up a shared AWS account for the connection to its on-premises data centers and the company offices. The workloads consist of private web-based services for internal use. These services run in different AWS accounts. Office-based employees consume these services by using a DNS name in an on-premises DNS zone that is named example.internal.<br>The process to register a new service that runs on AWS requires a manual and complicated change request to the internal DNS. The process involves many teams.<br>The company wants to update the DNS registration process by giving the service creators access that will allow them to register their DNS records. A network engineer must design a solution that will achieve this goal. The solution must maximize cost-effectiveness and must require the least possible number of configuration changes.<br>Which combination of steps should the network engineer take to meet these requirements?

However, this is not necessary to allow the unified CloudWatch agent to continue working after the removal of the NAT gateway. In fact, creating inbound rules for port 443 is not related to the problem statement, since the issue is about ensuring the CloudWatch agent can communicate with AWS services without using a NAT gateway.\n\nCreating inbound rules would only be necessary if you wanted to allow external traffic to access resources within your VPC over HTTPS on port 443."

When you specify a resource in the DependsOn attribute of another resource, AWS CloudFormation creates the specified resource first before creating the resource with the DependsOn attribute.\n\nIn this case, the error might be occurring because the CloudFormation template is attempting to create the route table entry before the virtual private gateway is created. By adding the DependsOn attribute to the resource declaration for the route table entry and specifying the virtual private gateway resource, you ensure that the virtual private gateway is created before the route table entry.\n\nOption B is incorrect because adding DependsOn to the route table entry for the virtual private gateway is more appropriate than specifying the route table entry for the virtual private gateway."

    "body": "A company operates its IT services through a multi-site hybrid infrastructure. The company deploys resources on AWS in the us-east-1 Region and in the eu-west-2 Region. The company also deploys resources in its own data centers that are located in the United States (US) and in the United Kingdom (UK). In both AWS Regions, the company uses a transit gateway to connect 15 VPCs to each other. The company has created a transit gateway peering connection between the two transit gateways. The VPC CIDR blocks do not overlap with each other or with IP addresses used within the data centers. The VPC CIDR prefixes can also be aggregated either on a Regional level or for the company's entire AWS environment.<br>The data centers are connected to each other by a private WAN connection. IP routing information is exchanged dynamically through Interior BGP (iBGP) sessions. The data centers maintain connectivity to AWS through one AWS Direct Connect connection in the US and one Direct Connect connection in the UK. Each Direct Connect connection is terminated on a Direct Connect gateway and is associated with a local transit gateway through a transit VIF.<br>Traffic follows the shortest geographical path from source to destination. For example, packets from the UK data center that are targeted to resources in eu-west-2 travel across the local Direct Connect connection. In cases of cross-Region data transfers, such as from the UK data center to VPCs in us-east-1, the private WAN connection must be used to minimize costs on AWS. A network engineer has configured each transit gateway association on the Direct Connect gateway to advertise VPC-specific CIDR IP prefixes only from the local Region. The routes toward the other Region must be learned through BGP from the routers in the other data center in the original, non-aggregated form.<br>The company recently experienced a problem with cross-Region data transfers because of issues with its private WAN connection. The network engineer needs to modify the routing setup to prevent similar interruptions in the future. The solution cannot modify the original traffic routing goal when the network is operating normally.<br>Which modifications will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",

An Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone is the authoritative DNS service for the company and its internet applications, all of which are offered from the same domain name.<br>A network engineer is working on a new version of one of the applications. All the application's components are hosted in the AWS Cloud. The application has a three-tier design. The front end is delivered through Amazon EC2 instances that are deployed in public subnets with Elastic IP addresses assigned. The backend components are deployed in private subnets from RFC1918.<br>Components of the application need to be able to access other components of the application within the application's VPC by using the same host names as the host names that are used over the public internet.

Additionally, creating an S3 gateway endpoint in the VPC will enable the EC2 instances to communicate with Amazon S3 directly, without incurring data transfer costs. This is because the S3 gateway endpoint uses Amazon's private network to transfer data between the VPC and S3, which is not charged for data transfer. Furthermore, specifying the route table of the private subnets during endpoint creation will create routes to Amazon S3, which is required for the EC2 instances to communicate with S3."

This setup ensures that traffic between the VPCs in us-east-1 and on-premises databases is routed through the transit gateway, while traffic between the VPC in eu-west-1 and the on-premises server is routed directly through the private VIF."

However, instances might not achieve this bandwidth; for example, if they exceed network allowances at the instance level, such as packet per second or number of tracked connections. How much of the available bandwidth the traffic can utilize depends on the number of vCPUs and the destination. For example, an m5.16xlarge instance has 64 vCPUs, so traffic to another instance in the Region can utilize the full bandwidth available (20 Gbps). However, traffic to another instance in a different Region can utilize only 50% of the bandwidth available (10 Gbps)."

The application will be hosted on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group behind a publicly accessible Network Load Balancer (NLB).

It involves uploading the public key that handles encryption of the sensitive data to the CloudFront distribution, creating a field-level encryption profile to specify the fields containing sensitive information, and then creating a field-level encryption configuration and linking it to the appropriate cache behavior associated with sensitive POST requests.

If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Network Firewall. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history.
