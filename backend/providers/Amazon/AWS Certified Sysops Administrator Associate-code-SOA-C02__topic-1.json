Then I'd also figure out a lifecycle policy or some method to delete the logs sometimes after the 90 day requirement."

Scheduled scaling makes sense.\nScheduled scaling helps you to set up your own scaling schedule according to predictable load changes. For example, let's say that every week the traffic to your web application starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday. You can configure a schedule for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to increase capacity on Wednesday and decrease capacity on Friday.\n\nTo use scheduled scaling, you create scheduled actions. Scheduled actions are performed automatically as a function of date and time. When you create a scheduled action, you specify when the scaling activity should occur and the new desired, minimum, and maximum sizes for the scaling action. You can create scheduled actions that scale one time only or that scale on a recurring schedule.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html"

Furthermore, cluster placement will use a single availability zone, hence multi-AZ NLB is useless (so, no B). Finally, regarding ASG in a single subnet isn't resilient. Below I paste directly from AWS docs:\n\n\"If you try to add more instances to the placement group later, or if you try to launch more than one instance type in the placement group, you increase your chances of getting an insufficient capacity error.\"\n\nSo in case of a failed health check, ASG might try to spin up a new instance but receive an InsufficientInstanceCapacity (which is an AZ-specific error). Therefore, is not recommended when resiliency is needed. The only thing left is A. \n\nPS.\nNot a very good question, I believe a bit more context is required."

If you want your instance to be able to access the internet, but you want to prevent resources on the internet from initiating communication with your instance, you can use an egress-only internet gateway. To do this, create an egress-only internet gateway in your VPC, and then add a route to your route table that points all IPv6 traffic (::/0) or a specific range of IPv6 address to the egress-only internet gateway. IPv6 traffic in the subnet that's associated with the route table is routed to the egress-only internet gateway.\n\nAn egress-only internet gateway is stateful: it forwards traffic from the instances in the subnet to the internet or other AWS services, and then sends the response back to the instances."

This is crucial in identifying issues that may not be apparent from the application logs or infrastructure metrics.\n\nProactive monitoring: Synthetics canaries continuously monitor the website, allowing for early detection of issues before end-users report them. This helps in addressing problems before they impact users and helps maintain the website's reliability."

They are used for monitoring and logging network traffic, but they cannot be used for active traffic control.\n\nOption D (Create a new security group to block traffic to the external IP address and assign it to the entire VPC) is incorrect because, like in Option A, security groups are not meant to block traffic to specific external IP addresses.

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides a fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system so that users can access their files over the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The Amazon FSx File Gateway allows access to the file shares from on-premises Windows environments or from Windows instances running in the AWS Cloud with low latency. This solution avoids the need for using AWS Direct Connect, which is more suitable for high-throughput workloads, and eliminates the need for using AWS DataSync to move data between the on-premises file servers and AWS, as the file shares are natively hosted on AWS. Amazon S3 File Gateway, on the other hand, is used for providing a file interface to S3 object storage and does not natively support the SMB protocol, making it unsuitable for this scenario."

This can be achieved using a custom parameter group, which allows you to configure specific database settings.\n\nWhen you enforce SSL connections, the PostgreSQL server will require clients to use SSL when connecting. This ensures that all data transmitted between the application and the database is encrypted, providing an additional layer of security for sensitive information.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are not directly related to enforcing SSL connections for the database:"

Encrypting the database using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key is a good practice for data-at-rest encryption, but it does not specifically enforce SSL connections for network communication between the application and the database.\n\nD. Patching the database with SSL/TLS by using a custom PostgreSQL extension is not the correct approach. SSL/TLS support is usually built into the PostgreSQL database, and you should not need to patch it with a custom extension for this purpose. Instead, you can enforce SSL connections through the custom parameter group."

The more memory you allocate, the more CPU power the function receives, leading to faster execution times.\n\nOption D (Load the required code into a custom layer) is unrelated to addressing the performance issues caused by CPU-intensive operations. Custom layers in AWS Lambda are used to share code libraries and dependencies among multiple functions. While it can be helpful for code reuse and organization, it won't directly resolve the CPU bottleneck issue."

The question states that the CloudWatch dashboard was previously created using the AWS Management Console, so there is no ID to reference the existing CloudWatch dashboard in the CloudFormation template.  You would need to export the existing CloudWatch dashboard as JSON, then use the DashboardBody property in the CloudFormation template to replicate it upon each deployment (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/CloudWatch-Dashboard-Body-Structure.html).

When a parent stack is deleted, CloudFormation will attempt to delete the nested stacks, but if there are any issues, the parent stack deletion will fail.\n\nE. Another possible cause of the DELETE_FAILED state is that there are Amazon S3 buckets that still contain objects in the stack. If there are objects (files) present in the S3 buckets that were created as part of the CloudFormation stack, the deletion of the stack will fail.

The burst credits allow the volume to burst above the baseline performance when needed but are limited in capacity. If the volume depletes its burst credits, the performance can decrease, resulting in slow response times.\n\nOn the other hand, gp3 is the next-generation general-purpose SSD EBS volume type that provides higher baseline performance, higher burst performance, and a new feature called \"provisioned IOPS\" that allows you to provision a consistent level of IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) independent of volume size.\n\nBy converting the gp2 volume to a gp3 volume, you will get higher baseline performance, which can help ensure consistently high performance for the database during periods of increased workload without relying solely on burst credits."

DiskReadBytes, DiskWriteBytes refer to instance store volumes (see, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html). Instance store volumes are physically attached disks and not EBS volumes (which are network attached drives). \n\nThus, the metrics we monitor look wrong to me.

These metrics are included in the AWS/EBS namespace (so it's definitely not D) by default and the CloudWatch agent is not required to monitor them.\n\nFinally, SSM agent is irrelevant in this case."

On the other hand, the custom DB subnet NACL needs to have new incoming/outgoing rules to also operate with the new public subnet.   Incoming is always going to be 3306 to the DB listener (MySQL).  Outgoing is always going to be ephemeral from the DB server to public subnet.  I must be slow or tired, but It took some effort for this to become clear in my mind tonight.  Your only allowing an existing subnet, and you don't want to touch any existing configurations or your going to create a new problem and maybe be looking for a new job.  I'd always document a checklist before doing something this, and run it through peer review and change control before touching prod.  I'd turn those notes into a SOP and include any references I could fine documenting AWS best practices, etc.  Enough said."

The network ACLs control the traffic flow in and out of the subnets. Here are the two actions you should take:\n\nA. On the default ACL, create inbound Allow rules of type TCP with the ephemeral port range and the source as the database subnets.\nExplanation: By allowing inbound TCP traffic with the ephemeral port range (usually ports 1024-65535) from the database subnets to the web subnets, you enable communication between the web tier and the database tier. The web servers use these ephemeral ports as source ports when connecting to the database on port 3306."

Outbound traffic to the ephemeral port must be allowed in the network ACL. For more information on modifying network ACL rules, see Add and delete rules.\n\nBy default, network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic.

This simplifies the solution and reduces development time.\n\nInput Transformer: The input transformer in the EventBridge rule allows you to convert the source data (CloudWatch alarm event) into the required JSON format for the ticketing system. This makes it easy to transform the data without the need for additional AWS Glue jobs or complex transformations."

Allocation strategies in EC2 Auto Scaling groups help you to provision your target capacity without the need to manually look for the Spot Instance pools with spare capacity. We recommend using the price-capacity-optimized strategy because this strategy automatically provisions instances from the most-available Spot Instance pools that also have the lowest possible price. Because your Spot Instance capacity is sourced from pools with optimal capacity, this decreases the possibility that your Spot Instances are interrupted.

To meet the requirement of having data no more than 24 hours old, you can promote the read replica to a standalone DB cluster within the desired time frame.

However, the question isn't clearly stating that.  The ALB needs to clearly be configured as the Origin.  The way they state the question is muddying up the distinction between \"Origin\" and \"Origin Access Identity\" which I distinguish as a setting in CloudFront.\n\nIn regards to \"D\", as I looked into it, the \"TTL\" of 0 (zero) only means the edge passes on every  request to the origin to see if the object has changed.  If not, then the object is not recent.  This setting would still impact the origin to some degree, but not anything like if they object were not being cashed at all.  Weighing that against the OAI presumably not being enabled (as in \"A\"), I see not having OAI not being enabled as far more of a problem as users can bypass CloudFront.  Now I'm back trying to figure out if \"A\" is really stating that, or just trying to make a confused statement as a trick response.\n\nAppreciate more informed thoughts on this from others."

In regards to \"D\", with TTL=0, every request for the object is passed on to the origin to see if the object has changed (or not).  That is going to cause unnecessary high utilization on the web server (even if new object is rarely forwarded).

If we talk about in terms of DNS records, we cannot add a CNAME record against the apex. We can map an IP address to the apex as an A record.\n \nSo, all we needed was a static IP address for our load balancer which we could map to our root domain and point it to the Load Balancer. The small issue was that Application Load Balancer does not have static IP addresses. So, I looked for methods to assign a static IP (elastic IP) address to the load balancer and found an AWS service named Global Accelerator which made it super-easy to assign static IP to the load balancer.\n \nRef link: https://kavishbaghel.com/how-to-point-domain-apex-to-an-application-load-balancer-88a7b82d19e9"

All other traffic should be directed to the secondary passive server. To achieve this, you need to create alias records for each server with evaluate target health set to yes, which means Route 53 will perform health checks on the targets associated with these records.\n\nChoosing an alias record is appropriate because alias records can be used to map the domain name to an Elastic Load Balancer, an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon CloudFront distribution, or another Route 53 resource record set. Alias records also support health checks.\n\nUsing an HTTP health check is suitable because you need to check the health of the servers based on HTTP responses. Route 53 will evaluate the HTTP status codes and determine which server is healthy to direct traffic to."

This can be done by specifying an Amazon EC2 action to stop the instances associated with the alarm.\n\nBy implementing this solution, the EC2 instances will be automatically stopped when their average CPU utilization falls below 5% for a continuous 30-minute period.

One thing we must understand is that AWS Organizations attaches an AWS managed SCP named FullAWSAccess to every root, OU and account when it's created. This policy allows all services and actions. Therefore, attaching a new SCP that denies all DynamoDB actions to the root of the organizations makes a lot more sense.

Log in to the EC2 instance.\n2. Use the appropriate file system commands (e.g., `resize2fs` for ext4, `xfs_growfs` for XFS) to extend the file system to utilize the additional space.\n\nThis is the least disruptive and quickest solution, as it does not require creating a snapshot, provisioning a new volume, or stopping the instance.

This method is useful for scaling as traffic changes occur, when you don't know when the traffic will change. You can configure scaling policies to respond for you. There are multiple policy types (or a combination of them) that you can use to scale in response to traffic changes.
