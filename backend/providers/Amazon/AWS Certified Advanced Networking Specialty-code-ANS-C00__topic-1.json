The cause is being able to communicate with the degraded server directly. Force the traffic via ELB.\nA - nope.\nB - secondary config, does not resolve issue.\nD - terminating still means the issue can reappear. If the ASG assigns a public IP to each instance, if I were to misconfigure websites for each of the 4 servers IPs, by-passing the ELB, I could get 4 degraded servers. D is wrong.\nAnswer is C.

Because load balancers intercept traffic between clients and servers, your server access logs contain only the IP address of the load balancer. To see the IP address of the client, use the X-Forwarded-For request header. Elastic Load Balancing stores the IP address of the client in the X-Forwarded-For request header and passes the header to your server. If the X-Forwarded-For request header is not included in the request, the load balancer creates one with the client IP address as the request value. Otherwise, the load balancer appends the client IP address to the existing header and passes the header to your server\nFor me, this parameter is available on ELB, so we simply can enable ELB Access logs and get it. So B can be chosen?"

Sever should NEVER, EVER, respond 403 because it's a CORS. \n403 means only one thing (if implemented correctly) - your credential is RIGHT, but you don't have permission, i.e. you are authenticated but NOT authorized. \nTo this question, as it clearly said the IAM role is correctly configured on this instance, so it's suggesting IAM machine linked role, and for this to work you would need metadata service to talk to STS and get temp token.

If you configure a S3 gateway VPC endpoint in the new VPC where the Windows instance is, it will add a more specific route to the S3 prefixes in the same region to the route table. This route will be more preferred so the traffic to S3 will be routed directly and privately via the S3 VPC endpoint. \nThe reason a 403 is being returned is because, when traffic is sent to a proxy, the traffic is source NAT'd to look like its originating from the proxy. Therefore the correct IAM instance role configured on the original Windows instance does not get used. The instance role of the proxy is used as it is the one initiating the connection to S3 on behalf of the Windows instance. There is no way one instance (the proxy) can initiate a request to S3 using the instance role of another instance (the Windows instance)."

This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IP addresses, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances serving malware or mining bitcoin. It also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized infrastructure deployments, like instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls, like a password policy change to reduce password strength."

Flow logs can help you with a number of tasks, such as troubleshooting why specific traffic is not reaching an instance, which in turn can help you diagnose overly restrictive security group rules. You can also use flow logs as a security tool to monitor the traffic that is reaching your instance, to profile your network traffic, and to look for abnormal traffic behaviors. A common use of VPC flow logs is to watch for abnormal and unexpected denied outbound connection requests, which could be an indication of a misconfigured or compromised EC2 instance. CloudWatch Alerts can provide rudimentary network alerting on VPC Flow Logs, however AWS APN members provide third-party log management systems that provide extensive reporting, visualization, and alerting capabilities based on VPC Flow Log data."

        "content": "Answer is B. My reasoning is as follows: There are three components to consider here: ELB, Application Instances, and Amazon RDS. Since company policy requires end-to-end encryption of all data in transit, ideally the encrypted data can go all the way to the database service (RDS) MySQL. However, that is not possible (otherwise this entire question becomes totally meaningless). Having the load balancer handle the SSL termination won't solve the problem as ELB cannot re-encrypt https traffic. As a result, we are only left with the application instances for SSL termination. With MySQL you can opt to connect to the database using an encrypted connection by configuring Amazon RDS for SSL, and use REQUIRE SSL grants. See https://www.laurencegellert.com/2017/08/how-to-require-ssl-when-connecting-to-mysql-on-aws-rds/"

Traffic leaving one router and returning on the other router. Remember the routers are not connected so they don't know about traffic leaving router 1 and returning on R2. Therefore, the answer can't be A. If you prepend R1 then R2 will receive incoming routes. A also says while advertising routes from R1. So A is saying R1 is advertising routes and R1 is also prepending. So traffic leaves R1 and returns on R2. This is creating the drop in traffic. To fix the problem you have to send traffic out R1 and receive traffic back on R1 for the stateful firewalls not to drop return traffic. B makes R1 primary on sending out traffic so D will also return traffic on R1. The problem is the answer could be BD or CE."

Clusters can contain multiple HSMs, spread across multiple Availability Zones in a region. HSMs in a cluster are automatically synchronized and load-balanced. You receive dedicated, single-tenant access to each HSM in your cluster. Each HSM appears as a network resource in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Adding and removing HSMs from your Cluster is a single call to the AWS CloudHSM API (or on the command line using the AWS CLI). After creating and initializing a CloudHSM Cluster, you can configure a client on your EC2 instance that allows your applications to use the cluster over a secure, authenticated network connection."

A load balancer can reduce the load on your individual web servers by balancing traffic across two or more servers.

You can use these headers to help validate that requests made to your origin were sent from CloudFront (shared secret) and configure your origin to only allow requests that contain the custom header values that you specify. This feature also helps with setting up Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) for your CloudFront distribution - you can configure CloudFront to always add custom headers to your origin to accommodate viewers that don't automatically include those headers in requests. It also allows you to disable varying on the Origin header, which improves your cache hit ratio, yet forward the appropriate headers so that your origin can respond with the CORS header. For more information, see Forwarding Custom Headers to Your Origin in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.\nCorrect Answer is B !"

CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required.

When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify. Log data is encrypted while in transit and while it is at rest.

Flow analysis techniques work exactly the same for both encrypted and unencrypted communications. This makes flow analysis a great method for threat hunting without the need for SSL/TLS interception and full-packet capture.\"\n\nTaking all of these into account, I will go with C because it will generate a ACCEPT/REJECT for layer 7 protocol (http, https, ssh etc)."

In this case B) works with Split-view DNS condition also satisfied.\n\n2)\tNow, if the on-premises subdomain dev.example.com is considered private and is expected to be resolved via outbound resolver endpoint (not mentioned in the question specifically), subdomain delegation will not be feasible. It has to work through resolver forward rules created in outbound endpoint. Hence, though not explained fully, will somewhat lean towards A) in this case, though Split-View DNS requirement in this case does not get addressed.\n\n\nIt'll all depend now whether the on-prem subdomain is considered a Public Hosted Zone (then option B) or a hybrid DNS setup with extension of Private Hosted Zone through Resolver Endpoint riles (then option A)."

You can manage the delivery channel to control where AWS Config sends configuration updates. You can have only one delivery channel per AWS account, and the delivery channel is required to use AWS Config. To change the delivery channel name, you must delete it and create a new delivery channel with the desired name. Before you can delete the delivery channel, you must temporarily stop the configuration recorder. The AWS Config console does not provide the option to delete the delivery channel, so you must use the AWS CLI, the AWS Config API, or one of the AWS SDKs.<br>Reference:<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/update-dc.html",

Then after your IP is changed with your EIP- then you must change the hostname (EC2 Instance name manually) - doable but very weird. However if the question meant changing public DNS name rather than saying hostname, Public DNS name changes automatically no need for manual intervention. Since there is no mention of DNS name on this can be True."

It is favored by applications where the data must be reliable, relevant, and complete, for example a news story. UDP is a connectionless protocol and cannot retransmit lost data packets. However, UDP is faster than TCP and is often used in applications like video conferencing and streaming where small transfer hiccups are barely noticeable. However, the most recent draft version of HTTP, HTTP/3, addresses some of the issues in TCP and UDP, combining features from two protocols: HTTP/2 and QUIC over UDP. HTTP/3 is also called HTTP-over-QUIC."

This results in less network chatter.\n\nLet\u2019s assume we need to transfer 20 gigabytes (21,474,836,480 bytes) of data as quickly as possible. With a standard 1500 byte MTU that will take 14,316,558 packets, but with an MTU of 9000 we are sending 2,386,093 packets. That\u2019s a difference of 11,930,465 packets.\nThat\u2019s our advantage.

Answer C is the same as Answer D but lacks BGP \u05d2\u20ac\" therefore we would need to setup the routes manually \u05d2\u20ac\" more time and effort.<br>Additionally Answer D uses Jumbo Frames \u05d2\u20ac\" but AWS does not support Jumbo frames over the Virtual Private Gateway \u05d2\u20ac\" therefore Answer D's use of Jumbo<br>Frames is negated.

In binary arithmetic, each bit within a group represents a power of two.<br>Specifically, the first bit in a group represents 2 to the power of 0, the second bit represents 2 to the power of 1, the third bit represents 2 to the power of 2, and so on. Binary format is simple because each successive bit in a group is exactly twice the value of the previous bit.<br>The first octet is 128 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 172<br>The second octet 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 123<br><br>The third octet 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 -<br>The fourth octet is 128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 157<br>Reference:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4",

The servers shuffle data internally and between themselves. Your company's financial performance is entirely dependent on the speed at which it can sort your customers datasets, that is the faster a sorted result can be returned the better your company's bottom line.<br>Of the choices presented below, select the optimal network configuration that will ensure the best financial results for your company.<br>",

If you cant find anything in Google then it probably does not exist - so no go.\nD. Overkill solution but technically it is accurate. 4x PVIFs = on-prem routing done. VPC Peering to all = mgmt can reach each VPC. Yes its overkill but I think this is the point of the question. Will the test taker go for the convulted option (A) or something the guy/gal has seen in some form already (D). D is the right option."
