By replicating your machines into a low-cost staging area while still being able to launch fully provisioned machines within minutes, CloudEndure Disaster Recovery can significantly reduce the cost of your disaster recovery infrastructure. The two key concepts when it comes to DR planning are Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). RTO is the maximum period you want your systems to be unavailable due to an outage. RPO refers to the point of data processing you wish to recover to if there is a disaster. The following diagram illustrates the correlation of RTO and RPO:"

This is because kernel version 7.45 and later supports the IMDSv2 protocol, while earlier versions only support IMDSv1. If the company applies the security enhancement before upgrading to kernel version 7.45 or later, it could result in an SAP outage or other issues."

For optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO), table preload can be turned on.\n\nFor disaster recovery (DR), you can use smaller instance types, since they are only used during actual disaster recovery and not for serving normal production load. If you are using system replication for DR, you can use ASYNC mode. The \"table preload\" option can be turned on to minimize RTO."

Since SAP's high-availability (HA) solution stipulates 2 or more cluster nodes (host machines) where the message server is enabled to run, you have to order as many license keys as you have cluster nodes.\n\nWhen we receive confirmation from your vendor that you are implementing a switchover environment, we provide the required license keys for your system, 1 key for each machine.\n\nSAP has implemented a license mechanism for transparent and easy use with switchover solutions and clustered environments. Your customer key is calculated on the basis of local information on the message server host. This is the host machine where the ABAP central services instance (ASCS instance) runs. There is no license problem when only the database is switched over."

SAP does not require separate licenses for each ASCS instance in each Availability Zone.\n\nThe licensing of SAP systems is based on the SAPS (SAP Application Performance Standard) capacity of the system and the number of users that will be accessing the system, not the number of instances or servers that the system is running on. Therefore, having separate ASCS instances in different Availability Zones for High Availability purposes should not require additional SAP licenses."

    "body": "A company has grown rapidly in a short period of time. This growth has led to an increase in the volume of data, the performance requirements for storage, and the memory and vCPU requirements for the company's SAP HANA database that runs on AWS. The SAP HANA database is a scale-up installation. Because of the increased requirements, the company plans to change the Amazon EC2 instance type to a virtual EC2 High Memory instance and plans to change the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume type to a higher performance volume type for the SAP HANA database.<br><br>The EC2 instance is a current-generation instance, both before and after the change. Additionally, the EC2 instance and the EBS volume meet all the prerequisites for instance type change and EBS volume type change. An SAP basis administrator must advise the company about whether these changes will require downtime for the SAP system.<br><br>Which guidance should the SAP basis administrator provide to the company?",

The new General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume can provide this configuration at a lower cost compared to Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) EBS volumes.

If the SAProuter configuration uses this public IP address, the connectivity will fail when the EC2 instance is restarted because the public IP address will have changed. However, an Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address, which remains associated with the EC2 instance even when it is stopped and restarted. Thus, by assigning an Elastic IP address to the EC2 instance and updating the SAProuter configuration with the Elastic IP address, the company can ensure that the SAP Support team will be able to establish connectivity with SAProuter whenever necessary."
