The AWS CAF focuses more on organizational readiness, governance, and best practices for adopting the AWS Cloud.\n\nB. Performance efficiency:\n\n    Performance efficiency is related to optimizing the performance of workloads in the cloud. While important, it's not specifically a foundational capability outlined in the AWS CAF. \n\nC. Governance:\n\n    Governance is a foundational capability in the AWS CAF. It involves establishing and enforcing policies and controls to manage and optimize cloud resources effectively. Governance in AWS CAF helps organizations maintain control, ensure compliance, and manage risks in their cloud environment.\n\nD. Reliability:\n\n    While reliability is crucial for cloud services, it's not explicitly mentioned as a foundational capability in the AWS CAF. However, reliability is often addressed as part of best practices and operational considerations when adopting the AWS Cloud."

Only Code Build, which wouldn't do it,   If this is on an exam and Code Deploy is there instead of Code Build. I would have selected code deploy.

By breaking down the monolithic application into smaller, independent services with well-defined APIs, the company is aiming to reduce dependencies between services, making them easier to develop, deploy, and scale independently. This aligns perfectly with the goal of improving scalability and maintainability, which are key challenges with the current monolithic application."

Implement loosely coupled dependencies: The best practice of implementing loosely coupled dependencies aligns with the company's plan to migrate the monolithic on-premises application to AWS and divide it into microservices. Microservices architecture emphasizes the use of loosely coupled, independently deployable components that can be developed and maintained separately. Implementing loosely coupled dependencies, promotes the decoupling of services, allowing for greater agility, scalability, and ease of maintenance in a microservices architecture.\n\nThe other options are not as directly related to the described scenario:\n\n    Option A is related to testing practices.\n    Option B focuses on automation in deployment.\n    Option C refers to deploying the application to multiple locations, which may be a part of a broader strategy but is not specifically addressing the benefits of microservices architecture."

MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors (typically something they know, like a password, and something they have, like a temporary MFA code from a hardware token or mobile app) before gaining access. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if login credentials are compromised."

In other words, as a company produces more units of a good or service, its average cost of production per unit decreases. This cost reduction occurs because fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units, leading to increased operational efficiency and cost efficiency.\n\nA. The ability to trade variable expense for fixed expense: Cloud computing, in general, provides the advantage of paying for resources on a variable (pay-as-you-go) basis rather than a fixed, upfront expense.\n\nB. Increased speed and agility: While increased speed and agility are benefits of cloud computing, they are not specifically related to the economies of scale. \n\nC. Lower variable costs over fixed costs: This is a key benefit of economies of scale. With cloud computing, as usage increases, the cost per unit of resources tends to decrease due to the efficiency gained from large-scale operations.\n\nD. Increased operational costs across data centers: Increased operational costs across data centers would be contrary to the benefits of economies of scale."

AWS Cloud Formation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.

One bill for multiple accounts: This simplifies cost management by providing a single, consolidated view of all charges across all accounts within your AWS Organization. This makes it easier to track spending, identify cost anomalies, and optimize resource utilization.\n\nE. Custom cost and usage budget creation: Consolidated billing lets you set flexible budgets for individual accounts or groups of accounts within your organization. This allows you to control spending and prevent unexpected surges in costs. You can also set alerts to notify you when budgets are nearing or exceeding their limits."

Grant the developer access to only the AWS resources needed to perform the job: Following the principle of least privilege, it is advisable to provide the developer with access only to the specific AWS resources necessary for their job role. This minimizes the potential impact of security incidents and limits the scope of actions the developer can perform.\n\nE. Ensure the account password policy requires a minimum length: Implementing a password policy that requires a minimum length is a good security practice. It helps enhance the strength of passwords and contributes to better overall account security. Longer passwords are generally more resistant to brute-force attacks.\n\nOptions B and C and D are not recommended"

With consolidated billing, each department can have its own AWS account for tracking and managing its resources separately, while the company enjoys the convenience of a single payment method for all these accounts. This setup makes it easier to track costs and implement chargeback mechanisms.\nE. Multiple AWS Accounts\n\nCreating multiple AWS accounts, one for each department, is an effective way to segregate resources, manage permissions, and track costs separately. This approach enhances security by limiting the scope of access and impact of changes, and it simplifies the process of attributing costs to the right department. Combined with consolidated billing, it provides both organizational flexibility and centralized financial control."

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS): Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables asynchronous communication between distributed components of an application. By decoupling the components of your system, SQS helps ensure that different parts of your architecture can operate independently and communicate without being directly connected. This decoupling allows for greater scalability and fault tolerance.\n\nE. AWS Step Functions: AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that enables you to coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. It allows you to build and manage workflows that integrate different services, and each step in the workflow can be independently developed and scaled. This service helps in creating loosely coupled components by managing the sequence of service calls and ensuring that each component performs its task independently."

Spot Instances allow users to bid on unused EC2 capacity, often resulting in significantly lower prices compared to On-Demand or Reserved Instances. Since the workload in this scenario is experimental and can be stopped after 12 hours, leveraging Spot Instances enables the company to take advantage of cost savings without compromising performance or reliability. Additionally, Spot Instances can be terminated with a two-minute notification, which aligns well with the requirement to stop the instance after a specific duration.

Create an IAM user with administrator privileges for daily administrative tasks, instead of using the root user.\nIt's recommended to create an IAM user with the necessary permissions for daily administrative tasks rather than using the root user. This practice helps in maintaining better security and accountability by reducing the reliance on the highly privileged root user account.\n\nSo, the correct options are C and D"

The ability to provision and deprovision resources quickly with minimal effort\n\nThe agility provided by AWS is closely tied to the ability to provision and deprovision resources rapidly. AWS allows users to scale their infrastructure up or down based on demand, enabling them to quickly deploy new resources when needed and release them when no longer necessary. This flexibility and speed in resource management contribute to operational agility, allowing companies to respond more efficiently to changing business requirements."

This makes it a cost-effective solution for storing data that is accessed less frequently but still needs to be accessible within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nWhy not B?\nS3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (option B) is not the most suitable option for the given scenario because it's designed for long-term archival storage with infrequent access. While it does offer a low storage cost, retrieving data from Glacier typically takes longer than 12 hours because Glacier is optimized for long-term storage at a lower cost with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours, depending on the retrieval option chosen."

Amazon Aurora Serverless.\n\nAmazon Aurora Serverless is a fully managed relational database service that automatically scales compute capacity up or down based on the application's needs. It is ideal for workloads with unpredictable or intermittent usage patterns, as it automatically starts and stops database instances based on demand. This means the company doesn't need to provision or manage the database instance themselves, resulting in minimal management overhead. Additionally, Aurora Serverless offers the benefits of Aurora's high performance and durability, making it a suitable choice for migrating the PostgreSQL database with minimal management effort."

In Amazon RDS, a deployed database server is not scaled to a larger instance type unless its configuration is explicitly updated to a different size, which can result in up to five minutes of downtime. RDS does offer auto scaling for read replicas, but the process takes a few minutes to execute since it has to deploy additional RDS instances. Aurora Serverless' automatic scaling results in much faster deployment times, typically within 30 seconds."

This means that the application is still subject to regional outages, which can affect users in that region. Additionally, latency to users in other regions may still be high."

You can configure rules in security groups to allow only the minimum required network traffic, such as allowing traffic from specific IP address ranges or specific protocols like HTTPS2. If you need to control network traffic between certain EC2 instances, security groups are the appropriate choice."

For example, you might replatform a Microsoft SQL Server database to Amazon RDS for SQL Server.\n\nUsing this strategy, you might make a few or many changes to the application, depending on your business goals and your target platform.\n\nThe following are common use cases for the replatform migration strategy:\n\nYou want to save time and reduce cost by moving to a fully managed service or serverless service in the AWS Cloud."

Its purpose is to optimize compute-heavy tasks by providing a fast file system that can process large-scale data, not to serve as a storage gateway solution for seamlessly storing and retrieving data from S3 via NFS.\n\nThe correct answer was C. AWS Storage Gateway file gateway, because AWS Storage Gateway file gateway is specifically designed to allow companies to use NFS (or SMB) protocols to store and retrieve data directly in S3. It acts as a bridge between on-premises environments and Amazon S3, enabling easy integration for businesses that want to store their files as objects in S3."
