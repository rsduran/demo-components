        "content": "The code x = '\\\\\\' is not erroneous. This is a valid Python string assignment. In Python, the backslash (\\) is an escape character.\n\nHere's how it works in this case:\n\nThe first backslash escapes the second backslash, resulting in a single backslash character.\nThe third backslash is not followed by any special character, so it remains as a backslash.\nTherefore, the string x actually contains two backslashes: '\\\\'.\n\nSo, the length of the string x is 2.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2"
