The system will flow 156 pounds of carbon dioxide per minute, and the enclosure strength has been calculated to be 9 lb/ft2 (71 kg). What is the minimum vent size recommended for this application?",

        "content": "To calculate the minimum vent size, we need to consider the flow rate of carbon dioxide and the strength of the enclosure.\n\nFirst, let's convert the enclosure strength from pounds per square foot (lb/ft\u00b2) to pounds per minute (lb/min) to match the flow rate of carbon dioxide.\n\n9 lb/ft\u00b2 * (156 lb/min) = 1404 lb/min\n\nNow, we compare the flow rate of carbon dioxide (156 lb/min) to the strength of the enclosure (1404 lb/min). The higher value, which is 1404 lb/min, represents the required vent size.\n\nNow, we convert this value to square inches:\n1404 lb/min \u00f7 30 in/min (since 1 lb/min equals about 30 in\u00b2 of vent area) \u2248 47 in\u00b2\n\nSo, the minimum vent size recommended for this application would be closest to option:\n\nC. 45 in\u00b2 (290 cm\u00b2)"
