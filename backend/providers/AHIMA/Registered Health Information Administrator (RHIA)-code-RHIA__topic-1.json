Pharmacists play a crucial role in monitoring the patient's medication regimen, assessing the effectiveness of the drugs, and checking for potential drug interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, in acute care settings, such as hospitals, the focus is more on immediate care and treatment of a severe injury or episode of illness, an urgent medical condition, or during recovery from surgery. While medications are certainly used in acute care settings, the need for a formal pharmacy consultation is less common."

Also, since the vomiting and diarrhea was present on admission, why would you not code for it because he was also treated for it. There is a confirmed dx of food poisoning, why wouldn't that code be included as well. I would think that the answered would-be D, but it does not say anything about the child asthma. Therefore, that is the reason why I think that this question is not complete. But based on the other dx(s) that should be included is the reason why I assumed that the answer should be D.
