A credit memo created from a return authorization has no impact on inventory, however, a stand-alone credit memo does impact inventory.\n\nWhen a credit memo is created from a return authorization, the inventory item that was returned is already removed from the inventory. Therefore, the credit memo does not affect the inventory quantity since the inventory quantity has already been reduced when the item was returned.\n\nOn the other hand, when a stand-alone credit memo is created without a return authorization, it means that the customer is receiving a credit without returning any items. In this case, the inventory quantity is not reduced because the customer is not returning any items, but the value of the inventory may be impacted by the credit memo."
