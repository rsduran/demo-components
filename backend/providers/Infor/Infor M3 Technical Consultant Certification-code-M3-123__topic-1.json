Facilities can contain multiple warehouses. \nItem Warehouse: An item warehouse is a specific storage entity within a facility where items are kept. Each warehouse can have its own inventory accounting methods and acquisition codes, which dictate how the costs and inventory levels are managed.\nItem Location: An item location refers to the specific physical or logical place within a warehouse where an item is stored. Each location can have different statuses indicating its availability (e.g., available, under inspection, or rejected) and is  essential for tracking stock and managing inventory effectively."
