In this case, you can point the replication copy job to this backup. During the first session of the replication job, Veeam Backup &amp; Replication will use this backup file as a \"seed\". Veeam Backup &amp; Replication will restore the VM image from the backup and register the VM replica on the target host. After that, Veeam Backup &amp; Replication will synchronize the VM replica with the source VM. All subsequent incremental replication runs will be performed in the regular manner."
