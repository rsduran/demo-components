This can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred over the network, making efficient use of the available bandwidth.\nBy using both traffic throttling and WAN acceleration together, you can achieve the desired RPO of six hours while minimizing the impact on the network and effectively utilizing the available bandwidth.\nUsing backup copy jobs with traffic throttling and enabling WAN acceleration will help ensure that the off-site backups can be performed within the required RPO while efficiently utilizing the available bandwidth for data transfer."

There are 2 retention periods referenced in this question, dailies are set to 31 days whereas a weekly GFS full backup are kept for 14 weeks. Since the question is asking for a backup that occurred during the week of Jan 1st, not specifying a specific date, then in theory that weekly GFS (with a retention of 14 weeks) meets that criteria and would be stored on the performance tier, right? However, the settings for this SOBR are set to \"move\" backups older than 21 days - so with that in mind, it's been well over that amount of days (Jan 1st to Mar 20th), meaning the weekly GFS restore points from that month of Jan were moved to the capacity tier."
