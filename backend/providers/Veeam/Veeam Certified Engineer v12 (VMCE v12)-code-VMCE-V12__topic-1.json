Since the VMware backup job retention is set for 31 days and keeps weekly GFS full backups for 14 weeks, the backup from the week of January 1st is older than 21 days but within the 14-week GFS retention policy. Therefore, as of March 20, the backup data you need to recover would be in the capacity tier, not on the local performance tier, because it has been offloaded to the object storage\nconfigured as the capacity tier to reduce long-term retention costs.\n\nReference: Veeam Backup &amp; Replication Documentation, Scale-Out Backup Repository Configuration"

By deploying these components on a dedicated backup network, you can isolate backup traffic from the main production network, reducing potential congestion and increasing the overall performance of the backup job.\n\nOptions A and C do not directly address network performance concerns. Option B, assigning a high priority to the job, may help in certain cases, but it won't necessarily address network performance issues.

After these backups are stored on a disk-based repository, you can then create backup to tape jobs. This method leverages Veeam's ability to handle both types of environments and ensures that all data is efficiently backed up to tape for offsite storage and ransomware protection."
