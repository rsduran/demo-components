Their characteristic is a continuous signal\nwith a high duty cycle across the entire affected band. They may operate in 2.4GHz\nor 5GHz. The presence of a jammer signal is reflective of an attack against your network. Many jammers operate in the 2.4GHz band because this band is categorized as\nIndustrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) and can be used by any transmitter (under\nsome relaxed regulatory conditions). Most of the 5GHz band is not ISM, which makes\nit less susceptible to interferences from non-802.11 devices. However, different countries have different rules, and you may see in non-ISM 5GHz channels devices that\nwere designed for a country where such operation is allowed."

These perimeter access points play a vital role to ensure good location fidelity within the areas they encircle, and, in some cases, can provide general voice or data coverage, as well."

This management must allow subnets to be assigned consistently with the physical location of users within the organization.\n\nThe correct choice, D. Interface groups, directly focuses on the administration of subnets and their logical assignment within a larger network, which is the primary goal in this scenario. Interface groups allow for the grouping of multiple network interfaces on the controller, where each group can be associated with a different subnet. This makes it much easier to assign specific subnets to users in different locations, ensuring that the network structure is organized and that access and security policies are appropriately applied based on where the user is connecting."

Now consider a scenario where 25 users are associated to each AP. That would result in 2500 users who share a single VLAN. Some customer designs can require substantially smaller subnet sizes. One way to deal with this is to break up the WLAN into multiple segments. The AP grouping feature of the WLC allows a single WLAN to be supported across multiple dynamic interfaces (VLANs) on the controller. This is done when a group of APs is mapped to a specific dynamic interface. APs can be grouped logically by employee workgroup or physically by location. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-vlan/71477-ap-group-vlans-wlc.html"

This is particularly important in an outdoor setting like a sports complex, where there might be other sources of interference.\n\n14-dBi Patch Antenna: A patch antenna with a high gain (14 dBi) is directional and focuses the signal in a specific direction, which is ideal for backhaul links where the signal needs to travel a longer distance from the RAP to other access points in the network. The directional nature of the patch antenna helps in maintaining a strong and focused signal, increasing the link's reliability and performance."

The Cisco AP1130 Series provides the same type of antenna design concept. For voice, a ceiling-mounted antenna is preferred over a wall-mounted patch because the human head and body attenuate 5 dB of the signal (see Figure 11-1). Most floors attenuate 7 dB of the signal.\nFor phones that have the antenna inside the body of the phone, the way the phone is held in the human hand can influence signal attenuation by 4 dB. In some cases, a phone held against the head with the hand covering the antenna can result in a signal drop of 9 dB. The general rule for indoor deployments is that every 9 dB of signal loss reduces the coverage area in half. Figure 11-1 shows an example of the difference in radiating power from a handset when held to the head.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/Voice.html"

AP cells should be overlapped by about 20 percent to streamline client roaming and handoff from one AP to another. Any delay or interruption will be very noticeable to users on an active call, so devices should be able to find candidate APs well ahead of time as the users move around. As the previous sections recommended, the RSSI of each AP should be \u221267 dBm or higher at the boundary of its cell, and the SNR should be 25 dB or greater. When you perform an active site survey to validate the network\u2019s performance, packet loss or the packet error rate (PER) should be no greater than about 1 percent.'"

Besides, high wireless clients concentration demand needs to have a high SNR and to avoid Co-Channel interference. I quote: \"One of the hallmarks of a high-performing WLAN is channel reuse. This is the practice of deploying channels in such a manner that they limit the amount if CCI introduced into the environment. The best way to achieve this is by having as many channels to deploy as possible. While a 20MHz channel will not achieve the higher data rates that are advertised with 80MHz, clients can still reach acceptable speeds, allowing you to optimally use each bit of available airtime.\" https://www.ekahau.com/blog/channel-planning-best-practices-for-better-wi-fi/"

Alternatively, a fast roaming handoff will improve the wireless experience. A tricky one from Cisco, but I think the best choice here is B."

There are only 7 Critical priority APs. In theory when fail-over occurs the WLC should disassociate the AP's that are a lower priority if it detects that higher priority APs are trying to associate. With 10 licenses that would give enough room for the 7 Critical and 3 High AP count. In order for the WLC to adhere to the AP priority functionality, you need to enter the \"network ap-priority enable\" command. Otherwise, it does not care what priorities are assigned. So this could only mean that the command is currently in its disabled state as its not \"making room\" for the critical priority APs."

The Redundancy Port is also used in order to check peer reachability sending UDP keep-alive messages every 100 msec (default timer) from the Standby WLC to the Active WLC. Also, in the event of a box failure, the Active WLC will send notification to the Standby WLC via the Redundant Port. If the NTP server is not configured, a manual time sync is performed from the Active WLC to the Standby WLC on the Redundant Port. This port in case of standalone controller and redundancy VLAN in case of WISM-2 will be assigned an auto generated IP Address where last 2 octets are picked from the last 2 octets of Redundancy Management Interface (the first 2 octets are always 169.254)."

MIC alone might not be sufficient for the high-security requirements of a government agency.\n\nMobility Group Names: Using a different group name for each mobility member or a complex group name can help with organizational clarity and might add a layer of security through obscurity.

A minimum of three APs should be able to receive a client\u2019s signal, while four or more APs are preferred. You should think of every possible client location having at least one AP in each surrounding quadrant.\n\nTo derive a fairly accurate location, multiple APs must receive the client device or tag at an RSSI above a minimum signal level of \u201375 dBm. When you perform a site survey, you should use a threshold of \u201372 dBm, which will give a 3 dB buffer over the absolute minimum."

The foreign controller load balances guest clients across the list of anchor controllers: Upgrading to version 8.10 or later provides the ability for the foreign controller to distribute guest clients across multiple anchor controllers. This helps to optimize network resources and ensures better performance and reliability by preventing any single anchor controller from becoming a bottleneck.\nPrimary and Secondary Anchor Designation:\n\nE. The foreign controller designates one anchor as primary and one or more anchors as secondary: With the newer code, the foreign controller can designate a primary anchor controller and one or more secondary anchor controllers. This provides redundancy and ensures that if the primary anchor controller fails, the secondary controllers can take over, thus maintaining service availability for guest clients."

Set the XOR radio role to Sniffer mode and the slot 1 radio to Client Serving on all the APs.\n\nThis setup allows the APs to monitor both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands for rogue APs while continuing to serve client devices on the 5 GHz band, ensuring that existing client connectivity is not impacted."
