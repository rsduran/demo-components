Here is a extract of OnDemand Learning Center:\n\n\"Hybrid Call Services include two components, Call Service Aware and Call Service Connect.\nCall Service Aware makes Cisco Spark aware of all calls across your Unified Communications (UC) system, thus enabling the automatic creation of a one-to-one room whenever a point-to-point call is placed between two Spark users on their on-premises registered endpoints. This one-to-one room provides capabilities such as Zero Touch Meetings, which allow simple screen sharing between the two users. Call Service Aware also provides a unified call history; the Spark client shows missed and placed calls even if the client was not running at the time the call occurred.\""
