    "answer": "D",
    "answerDescription": "NAT operation is typically transparent to both the internal and external hosts. Typically the internal host is aware of the true IP address and TCP or UDP port of the external host. Typically the NAT device may function as the default gateway for the internal host. However the external host is only aware of the public IP address for the NAT device and the particular port being used to communicate on behalf of a specific internal host.<br><br>NAT and TCP/UDP -<br>\"Pure NAT\", operating on IP alone, may or may not correctly parse protocols that are totally concerned with IP information, such as ICMP, depending on whether the payload is interpreted by a host on the \"inside\" or \"outside\" of translation. As soon as the protocol stack is traversed, even with such basic protocols as TCP and UDP, the protocols will break unless NAT takes action beyond the network layer. IP packets have a checksum in each packet header, which provides error detection only for the header. IP datagrams may become fragmented and it is necessary for a NAT to reassemble these fragments to allow correct recalculation of higher-level checksums and correct tracking of which packets belong to which connection. The major transport layer protocols, TCP and UDP, have a checksum that covers all the data they carry, as well as the TCP/UDP header, plus a \"pseudo-header\" that contains the source and destination IP addresses of the packet carrying the TCP/UDP header. For an originating NAT to pass TCP or UDP successfully, it must recompute the TCP/UDP header checksum based on the translated IP addresses, not the original ones, and put that checksum into the TCP/UDP header of the first packet of the fragmented set of packets. The receiving<br>NAT must recompute the IP checksum on every packet it passes to the destination host, and also recognize and recompute the TCP/UDP header using the retranslated addresses and pseudo-header. This is not a completely solved problem. One solution is for the receiving NAT to reassemble the entire segment and then recompute a checksum calculated across all packets.<br>The originating host may perform Maximum transmission unit (MTU) path discovery to determine the packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation, and then set the don't fragment (DF) bit in the appropriate packet header field. Of course, this is only a one- way solution, because the responding host can send packets of any size, which may be fragmented before reaching the NAT.",

        "content": "The correct answer is B. When traffic that originates outside the network must be routed to internal hosts.\n\nOne-way NAT (Network Address Translation) is used to translate the source IP address of packets that originate from a private IP address space to a public IP address when the packets go out to the internet. It is called one-way NAT because it only translates the source IP address and not the destination IP address.\n\nIn this scenario, one-way NAT is required when traffic from outside the network needs to access internal hosts. This is because the internal hosts have private IP addresses that cannot be reached from the internet. By using one-way NAT, the source IP address of the packets from the internal hosts is translated to a public IP address before it is sent to the internet. When the response packets come back from the internet, they are sent to the public IP address, which is then translated back to the private IP address of the internal host."

Say the sender device is sending segments and the receiver device can accommodate only a fixed number of segments before it can accept more, the two devices negotiate the window size during the connection setup.<br>This is done so that the sending device doesn't overflow the receiving device's buffer. Also the receiving device can send a single acknowledgement for the segments it has received instead of sending an acknowledgement after every segment received. Also, this window size is dynamic meaning, the devices can negotiate and change the window size in the middle of a session. So if initially the window size is three and the receiving device thinks that it can accept more number of segments in its buffer it can negotiate with the sending device and it increase it to say 5 for example. Windowing is used only by TCP since UDP doesn't use or allow flow control.",

CEF cheats a little, by building a Forwarding Information Base (FIB), and an adjacency table.  The FIB is accessed very quickly based on how they built it (it is Cisco proprietary), and contains pre-computed reverse lookups, next hop information for routes including the interface and L2 information to use.  (All the stuff a router would have to consider when forwarding a packet)."

This way, when another packet going to the same destination is seen, the next hop information can be re-used from the cache, so the processor doesn\u2019t have to look up and assemble all the information again.  If the information is not cached, (for example a first packet for a given destination network) the CPU will have a similar workload, for that packet, as if fast switching was not in use."
