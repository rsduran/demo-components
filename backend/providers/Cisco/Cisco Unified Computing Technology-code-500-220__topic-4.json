You\u00b4ll find these information at Meraki\u00b4s documentation, in two separate articles:\n\nAnswer A:\nOverview\nThe Meraki Dashboard allows Administrators to configure a combination of Network and Device specific tags to create Summary Reports filtered for specific devices across multiple networks. This allows for the easy creation of much more specific Summary Reports than creating reports based on entire Networks\nRef.: https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Organizations_and_Networks/Organization_Menu/Manage_Tags\n\nAnswer C:\nPermissions by Network Tag\nTo simplify the assignment of network-level permissions in an organization with many networks, permissions can be granted to users for a given network tag. Those permissions will then be applied to all networks in an organization with that tag. These changes can only be made by users with full organization access.\nRef.: https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Managing_Dashboard_Access/Managing_Dashboard_Administrators_and_Permissions"
