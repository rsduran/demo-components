A role defines the privileges of a user in the system and the locale defines the organizations (domains) that a user is allowed access. Because users are not directly assigned privileges, management of individual user privileges is simply a matter of assigning the appropriate roles and locales.\n\nA user is granted write access to desired system resources only if the assigned role grants the access privileges and the assigned locale allows access. For example, a user with the Server Administrator role in the Engineering organization could update server configurations in the Engineering organization but could not update server configurations in the Finance organization unless the locales assigned to the user include the Finance organization.\nRef:https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/sw/gui/config/guide/1-4/UCSM_GUI_Configuration_Guide_1_4_chapter9.html"

It provides separation on the management and data planes.\nOut-of-Band Management Interface\nOut-of-band refers to an interface that allows only management protocol traffic to be forwarded or processed. An out-of-band management interface is defined by the network operator to specifically receive network management traffic. The advantage is that forwarding (or customer) traffic cannot interfere with the management of the router, which significantly reduces the possibility of denial-of-service attacks.\nREf:https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/crs/software/crs_r4-1/security/configuration/guide/syssec_cg41crs_chapter7.html"

It is arguably the most important statement to understand. It defines a single value of a particular type and it contains no children. It would be things like the IP address of an interface, the subnet mask of an interface, and so on.\n\nAs you can see, nested under each leaf are additional parameters (attributes) that are used to describe and provide constraints of the leaf. You can declare things to be mandatory, for example. You will also see here that it has a \u2018config true\u2019 which means that it is configuration data so it will be sent back on a \u2018get config\u2019 while the second leaf here, cpu-temperature, obviously it is not something that you would change using a client and something that is read-only. So that is config\u00bb false\u2019."
