This allows performance analysts and developers to drill down into individual transactions to diagnose performance bottlenecks, errors, or anomalies.\n\nNote: A Business Transaction -is- an instance in and of itself.\n\nReference: AppDynamics documentation on Transaction Snapshots: Offers detailed guidance on how to capture and analyze transaction snapshots to troubleshoot and optimize application performance."
