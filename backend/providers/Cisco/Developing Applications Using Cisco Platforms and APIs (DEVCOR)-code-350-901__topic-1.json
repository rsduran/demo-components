Passive means that cluster doesn\u2019t process the client\u2019s requests, but contains the configuration, application, and data.\nSo it looks as A/A and A/P have same RTO, but one differencies - A/P does not proccess client request.

Set a per-user limit (for example, 5 requests/minute/user) and deny the requests from the users who have reached the limit.\n\tThis would be a case of Token Bucket, but Question does not mention the amount of users per second, so whatever we can think of here may not avoid hitting the platform below 1000 requests/second\n\t\n    C. Only 1000 user connections are allowed; further connections are denied so that all connected users can be served.\n\tIt looks to me a case of Sliding Window since it says the platform supports up to 1000 requests/second. That means when the app receives a new request it must check how many have been made in the last second; if 1000 have already been mande the new request should be rejected.  \n\t\n    D. All requests are saved and processed one by one so that all users can be served eventually.\n\tSimilar to option \"B\" question does not mention that we have resources to queue requests.. This would be a case of Leaky Bucket where you also need to specify the capacity for queing requests."

For example, we can limit the number of requests per user to be no more than 100 per second."

Create a Dockerfile for the code base.\n\nExplanation: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) uses Docker as its container runtime, and hence, in order to make your JavaScript module ready to deploy on GKE, you need to create a Dockerfile. This Dockerfile will include instructions on how to build a Docker image of your application, which can then be deployed on GKE.\n\nThe other options are not mandatory:\n\nB. Rewriting the code in Python is not necessary if the original code is already in JavaScript. Kubernetes can run any language as long as it's packaged inside a Docker container.\n\nC. The process of \"containerizing\" is indeed necessary, but it's achieved through the creation of a Dockerfile (option A), not through building a \"wrapper\" for the code.\n\nD.

It's not a mandatory step to make the code ready for deployment to GKE."

ACID is especially concerned with how a database recovers from any failure that might occur while processing a transaction. An ACID-compliant DBMS ensures that the data in the database remains accurate and consistent despite any such failures. All of the major relational DBMSs adhere to the ACID principles. They all include features that ensure that the data maintains consistent throughout software and hardware crashes, as well as any failed transactions."

This is in distinction to vertically scaled systems, where adding capacity and throughput generally involves replacing smaller nodes with larger and more powerful ones. Nevertheless, horizontal scalability brings a new problem, if you have 10 service doing the same job, which one to connect, to put simply how to distribute the traffic? Solution to this, of course, distributing incoming traffic to the pool of resources or servers by load balancing.\n\nIn distributed load balancing, there are no central load balancers, each client that requires some service uses that service via locally installed reverse-proxy. Reverse-proxy is always up-to-date with existing services, meaning when a new service is being provisioned, reverse-proxy is configuration and it is updated. Reverse-proxy, take cares of the load-balancing, so it is a client-side load-balancing. Every time, a client makes a request, based on the load-balancing strategy, reverse-proxy, distributes the request to the attached resources."

In other words, with pseudonymization, some unique ID is still present, but it\u2019s not personally identifiable. Pseudonymization is less secure, as it allows re-identification either as a result of some authority\u2019s request or due to advanced analytics (for example, from knowing that the same person went to certain places, it is possible to deduce who he/she is)."

You define the structure using protocol buffer message types in .proto files. Each protocol buffer message is a small logical record of information, containing a series of name-value pairs.\nCisco gRPC IDL uses the protocol buffers interface definition language (IDL) to define service methods, and define parameters and return types as protocol buffer message types. The gRPC requests are encoded and sent to the router using JSON. Clients can invoke the RPC calls defined in the IDL to program the router."

This can be either HTTP or HTTPS depending on the specific needs of the network and application, although using HTTP is more common after termination because the load balancer has already decrypted the traffic and can then send it unencrypted to the server in a secure network.\n\nGiven these considerations, the two correct options are:\n\nC.

Where the reset command moves the branch pointer back in the chain (typically) to \"undo\" changes, the revert command adds a new commit at the end of the chain to \"cancel\" changes. The effect is most easily seen by looking at Figure 1 again. If we add a line to a file in each commit in the chain, one way to get back to the version with only two lines is to reset to that commit, i.e., git reset HEAD~1."

Use exponential backoff when retrying distributed services and other remote endpoints.\n\nExponential backoff is a common strategy for handling temporary errors like HTTP 403 (Forbidden). It involves progressively increasing the time between retries when a request encounters an error, which helps to avoid overloading the server and gives it some time to recover. This approach is more efficient and considerate than the other options listed."

You have to build in error handling to gracefully inform the user they just don't have permission to access the resource, and let them choose where to go from there.

The management interface is used by the switch to \"manage\" the docker container (eg. starting and operating a shell). This interface isn't running as a 'service interface' (such as \"eth0\") inside the docker container, it's bound to the whole container.  You can see the 2 available configurations on page 84 of the original CiscoLive presentation of docker container configuration on a catalyst switch:\nhttps://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/us/docs/2019/pdf/BRKCRS-2004.pdf"

Subinterface: Subinterfaces can be used when you need to divide a physical interface into multiple logical interfaces.

Note that this does not mean that they are executed on different CPUs. Python threads are used in cases where the execution of a task involves some waiting. One example would be interaction with a service hosted on another computer, such as a webserver. Threading allows python to execute other code while waiting; this is easily simulated with the sleep function.\n\nimport time\nimport threading\n\ndef myfunc(name):\n    print(f'myfunc started with {name}')\n    time.sleep(10)\n    print('myfunc ended')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print('main started')\n    thread = threading.Thread(target=myfunc,args=['realpython'])\n    thread.start()\n    print('main ended')\n\nhttps://realpython.com/lessons/two-threads/"

For example, replacing the &lt; character with &amp;lt; or &amp;#60; for the web content would disable all HTML tags. In Python, this can be done with the standard html.escape() and html.unescape() functions. Sometimes some HTML tags are acceptable, so escaping them all is not an option. In this case, sanitization is a suitable solution. Sanitization processes untrusted user input and runs it through the filter, which allows valid content but strips anything that is not permitted. For example, it may allow &lt;A&gt;, &lt;IMG&gt;, &lt;B&gt; HTML tags but strip any other tags.\""

Essentially, it\u2019s a unique value that can be added to the end of the password to create a different hash value. This adds a layer of security to the hashing process, specifically against brute force attacks. A brute force attack is where a computer or botnet attempt every possible combination of letters and numbers until the password is found.\n\nAnyway, when salting, the additional value is referred to as a \u201csalt.\u201d\n\nThe idea is that by adding a salt to the end of a password and then hashing it, you\u2019ve essentially complicated the password cracking process.\nhttps://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-encryption-hashing-salting/"

In network devices, we can spread which logs will be processed locally and which ones will not. I'm not sure if this could be easily applied to the code. \nC. provides flexibility due to a wide range of plugins and accepted log formats - It is correct since we can use the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack.\n D. enables extension of logs with fields and export to backend systems - Incorrect \n E. buffers and resends data when the network is unavailable - We can establish a limit for network devices to buffer their logs and discard them if this limit is reached, but I'm not sure if this could be applied here."

At 13 min the video goes into detail regarding the multiple tunnels between the VGW and the transit VPC providing high availability and access to multiple VPC networks. The network that B is referring to is the VPC that has the VGW. The VGW initiates the dual connections to the transit VPC CSRs and hence provides high availability to its VPC. As the dual connections could be IPSec as per the video perhaps D is also correct. Does anyone have a definitive answer if you watch the entire video?"

Using a privacy-enhanced mail (PEM) certificate to create bundles is popular due to the simple text format of those certificates. To create a PEM certificate bundle, it is enough to copy each certificate in the opposite issuing order in a text file, typically assigning a .pem extension.\n\nTo create a PEM certificate bundle, copy certificates in reverse order, omitting the final SSL certificate:\nRoot.crt is the root certificate\nIntermediate1.crt is the intermediate certificate 1\nIntermediate2.crt is the intermediate certificate 2\nMy_certificate.crt is the final requested SSL certificate\n\n# Create a certificate bundle mychain.ca-bundle in Linux\ncat Intermediate2.crt  Intermediate1.crt Root.crt &gt; mychain.pem\n# Create a certificate bundle mychain.ca-bundle in Windows\ncopy Intermediate2.crt +  Intermediate1.crt + Root.crt mychain.pem"

You can override the ENTRYPOINT instruction using the docker run --entrypoint flag.\n\nThe shell form prevents any CMD or run command line arguments from being used, but has the disadvantage that your ENTRYPOINT will be started as a subcommand of /bin/sh -c, which does not pass signals. This means that the executable will not be the container\u2019s PID 1 - and will not receive Unix signals - so your executable will not receive a SIGTERM from docker stop &lt;container&gt;.\nOnly the last ENTRYPOINT instruction in the Dockerfile will have an effect.\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint"

In both cases, PII data is removed; however, anonymization irreversibly destroys any way of identifying the data subject, whereas pseudonymization substitutes the identity of the data subject in such a way that with some additional information it is possible to re-identify the data subject. In other words, with pseudonymization, some unique ID is still present, but it\u2019s not personally identifiable. Pseudonymization is less secure, as it allows re-identification either as a result of some authority\u2019s request or due to advanced analytics (for example, from knowing that same person went to certain places, it is possible to deduce who he/she is).\n\nEncryption, integrity, and nonrepudiation technologies are used to protect data confidentiality and reliability.

Currently, the only supported algorithm is spread, which tries to place them evenly. For instance, if you label each node with a label rack which has a value from 1-10, then specify a placement preference keyed on rack, then service tasks are placed as evenly as possible across all nodes with the label rack, after taking other placement constraints, placement preferences, and other node-specific limitations into account.\n\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/services/#control-service-placement"

Depends on how you use it (or maybe Cisco want's to take it up with Ansible's vendor, IBM: https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-orchestration). \n\nThe point is, such question shouldn't even exist as those definitions are largely based on each vendor's point of view.

The vault can be accessed by applications to retrieve the secrets when required.\n\nOption A is not recommended as it requires setting the API key as an environment variable which can be accessed by other applications running on the same machine.

So I agree with you, D is the best choice.  But wow, that answer choice should have been written a little more clearly!"

Release packaging is a technique that allows for dependencies to be effectively managed during deployments by staggering them between multiple releases. This means that different components of a software system can be released at different times, rather than all at once, which allows for more control over the dependencies between those components. This approach allows the development team to test, validate and deploy each release unit separately, therefore, reducing the risk of failure and allowing for a more controlled and efficient deployment process."

This approach promotes cleaner boundaries between units and simplifies the management and troubleshooting of the system.\n\nIf the deployment scenario requires a more flexible approach, with the ability to independently manage and test dependencies while allowing for gradual rollouts, option D could be a better choice. This approach acknowledges that dependencies may exist but seeks to control their introduction and impact.\n\nUltimately, the decision between option C and D should be based on factors such as the complexity of dependencies, the desired level of isolation, the deployment strategy, and the specific trade-offs and priorities of the project."

I am interpreting \"cross-region cloud\" to mean a public cloud provider with multiple regions, and you are deploying your services in multiple regions.\n\nWithin a region, public cloud providers have multiple availability zones.  If you don't have a DR or geographic latency requirement dictating multiple regions, you can operate within a single region and use multiple availability zones.  And that's great for most scenarios, as long as there isn't a large-scale outage that impacts all zones in a region (weather event that prevents fuel resupply to generators like a Hurricane Katrina event, war/conflict, meteor strike).  However, even then, public cloud providers have been known to have services fail across multiple zones in a region.  It's rare, and usually due to a design error that wasn't caught prior, but it happens from time to time.  So some public cloud customers want to have DR capability to fail over to a different geographic region."

This is because HTTP POST requests are not cached and will retrieve fresh data from the server each time, which can help ensure that the client always receives the most up-to-date data. In contrast, HTTP GET requests are cached by default, which can result in clients receiving stale data and increased load on the server due to repeated requests. Therefore, using HTTP POST or other non-read methods for read requests can help to improve the performance and responsiveness of the API."

The question is whether it's being caused by network latency (D) or excessive processing/fetching of back-end data as part of the API call (E)?  If the second API calls were maybe 6-7s, which is just a couple of seconds longer than the first API call, I'd vote for possibly network latency adding that delay.  But this is taking 13s to do the API call, that's not network latency.  That's an inefficient process happening on the back end to return the results for the API call."

This difference in duration indicates that the dnac-list-devices call is contributing significantly to the overall delay.\n\nD. Listing devices takes longer than usual due to high network latency:\n\nThe long duration of the dnac-list-devices span (13.25 seconds) suggests that there could be high network latency or other performance issues related to the API call. This is further supported by the fact that listing devices generally involves retrieving a large amount of data, which can be affected by network latency."

Columnar\nHere's why a columnar database is a good fit:\nData Structure: The application stores information about television shows, with well-defined attributes like scenario, year, and category. This structured data aligns well with columnar databases.\nHigh Performance: Columnar databases excel at querying specific columns, which is ideal for this scenario. When retrieving information about shows, users will likely be interested in specific fields like year or category. Columnar databases store data in columns, allowing for faster retrieval of these specific data points compared to row-oriented databases."

While some shows might have release dates, the overall structure doesn't heavily rely on time-based elements.\nC. Document-based: Document databases are flexible for storing various data formats, but they might not offer the same level of performance as columnar databases for querying specific fields in a structured dataset.\nD. Graph: Graph databases are powerful for representing relationships between entities. While there could be connections between shows (e.g., sequels), the primary focus here seems to be storing individual show information, making a columnar database a more suitable choice."

Instead of polling the API continuously to check for updates, which can lead to exceeding the rate limit, webhooks allow the API to notify your application when a specific event occurs. This reduces the number of API calls, thereby minimizing the risk of hitting rate limits and reducing latency.\n\nOther Options:\nA. MOS scoring system before collecting information:\n\nThis is typically used for quality of experience measurement in voice and video applications, not relevant for reducing API rate limits.\nB. Leaky faucet algorithm for fault categorizing:\n\nThis is not related to reducing API rate limits or latency.\nC. Error handling to check for reachability first:\n\nWhile good error handling is important, it won't directly address the issue of reducing API call frequency to avoid rate limits.\nTherefore, the best approach in this scenario is to implement webhooks to trigger updates."

Specifically, it is selecting the orders column from the purchases table where the username column matches the username variable. The username variable is passed in as a parameter in a dictionary format using the % operator to substitute the value into the query string. This approach is recommended for preventing SQL injection attacks because it ensures that user input is treated as data rather than as part of the SQL statement itself."

This makes it easier to develop clients that can read and understand the data, and it also allows for more efficient data collection.\n\nOne of the benefits of using model-driven telemetry is that it reduces the load on the server by enabling the client to pull data. This is because the client only needs to request the data that it needs, rather than receiving all of the data that is being collected. This can improve performance and scalability, especially for applications that are collecting a lot of data.\n\nSo the answer is (A)."

If the server microservice has implemented rate limiting (or even worse, has NOT implemented it), the client app might have to sleep for a bit, or sit with a spinner, or encounter errors.  Or, in the case of a massively-scaled malicious DDoS on a publicly-facing service, even handling all of the incoming API requests and responding with a 429 to every one can consume resources (and run up charges if it's a cloud-based API service).  It's easier for everybody if both sides (server and client) have rate limiting built into their interactions with each other."

The flow involves multiple steps where the client application first requests authorization from the user (the resource owner) by redirecting them to the authorization server. The user then grants or denies authorization, and if they grant it, the authorization server issues an authorization code to the client. The client then uses this authorization code to obtain an access token from the authorization server, which can be used to access the protected resources on behalf of the user.\n\nThe client ID is a unique identifier that is assigned to the client application by the authorization server when the client registers with the server. The authorization server is the server responsible for issuing access tokens to the client after the client presents the authorization code. The resource server is the server that hosts the protected resources that the client is trying to access using the access token."

Leverage middleware caching and respond with HTTP code 204 in the API response.\n\nMiddleware caching can significantly reduce load by storing the results of expensive queries and serving them for subsequent requests. However, responding with HTTP 204 is not typically associated with caching because 204 means \"No Content,\" which would indicate that there is no data to cache. Instead, a 304 \"Not Modified\" response might be used in conjunction with ETags or Last-Modified headers to indicate that the cached version of the response is still valid.\nC. Include the ETag header in the API response.\n\nThe ETag (Entity Tag) header is used in HTTP to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is identical to the current version of the resource on the server. If the ETag matches, the server can respond with a 304 Not Modified status, indicating that the client can use its cached version, thus saving on database queries and reducing server load."

Change the query to be more efficient** is a good option, because it can directly affect the performance of the server and reduce the API usage.\nChanging the query to be more efficient means optimizing how the server accesses and processes data from databases or other sources.\nThis can reduce the CPU and memory usage of the server, as well as shorten the response time and network bandwidth."

Leverage middleware caching and respond with HTTP code 204 in the API response** is a good option, because it can improve the performance of the server and reduce the API usage.\nMiddleware caching is a technique that stores frequently used data or responses in a layer between the server and the client, so that the server does not have to process the same request again.\nResponding with HTTP code 204 means that the server has successfully processed the request, but does not return any data in the response body. This can save network bandwidth and speed up the response time.\n\n- **C. Include the ETag header in the API response** is not a good option, because it does not optimize the API usage on the server, but rather on the client side .\nThe ETag header is a way of validating if a cached resource on the client side is still fresh or not.\nIt can help avoid unnecessary requests from the client to the server, but it does not reduce the load on the server or improve its performance."

I'm leaning towards A, because B doesn't specify how the environment variable is stored, and whether such storage is secure.  For example, storing on disk or in your git repo in a .env file is not secure.  Typing it in by hand like: export DB_PWD=\"pass\" and then using Python import os and then DB_PWD=os.getenv(\"DB_PWD\") still leaves it in RAM until you exit your shell after running the Python script.  Probably the best answer is using an API call to an on-prem or cloud-based secret manager within your code, and using the retrieved value."

This enables parallel execution of tasks, enhancing performance and efficiency.\n\nSimilarly, NETCONF supports asynchronous operations through the use of notifications and subscriptions. Notifications allow the device to send asynchronous updates to the client about specific events or conditions, while subscriptions enable the client to receive ongoing updates about changes in device state. This asynchronous capability allows for efficient handling of events and notifications without blocking the execution of other tasks.\n\nTherefore, both NX-API and NETCONF meet the requirement for supporting asynchronous requests."

HTTPS\n\nExplanation:\nTo meet the requirements of automating configurations on a Cisco NX-OS switch using Ansible, with encryption and support for asynchronous requests, the best options are:\n\nNX-API (B): NX-API (NXOS API) is Cisco's application programming interface for NX-OS based devices, which allows for commands to be sent to Cisco switches and responses to be received in a structured format such as JSON or XML. NX-API supports the use of HTTPS as its transport protocol, ensuring the encryption requirement is met. It also provides the capability to make calls and receive responses asynchronously.\n\nHTTPS (C): HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server. Using HTTPS as the transport protocol for NX-API ensures that the communication is encrypted, addressing the security requirement specified in the scenario. HTTPS is commonly used with NX-API to secure the data in transit."

The router is open for connections from the collector. This mode is useful to establish a single channel of communication with the router. Because the collector establishes the session, there is no need to create destinations in the configuration. Additionally, the protocol (gRPC) used to establish a session provides advanced security capabilities to authenticate and encrypt the session. If the connection between the router and the collector is lost, the session is cancelled. The collector must reconnect to the router to restart streaming data. Only gRPC supports dial-in session.\n\nTo explore the dial-in mode, and to create a dial-in session, see Establish a Model-Driven Telemetry Session from a Collector to a Router.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/710x/telemetry/configuration/guide/b-telemetry-cg-asr9000-710x/scale-up-your-network-monitoring-strategy-using-telemetry.html#id_117897:~:text=Use%20gRPC%20dial%2Din%20mode"

It involves associating each cache item with a surrogate key.

This approach is particularly useful when the same data is cached in multiple ways or when data is nested or complex."

Run microservices at the edge, on the periphery of the network.\n\nRunning microservices at the edge of the network, also known as edge computing, reduces latency by bringing data processing closer to the source of the data.

This simplicity is one of the cornerstones of Ansible\u2019s broad appeal. \n\nYet Ansible\u2019s human-readable declarative language, YAML, truly sets it apart.

In this model, the telemetry collector initiates the connection to the network device, and if the connection is lost for any reason, the collector can automatically attempt to reestablish the connection. This automatic recovery feature helps to improve the reliability of telemetry data collection and reduce the likelihood of data loss.\n\nThe other options (B, C, and D) do not accurately describe the advantages of using gRPC dial-in in the context of model-driven telemetry."
