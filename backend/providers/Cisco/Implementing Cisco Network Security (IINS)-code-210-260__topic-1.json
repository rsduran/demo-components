    "answerDescription": "Out-of-band refers to an interface that allows only management protocol traffic to be forwarded or processed. An out-of-band management interface is defined by the network operator to specifically receive network management traffic. The advantage isthat forwarding (or customer) traffic cannot interfere with the management of the router, which significantly reduces the possibility of denial-of-service attacks.<br>Out-of-band interfaces forward traffic only between out-of-band interfaces or terminate management packets that are destined to the router. In addition, the out-of- band interfaces can participate in dynamic routing protocols. The service provider connects to the routers out-of-band interfaces and builds an independent overlay management network, with all the routing and policy tools that the router can provide.<br>Reference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k_r4-0/security/configuration/guide/b_sc40asr9kbook/ b_sc40asr9kbook_chapter_0101.pdf",

In other words, different messages may be used for authentication than are used for authorization and accounting.

Because this event action is severe, administrators are advised to use this only when the probability of false alarms or spoofing is minimal.<br>Deny attacker service pair inline: This action prevents communication between the attacker IP address and the protected network on the port in which the event was detected. However, the attacker would be able to communicate on another port that has hosts on the protected network. This event action works well for worms that attack many hosts on the same service port. If an attack occurred on the same host but on another port, this communication would be allowed. This event action is appropriate when the likelihood of a false alarm or spoofing is minimal.<br>Deny attacker victim pair inline: This action prevents the attacker from communicating with the victim on any port. However, the attacker could communicate with other hosts, making this action better suited for exploits that target a specific host. This event action is appropriate when the likelihood of a false alarm or spoofing is minimal.<br>Deny connection inline: This action prevents further communication for the specific TCP flow. This action is appropriate when there is the potential for a false alarm or spoofing and when an administrator wants to prevent the action but not deny further communication.<br>Deny packet inline: This action prevents the specific offending packet from reaching its intended destination. Other communication between the attacker and victim or victim network may still exist. This action is appropriate when there is the potential for a false alarm or spoofing. Note that for this action, the default time has no effect.<br>Modify packet inline: This action enables the IPS device to modify the offending part of the packet.

Root guard does not allow the port to become an STP root port, so the port is always STP-designated.

You must enable root guard on all ports where the root bridge should not appear. In a way, you can configure a perimeter around the part of the network where the STP root is able to be located.<br>In the following figure, enable root guard on the Switch C port that connects to Switch D.<br>Switch C in figure below blocks the port that connects to Switch D, after the switch receives a superior BPDU. Root guard puts the port in the root-inconsistent<br>STP state. No traffic passes through the port in this state. After device D ceases to send superior BPDUs, the port is unblocked again. Via STP, the port goes from the listening state to the learning state, and eventually transitions to the forwarding state.

    "answerDescription": "The Root Guard feature can be enabled on all switch ports in the network off of which the root bridge should not appear (that is, every port that is not a root port , the port on each switch that is considered to be closest to the root bridge). If a port configured for Root Guard receives a superior BPDU, instead of believing the BPDU, the port goes into a root-inconsistent state. While a port is in the root-inconsistent state, no user data is sent across it. However, after the superior BPDUs stop, the port returns to the forwarding state.<br><br>The BPDU Guard feature is enabled on ports configured with the Cisco PortFast feature. The PortFast feature is enabled on ports that connect to end-user devices, such as PCs. It reduces the amount of time required for the port to go into forwarding state after being connected. The logic of PortFast is that a port that connects to an end-user device does not have the potential to create a topology loop. Therefore, the port can go active sooner by skipping STPs listening and learning states, which by default take 15 seconds each. Because these PortFast ports are connected to end-user devices, they should never receive a BPDU.<br>Therefore, if a port enabled for BPDU Guard receives a BPDU, the port is disabled.<br>Reference:<br>https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/4575",
