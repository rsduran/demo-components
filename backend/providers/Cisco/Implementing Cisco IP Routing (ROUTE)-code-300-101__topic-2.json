A larger window size is recommended to improve TCP performance in network paths with large bandwidth-delay product characteristics that are called Long Fat Networks (LFNs). The<br>TCP Window Scaling enhancement provides that support. The window scaling extension in Cisco IOS software expands the definition of the TCP window to 32 bits and then uses a scale factor to carry this 32-bit value in the 16-bit window field of the TCP header. The window size can increase to a scale factor of 14.<br>Typical applications use a scale factor of 3 when deployed in LFNs.<br>The TCP Window Scaling feature complies with RFC 1323. The larger scalable window size will allow TCP to perform better over LFNs. Use the iptcp window-size command in global configuration mode to configure the TCP window size. In order for this to work, the remote host must also support this feature and its window size must be increased.

    "answerDescription": "Mixing TCP with UDP -<br>It is a general best practice to not mix TCP-based traffic with UDP-based traffic (especially Streaming-Video) within a single service-provider class because of the behaviors of these protocols during periods of congestion. Specifically, TCP transmitters throttle back flows when drops are detected. Although some UDP applications have application-level windowing, flow control, and retransmission capabilities, most UDP transmitters are completely oblivious to drops and, thus, never lower transmission rates because of dropping. When TCP flows are combined with UDP flows within a single service-provider class and the class experiences congestion, TCP flows continually lower their transmission rates, potentially giving up their bandwidth to UDP flows that are oblivious to drops. This effect is called TCP starvation/UDP dominance.<br>TCP starvation/UDP dominance likely occurs if (TCP-based) Mission-Critical Data is assigned to the same service-provider class as (UDP-based) Streaming-<br>Video and the class experiences sustained congestion. Even if WRED is enabled on the service-provider class, the same behavior would be observed because<br>WRED (for the most part) manages congestion only on TCP-based flows.<br>Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/QoS_SRND/QoS- SRND-Book/VPNQoS.html<br>Topic 2, Layer 2 Technologies",

Split horizon blocks route information from being advertised by a router out of any interface from which that information originated. This behavior usually optimizes communications among multiple routing devices, particularly when links are broken. However, with nonbroadcast networks (such as Frame Relay and SMDS), situations can arise for which this behavior is less than ideal. For these situations, you may want to disable split horizon. In this example, routes received by RTB and RTC are not being sent back out the same serial interface on RTA, so they are not receiving each other`s routes.

    "answerDescription": "Stub routing is commonly used in a hub and spoke network topology. In a hub and spoke network, one or more end (stub) networks are connected to a remote router (the spoke) that is connected to one or more distribution routers (the hub). The remote router is adjacent only to one or more distribution routers.<br>The only route for IP traffic to follow into the remote router is through a distribution router. This type of configuration is commonly used in WAN topologies where the distribution router is directly connected to a WAN. The distribution router can be connected to many more remote routers. Often, the distribution router will be connected to 100 or more remote routers. In a hub and spoke topology, the remote router must forward all nonlocal traffic to a distribution router, so it becomes unnecessary for the remote router to hold a complete routing table. Generally, the distribution router need not send anything more than a default route to the remote router.<br>When using the EIGRP Stub Routing feature, you need to configure the distribution and remote routers to use EIGRP, and to configure only the remote router as a stub. Only specified routes are propagated from the remote (stub) router. The router responds to queries for summaries, connected routes, redistributed static routes, external routes, and internal routes with the message \"inaccessible.\" A router that is configured as a stub will send a special peer information packet to all neighboring routers to report its status as a stub router.<br>Any neighbor that receives a packet informing it of the stub status will not query the stub router for any routes, and a router that has a stub peer will not query that peer. The stub router will depend on the distribution router to send the proper updates to all peers.<br>Reference: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_0s/feature/guide/eigrpstb.html",

But EIGRP can support unequal cost path load balancing. By configuring the variance value of<br>2, the minimum metric is increased to 60 (30 * 2) and all the routes that have a metric of less than or equal to 60 and satisfy the feasibility condition will be used to send traffic.<br>Besides the main path A-D-E-H we have 4 more paths that have the metric of less than or equal to 60 (we also include the Advertised Distances of these routes for later comparison):<br>+ A-B-E-H with an AD of 20<br>+ A-D-E-B-C-H with an AD of 50<br>+ A-F-G-H with an AD of 40<br>+ A-F-E-H with an AD of 20<br>Now the last thing we need to consider is the feasible condition. The feasible condition states:<br>\"To qualify as a feasible successor, a router must have an AD less than the FD of the current successor route\"<br>The FD of the current successor route here is 30 (notice that the variance number is not calculated here). Therefore there are only 2 paths that can satisfy this conditions: the path A- B-E-H &amp; A-F-E-H.<br>In conclusion, traffic from the Internet to the data center will be load balanced across 3 paths, including the main path (successor path)",

The queried routers resources are unavailable, generally due to high CPU utilization. The queried routers memory is corrupt or otherwise unable to allow the router to answer the query.<br>The link between the two routers is of low quality, allowing just enough packets through to keep the neighbor relationship intact, but not good enough to allow the replies through.<br>To sum it up, routes generally become SIA when a neighbor either doesnt answer a query, or either the query or reply took a wrong turn somewhere.

The eigrp stub command can be modified with several options, and these options can be used in any combination except for the receive-only keyword. The receive-only keyword will restrict the router from sharing any of its routes with any other router in that EIGRP autonomous system, and the receive-only keyword will not permit any other option to be specified because it prevents any type of route from being sent. The three other optional keywords (connected, static, and summary) can be used in any combination but cannot be used with the receive- only keyword. If any of these three keywords is used individually with the eigrp stub command, connected and summary routes will not be sent automatically.<br>The connected keyword will permit the EIGRP Stub Routing feature to send connected routes. If the connected routes are not covered by a network statement, it may be necessary to redistribute connected routes with the redistribute connected command under the EIGRP process. This option is enabled by default.<br>The static keyword will permit the EIGRP Stub Routing feature to send static routes. Without the configuration of this option, EIGRP will not send any static routes, including internal static routes that normally would be automatically redistributed. It will still be necessary to redistribute static routes with the redistribute static command.<br>The summary keyword will permit the EIGRP Stub Routing feature to send summary routes. Summary routes can be created manually with the summary address command or automatically at a major network border router with the auto-summary command enabled.<br>This option is enabled by default.<br>In the following example, the eigrp stub command is used to configure the router as a stub that advertises connected and summary routes: router eigrp 1 network 10.0.0.0 eigrp stub<br>In the following example, the eigrp stub command is issued with the connected and static keywords to configure the router as a stub that advertises connected and static routes (sending summary routes will not be permitted): router eigrp 1 network 10.0.0.0 eigrp stub connected static<br>In the following example, the eigrp stub command is issued with the receive-only keyword to configure the router as a receive-only neighbor (Connected, summary, and static routes will not be sent): router eigrp 1 network 10.0.0.0 eigrp eigrp stub receive-only<br>Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1829/products_feature_guide09186a00 80087026.html",

Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an enhanced distance-vector protocol based on the diffusing update algorithm (DUAL). It is capable of (conservatively) finding all loop-free paths to any given destination based on route advertisements from neighbors. The neighbor (or neighbors) with the best path to a destination is called the successor. The remaining neighbors with loop-free paths to the destination are called feasible successors. To reduce traffic load on the network, EIGRP maintains neighbor relationships and exchanges routing information only as needed, using a query process to find alternate paths when all loop-free paths to a destination have failed.",

    "answerDescription": "Extended Unique Identifier (EUI), as per RFC2373, allows a host to assign iteslf a unique 64-Bit IP Version 6 interface identifier (EUI-64). This feature is a key benefit over IPv4 as it eliminates the need of manual configuration or DHCP as in the world of IPv4. The IPv6 EUI-64 format address is obtained through the 48-bit<br>MAC address. The Mac address is first separated into two 24-bits, with one being OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and the other being NIC specific. The<br>16-bit 0xFFFE is then inserted between these two 24-bits to for the 64-bit EUI address. IEEE has chosen FFFE as a reserved value which can only appear in EUI-<br>64 generated from the an EUI-48 MAC address.<br>Here is an example showing how a the Mac Address is used to generate EUI.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02670/n18846100001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Next, the seventh bit from the left, or the universal/local (U/L) bit, needs to be inverted. This bit identifies whether this interface identifier is universally or locally administered. If 0, the address is locally administered and if 1, the address is globally unique. It is worth noticing that in the OUI portion, the globally unique addresses assigned by the IEEE has always been set to 0 whereas the locally created addresses has 1 configured. Therefore, when the bit is inverted, it maintains its original scope (global unique address is still global unique and vice versa). The reason for inverting can be found in RFC4291 section 2.5.1.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02670/n18846100000.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Once the above is done, we have a fully functional EUI-64 format address.

    "answerDescription": "Router Advertisements (RA) are sent in response to router solicitation messages. Router solicitation messages, which have a value of 133 in the Type field of the<br>ICMP packet header, are sent by hosts at system startup so that the host can immediately autoconfigure without needing to wait for the next scheduled RA message. Given that router solicitation messages are usually sent by hosts at system startup (the host does not have a configured unicast address), the source address in router solicitation messages is usually the unspecified IPv6 address (0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0). If the host has a configured unicast address, the unicast address of the interface sending the router solicitation message is used as the source address in the message. The destination address in router solicitation messages is the all-routers multicast address with a scope of the link. When an RA is sent in response to a router solicitation, the destination address in the RA message is the unicast address of the source of the router solicitation message. RA messages typically include the following information:<br><br>One or more onlink IPv6 prefixes that nodes on the local link can use to automatically configure their IPv6 addresses<br><br>Lifetime information for each prefix included in the advertisement <br>Sets of flags that indicate the type of autoconfiguration (stateless or stateful) that can be completed<br><br>Default router information (whether the router sending the advertisement should be used as a default router and, if so, the amount of time (in seconds) the router should be used as a default router)<br><br>Additional information for hosts, such as the hop limit and MTU a host should use in packets that it originates<br>Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ipv6/configuration/guide/12_4t/ipv6_12_4t_book/ip6- addrg_bsc_con.html",

This means that an mGRE tunnel on the hub may connect to a p2p tunnel on the branch. Conversely, a p2p<br>GRE tunnel may connect to an mGRE tunnel. The distinguishing feature between an mGRE interface and a p2p GRE interface is the tunnel destination. An mGRE interface does not have a configured destination. Instead the GRE tunnel is configured with the command tunnel mode gre multipoint. This command is used instead of the tunnel destination x.x.x.x found with p2p GRE tunnels. Besides allowing for multiple destinations, an mGRE tunnel requires NHRP to resolve the tunnel endpoints. Note, tunnel interfaces by default are point-to-point (p-p) using GRE encapsulation, effectively they have the tunnel mode gre command, which is not seen in the configuration because it is the default.<br>The mGRE configuration is as follows:<br>!<br>interface Tunnel0<br>bandwidth 1536<br>ip address 10.62.1.10 255.255.255.0<br>tunnel source Serial0/0<br>tunnel mode gre multipoint<br>Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/DMVPDG/DMVP N_2_Phase2.html",

    "answer": "D. broadcast mode, loose mode, and VRF mode",
    "answerDescription": "Network administrators can use Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) to help limit the malicious traffic on an enterprise network. This security feature works by enabling a router to verify the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. This capability can limit the appearance of spoofed addresses on a network. If the source IP address is not valid, the packet is discarded. Unicast RPF works in one of three different modes: strict mode, loose mode, or VRF mode. Note that not all network devices support all three modes of operation. Unicast RPF in VRF mode will not be covered in this document. When administrators use Unicast RPF in strict mode, the packet must be received on the interface that the router would use to forward the return packet. Unicast RPF configured in strict mode may drop legitimate traffic that is received on an interface that was not the router's choice for sending return traffic. Dropping this legitimate traffic could occur when asymmetric routing paths are present in the network.<br>When administrators use Unicast RPF in loose mode, the source address must appear in the routing table. Administrators can change this behavior using the allow-default option, which allows the use of the default route in the source verification process. Additionally, a packet that contains a source address for which the return route points to the Null 0 interface will be dropped. An access list may also be specified that permits or denies certain source addresses in Unicast RPF loose mode.<br>Care must be taken to ensure that the appropriate Unicast RPF mode (loose or strict) is configured during the deployment of this feature because it can drop legitimate traffic. Although asymmetric traffic flows may be of concern when deploying this feature, Unicast RPF loose mode is a scalable option for networks that contain asymmetric routing paths.

    "answerDescription": "Most network admins and engineers are familiar with SNMPv2c which has become the dominant SNMP version of the past decade. It`s simple to configure on both the router/switch-side and just as easy on the network monitoring server. The problem of course is that the SNMP statistical payload is not encrypted and authentication is passed in cleartext. Most companies have decided that the information being transmitted isn`t valuable enough to be worth the extra effort in upgrading to SNMPv3, but I would suggest otherwise. Like IPv4 to IPv6, there are some major changes under the hood. SNMP version 2 uses community strings<br>(think cleartext passwords, no encryption) to authenticate polling and trap delivery. SNMP version 3 moves away from the community string approach in favor of user- based authentication and view-based access control. The users are not actual local user accounts, rather they are simply a means to determine who can authenticate to the device. The view is used to define what the user account may access on the IOS device. Finally, each user is added to a group, which determines the access policy for its users. Users, groups, views.

So we can deduce that one line is used for successor and the other is used for another route to that network. Each of these two lines has 2 parameters: the first one (156160 or 157720) is the Feasible<br>Distance (FD) and the second (128256 or 155160) is the Advertised Distance (AD) of that route.<br>The next thing we want to know is: if the route via 172.17.10.2 (the last line) would become the feasible successor for the 10.140.0.0/24 network. To figure out, we have to compare the Advertised Distance of that route with the Feasible Distance of the successor`s route, if AD &lt; FD then it will become the feasible successor.<br>In this case, because AD (155160) &lt; FD (156160) so it will become the feasible successor. Therefore we can conclude the network 10.140.0.0/24 has 1 feasible successor.<br>Because the question asks about feasible successor so we just need to focus on entries which have more paths than the number of successor. In this case, we find 3 entries that are in blue boxes because they have only 1 successor but has 2 paths, so the last path can be the feasible successor.<br>By comparing the value of AD (of that route) with the FD (of successor`s route) we figure out there are 2 entries will have the feasible successor: the first and the second entry.

So the routing table of R2 will have the network 10.10.10.0/24 (not be summarized).<br>When exiting S1 interface of R2, EIGRP summarizes network 172.16.10.0/24 into the major 172.16.0.0/16 network but it does not summarize network<br>10.10.10.0/24 because it is not directly connected with this network.

    "answerDescription": "Explanation -<br>When the link between R1 and R2 is down, R2 loses its successor for the network 10.1.1.0/24. R2 checks its topology table for a feasible successor but it can`t find one. So R2 goes active on the that route to find a new successor by sending queries out to its neighbors (R3 and R5) requesting a path to the lost route. Both<br>R3 and R5 also go active for the that route. But R5 doesn`t have any neighbor to ask besides R2 so it will send an unreachable message to indicate it has no alternative path for that route and has no other neighbor to query. R3 also checks its EIRGP topology table for a feasible successor but it has none, too. Unlike R5,<br>R3 has a neighbor (R4) so it continues to query this router.<br>Now suppose there is a problem on the link between R3 and R4 so R4 never receives the query from R3 and of course, R3 also never receives a reply back from<br>R4. Therefore, R3 can`t reply back to R2. After about 3 minutes, the Stuck in active (SIA) timer on R2 expires and R2 marks the route 10.1.1.0/24 as stuck in active route.<br>The output line via 10.1.3.3 (Infinity/Infinity), r, Seiral0, serno 1232 indicates R2 has sent a query to 10.1.3.3 and is waiting for a reply (the lowercase r).<br>(Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a008010f016.shtml)",

The command enables the suppression of routing updates over some interfaces while it allows updates to be exchanged normally over other interfaces. With most routing protocols, the passive-interface command restricts outgoing advertisements only. However, when used with Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), the effect is slightly different. With EIGRP running on a network, the passive- interface command stops both outgoing and incoming routing updates, since the effect of the command causes the router to stop sending and receiving hello packets over an interface.<br>Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093f0a.shtml",

    "answerDescription": "The Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) Stub Routing feature improves network stability, reduces resource utilization, and simplifies stub router configuration. Stub routing is commonly used in a hub and spoke network topology. In a hub and spoke network, one or more end (stub) networks are connected to a remote router (the spoke) that is connected to one or more distribution routers (the hub). The remote router is adjacent only to one or more distribution routers.<br>The only route for IP traffic to follow into the remote router is through a distribution router. This type of configuration is commonly used in WAN topologies where the distribution router is directly connected to a WAN. The distribution router can be connected to many more remote routers. Often, the distribution router will be connected to 100 or more remote routers. In a hub and spoke topology, the remote router must forward all nonlocal traffic to a distribution router, so it becomes unnecessary for the remote router to hold a complete routing table. Generally, the distribution router need not send anything more than a default route to the remote router.<br>When using the EIGRP Stub Routing feature, you need to configure the distribution and remote routers to use EIGRP, and to configure only the remote router as a stub. Only specified routes are propagated from the remote (stub) router. The router responds to queries for summaries, connected routes, redistributed static routes, external routes, and internal routes with the message \"inaccessible.\" A router that is configured as a stub will send a special peer information packet to all neighboring routers to report its status as a stub router.<br>Any neighbor that receives a packet informing it of the stub status will not query the stub router for any routes, and a router that has a stub peer will not query that peer. The stub router will depend on the distribution router to send the proper updates to all peers.

    "answerDescription": "Memory issues usually come up when too many external routes are injected in the OSPF domain. A backbone area with 40 routers and a default route to the outside world would have less memory issues compared with a backbone area with 4 routers and 33,000 external routes being injected into OSPF. Router memory could also be conserved by using a good OSPF design. Summarization at the area border routers and use of stub areas could further minimize the number of routes exchanged.<br>The total memory used by OSPF is the sum of the memory used in the routing table ( show ip route summary ) and the memory used in the LSDB. The following numbers are a \"rule of thumb\" estimate. Each entry in the routing table will consume between approximately 200 and 280 bytes plus 44 bytes per extra path. Each<br>LSA will consume a 100 byte overhead plus the size of the actual LSA, possibly another 60 to 100 bytes (For router links, this depends on the number of interfaces on the router). These amounts should be added to memory already used by other processes and by the IOS itself.<br>If you really want to know the exact number, you can do a show memory with and without OSPF being turned on. The difference in the processor memory used would be the answer.",

The underlying network treats the network as a series of point-to-point circuits. It replicates LSA packets for each circuit. OSPF traffic is sent as multicast. There is no DR or BDR election. This technology uses one IP subnet for all endpoints on the network.<br>By default, the network is considered to be a series of point-to-point interfaces. There is no need to specify neighbors, because the neighbors will see each other and simply become adjacent, with no need for the election of a DR or a BDR. Point-to-multipoint does not try to reduce adjacencies using a DR. Instead, it accepts the extra overhead of having a full set of adjacencies for the sake of stability. Point-to-multipoint forms an adjacency automatically along any PVC, which causes more overhead but is more resilient than NBMA.",
