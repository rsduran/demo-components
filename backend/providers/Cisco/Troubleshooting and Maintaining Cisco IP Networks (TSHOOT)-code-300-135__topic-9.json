        "content": "This is a typical Cisco exam question, far too open to interpretation but I have to agree with James - correct answer is C.  The question clearly states \"a trouble ticket has been opened indicating that Client 1 cannot ping the 209.65.200.241 address\" - it doesn't mention Client 2 at all.  IMO we shouldn't assume Client 2 has to be fixed even though the question's scenario/description suggests it would be affected by the same issue as Client 1. \n\nOf course that's only an opinion. Anyone out there get this question in the exam and get a 100% pass?  If so, what was their answer?"
