For example:\n\n    Switch Stacking: Meraki switches can be stacked to create a single logical switch with redundant links between switches, providing resilience against switch failures.\n    Warm Spare (HA): Certain Meraki security appliances support a high availability (HA) configuration where a standby unit takes over in case the primary unit fails. This ensures continuous operation and minimal downtime.\n    AP Redundancy: Meraki wireless access points can be configured with redundancy, where nearby access points can provide coverage if one access point fails."
