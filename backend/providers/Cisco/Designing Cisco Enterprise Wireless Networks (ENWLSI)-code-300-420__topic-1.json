Use a single IP address to create a static NAT entry: It's not specific enough, create a Single IP Static NAT Entry of what ? it doesn't specify anything or say it's for the server and it needs to be very clear. \nC. Build one-to-one NAT translation for every user that needs access: This is not feasible, you are not going to create a Static NAT for every host so this is wrong. \nD. Re-IP overlapping address space in the acquired company: When you acquire a company with overlapping networks you want to try to avoid re-IP the entire network initially. The question also states you want to keep the same IP Subnet space which means you want to keep things as it is so a redo of IP Subnets is not an option. \n\nLeaves us with the only correct answer which is A.

To prevent this, it is recommended to configure EIGRP to only form neighborships on physical interfaces where necessary, rather than on all SVIs.\n\nOption A, performing manual summarization on all Layer 3 interfaces to minimize the size of the routing table, may be useful in some cases, but it is not a specific design consideration for EIGRP on Data Center switches."

By the way, R1 (Hub) won't even bother sending queries to R3 stub router either which also makes this answer correct. This answer can be found on the OCG Book Page 147 &amp; 148, if you take time reading it you'll find it. This feature is cool but be careful and read it carefully."

Fast reroute means we switch to another next hop, Loop-free alternate is an alternative path in the network that is loop free.\n\nNow you might be thinking that this sounds familiar. After all, EIGRP has feasible successors. Those are loop-free alternate paths that EIGRP has calculated. If the successor fails, EIGRP can use a feasible successor right away.\n\nThis is true, but there\u2019s one big \u201cgotcha\u201d. EIGRP feasible successors are not installed in the routing table right away. Only the successor route is installed. When the successor fails, EIGRP installs the feasible successor, and this takes time. Fast reroute installs both the successor route and the feasible successor route in the routing table which makes convergence even faster."

LISP eliminates router processing for every IP destination address and route by moving the remote destination information to the LISP Map Server (MS), a centralized mapping database, and a control plane node in SD-Access. The LISP MS allows the routers to manage their local routes and query the map system to locate destination Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs).\n\nIt provides SD-Access benefits such as smaller routing tables, dynamic host mobility for wireless and wired network endpoints, and built-in network segmentation via VRF instances. Cisco SD-Access also includes distributed Anycast Gateway, VN Extranet, and Fabric Wireless."

SSO enables a device to maintain its forwarding capability while recovering from a processor failure, minimizing the impact on network traffic. This is accomplished by synchronizing the control plane information between the active and standby processors in the device. In the event of a processor failure, the standby processor takes over the control plane functions without causing any disruption to the forwarding plane."

This means that each router sends BFD packets periodically, regardless of whether or not it has received any BFD packets from its neighbor.\n\nIn contrast, BFD synchronous mode requires both routers in a BFD adjacency to agree on the interval at which BFD packets are sent. This means that both routers must be synchronized, which can require more CPU resources.\n\nAdditionally, BFD asynchronous mode does not require BFD packets to be acknowledged. This means that BFD packets can be sent and received more quickly, which can also reduce CPU usage."

Implement BFD asynchronous mode between peers with low CPU resources.\n\nBidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) has two modes of operation: echo mode and asynchronous mode. In echo mode, BFD packets are sent back and forth between peers, and the forwarding plane handles the processing, which can lead to high CPU utilization.\n\nIn asynchronous mode, BFD control packets are sent periodically between peers, and the control plane handles the processing. Asynchronous mode is less CPU-intensive compared to echo mode. Thus, implementing BFD asynchronous mode between peers with low CPU resources can help reduce the CPU load on these network devices."

The architect should utilize loop guard on SW2.\n\nLoop guard is a Layer 2 protocol that is designed to prevent forwarding loops caused by unidirectional links or other issues that can result in a break in the Layer 2 topology. When a port is designated as a root or alternate port, it is expected to receive BPDUs from the designated bridge, and it sends its own BPDUs out that port. If the port stops receiving BPDUs, it is considered a possible loop condition. Loop guard places the root port into a loop-inconsistent state to avoid forwarding loops, which prevents the forwarding of data frames until the issue is resolved."

Implement Enhanced Object Tracking on router R1\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo achieve automatic failover with HSRP, you can use Enhanced Object Tracking (EOT) and IP SLA. EOT is a feature that enables tracking of a configurable object and can modify HSRP priority or state based on the status of the tracked object. IP SLA is a feature that generates and sends synthetic traffic to a specified destination and can trigger EOT based on the status of the tracked object. By configuring IP SLA on router R1 to track WAN 1 and then configuring EOT on R1 to decrement the HSRP priority or change the HSRP state, you can achieve automatic failover to router R2 in the event of a WAN 1 failure."

Route leaking involves selectively sharing or injecting routes from one VN to another, thereby enabling traffic to flow between the isolated VNs.\n\nKey points about route leaking in an SD-WAN architecture:\n\nFabric Border Nodes: Route leaking typically occurs at the border nodes of the SD-WAN fabric. These nodes are responsible for connecting the overlay VNs to external networks.\n\nALSO: FABRIC ROUTERS ARE USED ON SD-ACCESS NOT SD-WAN !! BE CAREFUL"

By configuring GRE tunnels between the fabric edge devices, traffic from one VN can be sent through the tunnel to another VN, enabling inter-VN communication.\n\nHowever, option A, which involves using external fusion routers to map VNs to VRFs and selectively route traffic between VRFs, is a more common approach in SD-WAN architectures. It offers greater flexibility and control for policy-based routing, whereas GRE tunneling may require manual configuration and maintenance of tunnels, which can be more complex and less scalable in large deployments.\n\nSo, while both options A and B can be used to enable communication between overlay VNs, option A is more common and generally more suitable for SD-WAN architectures."

In an SD-WAN environment, FEC helps maintain a better application experience by reducing the impact of packet loss and improving the overall quality of the connection.\n\nUtilizing quality of service (QoS): QoS is a set of techniques used to manage and prioritize network traffic to ensure that critical applications receive the required bandwidth and performance levels. In an SD-WAN environment, QoS can be used to prioritize important applications over less critical ones, ensuring that the user experience remains consistent and optimal for essential applications even in situations with limited bandwidth or network congestion."

In dual-WAN Edge sites without any policy enabled, equal cost paths exist over each transport and to each WAN Edge router, and network traffic is hashed depending on fields in the IP header. Traffic is unlikely to always be forwarded to the same WAN Edge router in both the LAN-to-WAN direction and the WAN-to-LAN direction. To maintain symmetric traffic, it is recommended to set up routing so that traffic prefers one WAN Edge over another at dual-WAN Edge router sites."

Traffic must be symmetrical as it egresses the WAN Edges and returns from remote sites for DPI to function properly.\n\nWhen dual WAN Edge routers are deployed at a branch site, one of the design considerations is to ensure that traffic is symmetrical as it egresses the WAN Edges and returns from remote sites. This symmetry is crucial for proper functioning of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and other security features that require consistent traffic flows. Asymmetric traffic flows can lead to incorrect DPI results, ineffective security policies, and overall degraded network performance. To achieve symmetrical traffic flows, it's essential to carefully plan routing policies and load balancing mechanisms in the SD-WAN design."

It uses a shared tree architecture to support interdomain multicast communication.\n\nMSDP (Option D): MSDP (Multicast Source Discovery Protocol) is used to exchange information between domains about multicast sources. MSDP allows routers in one domain to learn about multicast sources in other domains and to forward traffic to those sources. MSDP operates at the edge of each domain and is used in conjunction with BIDIR-PIM.\n\nIn summary, BIDIR-PIM and MSDP are two protocols that are deployed to achieve interdomain multicast communication between multicast sources and receivers."

I don't know how i'm supposed to interpret that. In the real world, you would be told explicitly whether changes can be implemented or not. The only other thing that comes to mind would be if you had to make changes throughout the entire network. Marking the mgmt traffic to CS6 would alleviate you from having to go into each and every device to make changes to the config. However the other side to that argument is you still have to go into every device to mark the mgmt traffic as CS6. \nCould we not just add this config class-map match-any ROUTING??\nmatch ip dscp CS2"

Although there are many alternative routing protocols, the IS-IS routing protocol offers operational advantages such as neighbor establishment without IP protocol dependencies, peering capability using loopback addresses, and agnostic treatment of IPv4, IPv6, and non-IP traffic. Manual underlays are also supported and allow variations from the automated underlay deployment (for example, a different IGP could be chosen), though the underlay design principles still apply."

Note that the System IP address is used instead of the interface IP address as an identifier for a TLOC route. That\u2019s because the interface IP can change at any given moment. Using the fixed System-IP ensures that the TLOC can be uniquely identified at all times irrespective of any interface IP changes. This is very important because an OMP route (vRoute) has a next-hop pointing to a TLOC. This separation of information allows TLOC routes to be updated with new parameters without having to invalidate the dependent vRoutes. If a vEdge router has multiple transport interfaces connected to different WAN providers, as shown in figure 7, a TLOC route is created and advertised for each WAN interface.\n\nDTLS or TLS provides communication privacy between Cisco SD-WAN devices in the network, using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) encryption algorithm to encrypt all control traffic sent over the connections"

This is very useful when a router connects a trusted network to an untrusted network such as the Internet. MPP applies to all management protocols, such as SSH, HTTPS, and SNMP. This feature is configured using the management-interface command in the control pane. This command can be repeated to enable the same or a different set of protocols on other interfaces. One key restriction of this feature is that it cannot be applied to an out-of-band management interface (also called a dedicated management interface), if the device has one. Example 2-12 shows the usage of this command.\nhttps://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2928193&amp;seqNum=2#:~:text=The%20Management%20Plane%20Protection%20(MPP,SSH%2C%20HTTPS%2C%20and%20SNMP."

The dual-stack routers automatically encapsulate IPv6 packets inside IPv4 packets for transmission over the IPv4 network and then decapsulate them when they reach the destination IPv6 network."

This is done by separating the control and the data plane, having one process involved in building the routing table and another process in forwarding the packets. This feature takes advantage of CEF which updates the line cards with the information from FIB."
