This is a significant shift from Layer 2 switching that traditionally leverages data plane learning, and it is justified by the need to limit flooding of Layer 2 traffic across the transport infrastructure. As outlined in this chapter, Layer 2 communication between sites resembles routing more than switching. If the destination MAC address information is unknown, traffic is dropped (not flooded), preventing the waste of precious bandwidth across the WAN\n\nAnswer is C"

As long as one link in the fabric port channel remains active, the fabric port channel continues to operate.\n\nIf the correct hardware is connected, fabric port channels are created by Cisco UCS Manager in the following ways:\n\nDuring chassis discovery according to the settings configured in the chassis discovery policy.\n\nAfter chassis discovery according to the settings configured in the chassis connectivity policy for a specific chassis.\n\nFor each IOM there is a single fabric port channel. Each uplink connecting an IOM to a fabric interconnect can be configured as a discrete link or included in the port channel, but an uplink cannot belong to more than one fabric port channel. For example, if a chassis with two IOMs is discovered and the chassis discovery policy is configured to create fabric port channels, Cisco UCS Manager creates two separate fabric port channels: one for the uplinks connecting IOM-1 and another for the uplinks connecting IOM-2."

Meaning, 8 bits of data gets encoded into 10 bits of transmitted information \u2013 the two bits are used for data integrity.   Well, if the link is 8Gb, how much do we actually get to use for data \u2013 given that 2 out of every 10 bits aren\u2019t \u201cuser\u201d data?   FC link speeds are somewhat of an anomaly, given that they\u2019re actually faster than the stated link speed would suggest.   Original 1Gb FC is actually 1.0625Gb/s, and each generation has kept this standard and multiplied it.  8Gb FC would be 8\u00d71.0625, or actual bandwidth of 8.5Gb/s.   8.5*.80 = 6.8.   6.8Gb of usable bandwidth on an 8Gb FC link.\n\n10GE (and 10G FC, for that matter) uses 64b/66b encoding.   For every 64 bits of data, only 2 bits are used for integrity checks.   While theoretically this lowers the overall protection of the data, and increases the amount of data discarded in case of failure, that actual number of data units that are discarded due to failing serialization/deserialization is minuscule.    For a 10Gb link using 64b/66b encoding, that leaves 96.96% of the bandwidth for user data, or 9.7Gb/s."

Configure the vPC peer gateway to enable the HSRP routers to directly handle packets sent to the local vPC peer MAC address and the remote vPC peer MAC address, as well as the HSRP virtual MAC address.

End Host Mode: End Host Mode is essential because it allows the Cisco UCS fabric interconnects to behave as end-host devices, conserving domain IDs and facilitating the control of traffic flow from UCS blades to the SAN. This ensures efficient utilization of domain IDs and simplifies management.\n\nD. N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV): NPIV is crucial for allowing multiple N-Port WWNs to share a single physical port on the Fibre Channel switch. It enables each UCS blade to have its unique WWN and independently log in to the SAN fabric without the need for a separate physical port for each blade. This addresses the requirement to map SAN traffic from UCS blades to specific fabric interconnect ports while conserving domain IDs.\n\nThese two options (B and D) are the correct answers because they directly align with the requirements mentioned in the question, ensuring efficient use of SAN resources and control over UCS blade traffic.\n[High quality and reasonable used Cisco = https://altatechnologies.com/collections/used-cisco ]"

A Cisco engineer is configuring a FlexPod data center for SAP with Cisco ACI, Cisco UCS Manager 4.0, and NetApp AFF A-Series. All systems and fabric links feature redundancy and provide end-to-end high availability. After the engineer sets the needed VLANs on the NetApp controller ports and adds them to the data broadcast domain, the engineer must make the storage disks visible for the UCS hosts. Which action must be taken on the UCS to accomplish this task?",
