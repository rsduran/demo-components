Outbreak Filters rewrites the URLs in non-viral attack messages to redirect the recipient through the Cisco web security proxy if they attempt to access any of the linked websites. The proxy displays a splash screen that warns the user that the website may contain malware, if the website is still operational, or displays an error message if the website has been taken offline. See Redirecting URLs for more information on redirecting URLs.\nModify. In addition to rewriting URLs in non-viral threat messages, Outbreak Filters can modify a message\u2019s subject and add a disclaimer above the message body to warn users about the message\u2019s content.

First, mark up messages leaving your ESA. Look for that markup on any bounce messages, if the markup is present, it means that this is a bounce of a message that originated in your environment. If the markup is missing, the bounce is fraudulent and can be rejected or dropped.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa11-1/user_guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_11_1/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_chapter_011001.html?bookSearch=true#con_1134690"

Bounce Profile.\n\nActivating the Bounce Profile feature helps to address backscatter by controlling and customizing how bounce messages are handled by the Cisco ESA. The Bounce Profile allows administrators to define specific actions for different types of bounce messages, such as dropping them, sending them to quarantine, or redirecting them to a specific email address.\n\nBy configuring the Bounce Profile appropriately, administrators can minimize the impact of backscatter, reduce unnecessary bounce messages, and prevent innocent parties from receiving bounce notifications for spoofed or malicious emails.\n\nWhile features like Graymail Detection, Forged Email Detection, and Bounce Verification are important for overall email security, they are not specifically designed to combat backscatter. The Bounce Profile feature specifically addresses the management of bounce messages and helps mitigate the impact of backscatter."

Create DMARC profile: DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is a policy framework that builds upon SPF and DKIM to provide additional email authentication and reporting capabilities.

In order to ensure the security and privacy of the quarantined emails, authentication is required before granting access to the quarantine. This means that users need to provide valid credentials, such as a username and password, to authenticate themselves before accessing the quarantine interface.\n\nOptions A and B are not accurate because the Guest role and access via a link in a notification are not specifically required restrictions for accessing the spam quarantine.\n\nOption C is partially correct as authentication is indeed required, but it specifically mentions accessing via a link in a notification, which may not be the only method of accessing the spam quarantine.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa14-0/user_guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_14-0/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_1_chapter_0100000.html?bookSearch=true#con_1624156"
