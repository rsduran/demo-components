It delivers a new standard of software-defined flexibility and performance, and offers a low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). The 5000 ENCS is a hybrid platform that combines the best attributes of a traditional router and a traditional server and offers the same functionality with a smaller infrastructure footprint. Offered with the Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv) and NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) as the hosting layer, the platform offers a complete solution for a simplified deployment. It also accelerates some functions in hardware such as inter-VM traffic flows, IP Security (IPsec) crypto, and RAID for storage. Built-in lights-out management is also supported with Cisco Integrated Management Controller on certain models."
