This can secure network resources (WiFi access, Exchange emails) without relying on the device user to remove the SM agent from their device.\n\nThis feature is most typically utilized when a BYOD device user is no longer affiliated with the Organization, or as an intermediary step before fully wiping a lost or stolen device.
