Based on rules that you define, a unique identifier (the tag) is inserted in each frame header before it is forwarded. The tag is examined and understood by each device before any broadcasts or transmissions to other switches, routers, or end stations. When the frame reaches the last switch or router, the tag is removed before the frame is sent to the target end station. VLANs that are assigned on trunk or access ports without identification or a tag are called native or untagged frames.\nFor IEEE 802.1Q frames with tag information, the priority value from the header frame is used. For native frames, the default priority of the input port is used.\nEach port on the switch has a single receive queue buffer (the ingress port) for incoming traffic. When an untagged frame arrives, it is assigned the value of the port as its port default priority. You assign this value by using the CLI or CMS. A tagged frame continues to use its assigned CoS value when it passes through the ingress port."

This misconfiguration results in a packet loss and slowness, with increased packet loss when higher traffic rates occur on the link where the server is connected. For the clients who communicate with this server, the problem looks like slow interVLAN forwarding because they do not have a problem communicating to other devices or clients on the same VLAN. The problem occurs only when communicating to the server on a different VLAN. Thus, the problem occurred on a single collision domain, but is seen as slow interVLAN forwarding."

        "content": "A and C are the correct ones.\n\nExplanation: \nCollision Domains A collision domain is an area of a single LAN where end stations contend for access to the network because all end stations are connected to a shared physical medium. If two connected devices transmit onto the media at the same time, a collision occurs. When a collision occurs, a JAM signal is sent on the network, indicating that a collision has occurred and that devices should ignore any fragmented data associated with the collision. Both sending devices back off sending their data for a random amount and then try again if the medium is free for transmission. Therefore, collisions effectively delay transmission of data, lowering the effective throughput available to a device. The more devices that are attached to a collision domain, the greater the chances of collisions; this results in lower bandwidth and performance for each device attached to the collision\ndomain. Bridges and switches terminate the physical signal path of a collision domain, allowing you to segment separate collision domains, breaking them up into multiple smaller pieces to provide more bandwidth per user within the new collision domains formed."

    "body": "SIMULATION -<br><br>Lab OSPF -<br>A sporting goods manufacturer has decided to network three (3) locations to improve efficiency in inventory control. The routers have been named to reflect the location: Boston, Frankfurt, Lancaster. The necessary networking has been completed at each location, and the routers have been configured with single area<br>OSPF as the routing protocol. The Lancaster router was recently installed but connectivity is not complete because of incomplete routing tables. Identify and correct any problem you see in the configuration.<br>Note: The OSPF process must be configured to allow interfaces in specific subnets to participate in the routing process.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01501/0021700001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>",

Next notice that in the second \"network\" command the network and wildcard mask are 192.168.155.0 and 0.0.0.3 which is equivalent to 192.168.155.0 255.255.255.252 in term of subnet mask. Therefore, this subnetworks range is from 192.168.155.0 to 192.168.155.3 but the ip address of s0/0 interface of Boston router is 192.168.155.5 which dont belong to this range<br>-&gt; this is the reason why OSPF did not recognize s0 interface of Boston router as a part of area 0.

Flowbased analysis techniques may be utilized to visualize traffic patterns associated with individual routers and switches as well as on a network-wide basis (providing aggregate traffic or application based views) to provide proactive problem detection, efficient troubleshooting, and rapid problem resolution.<br>Application Monitoring and Profiling--NetFlow data enables network managers to gain a detailed, time based, view of application usage over the network. This information is used to plan, understand new services, and allocate network and application resources (e.g. Web server sizing and VoIP deployment) to responsively meet customer demands.<br>User Monitoring and Profiling--NetFlow data enables network engineers to gain detailed understanding of customer/user utilization of network and application resources. This information may then be utilized to efficiently plan and allocate access, backbone and application resources as well as to detect and resolve potential security and policy violations.<br>Network Planning--NetFlow can be used to capture data over a long period of time producing the opportunity to track and anticipate network growth and plan upgrades to increase the number of routing devices, ports, or higher-bandwidth interfaces. NetFlow services data optimizes network planning including peering, backbone upgrade planning, and routing policy planning. NetFlow helps to minimize the total cost of network operations while maximizing network performance, capacity, and reliability. NetFlow detects unwanted WAN traffic, validates bandwidth and Quality of Service (QOS) and allows the analysis of new network applications. NetFlow will give you valuable information to reduce the cost of operating your network.<br>Security Analysis--NetFlow identifies and classifies DDOS attacks, viruses and worms in real-time. Changes in network behavior indicate anomalies that are clearly demonstrated in NetFlow data. The data is also a valuable forensic tool to understand and replay the history of security incidents.<br>Accounting/Billing--NetFlow data provides fine-grained metering (e.g. flow data includes details such as IP addresses, packet and byte counts, timestamps, type- of-service and application ports, etc.) for highly flexible and detailed resource utilization accounting. Service providers may utilize the information for billing based on time-of-day, bandwidth usage, application usage, quality of service, etc. Enterprise customers may utilize the information for departmental charge-back or cost allocation for resource utilization.<br>NetFlow Data Warehousing and Data Mining--NetFlow data (or derived information) can be warehoused for later retrieval and analysis in support of proactive marketing and customer service programs (e.g. figure out which applications and services are being utilized by internal and external users and target them for improved service, advertising, etc.). In addition, NetFlow data gives Market Researchers access to the \"who\", \"what\", \"where\", and \"how long\" information relevant to enterprises and service providers.",

The answer is A because the other priorities are lower than root 16384.

In this case the option is A.\n\nIf a switch HAD the bridge priority of 8192, it WOULD be the primary switch instead tertiary one.\n\nIn other words, the CURRENT primary and secondary switches have the priority of 16384, and NO switch has the priority lower than 16384. Therefore,  the tertiary switch has the priority of 20480."

The default Ethernet VLAN is VLAN 1. It is a security best practice to configure all the ports on all switches to be associated with VLANs other than VLAN 1. \n\nThis is usually done by configuring all unused ports to a black hole VLAN that is not used for anything on the network. All used ports are associated with VLANs distinct from VLAN 1 and distinct from the black hole VLAN. It is also a good practice to shut down unused switch ports to prevent unauthorized access."

Each VLAN must have its own root bridge because each VLAN is a separate broadcast domain. The roots for the different VLANs can all reside in a single switch or in various switches.\u201d\n\nReference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/5234-5.html"

BGP is very strict in the routing advertisements. In other words, BGP only advertises the network which exists exactly in the routing table (in this case network x.x.x.32/27 exists in the routing table as the Fa0/0 interface). If you put the command \u201cnetwork x.x.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0\u201d or \u201cnetwork x.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0\u201d or \u201cnetwork x.x.x.33 mask 255.255.255.255\u201d then BGP will not advertise anything.\n\nTherefore the full command in this question is \u201cnetwork 172.16.1.32 mask 255.255.255.224\u201d.\n\nFor more information about BGP configuration, please read our Basic BGP Configuration tutorial"

Spanning tree shuts down ports that are in a Port Fast-operational state if any BPDU is received on them. \n\nIn a valid configuration, Port Fast-enabled ports do not receive BPDUs. Receiving a BPDU on a Port Fast-enabled port means an invalid configuration, such as the connection of an unauthorized device, and the BPDU guard feature puts the port in the error-disabled state.
