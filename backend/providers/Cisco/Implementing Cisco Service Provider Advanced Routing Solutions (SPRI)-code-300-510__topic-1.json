This is actually pretty easy to know, because all three routers show OSPF configurations using the \"network\" command. This is only used in IOS-XE. IOS-XR enables interfaces under the area configuration in OSPF. So this configuration is NOT IOS-XR like Gi0v4ne said. It is IOS-XE"

Router 2 will use the N2 route (which has a next hop of Router 1).\n\n\nIf you don't believe me, PLEASE prove me wrong. I spent a few hours labbing this up. When IOS-XR was the ABR, it preferred the E2 route over the N2 route. This lines up with RFC 1587. When I used IOSv as the ABR, it preferred the N2 route over the E2 route (which lines up with RFC 3101).\n\nBy the way, in IOS-XE you can clearly see which RFC version is supported by using \"show ip ospf | in RFC\" - there is no such output for IOS-XR that I've found.

Hierarchical CLI allows for easier configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting of OSPF configurations. When configuration commands are displayed together in their hierarchical context, visual inspections are simplified. Hierarchical CLI is intrinsic for CLI inheritance to be supported.\n\nWith CLI inheritance support, you need not explicitly configure a parameter for an area or interface. In the software, the parameters of interfaces in the same area can be exclusively configured with a single command, or parameter values can be inherited from a higher hierarchical level\u2014such as from the area configuration level or the router ospf configuration levels.\nMore information: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5500/routing/71x/b-routing-cg-ncs5500-71x/b-routing-cg-ncs5500-71x_chapter_011.html#con_1059437"

MPLS must be configured - Segment routing can be implemented with or without MPLS, but traditionally, segment routing has been used with MPLS. However, the configuration of MPLS is not a prerequisite for segment routing itself; it's more about the data plane technology used to forward packets.\nD.
