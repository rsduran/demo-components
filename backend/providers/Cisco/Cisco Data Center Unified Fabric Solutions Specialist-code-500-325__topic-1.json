Since we all agree there's no clear guide showing us any of the given answers, I plan to go with A 8-10 on the exam. The newest guide says 10-12, as toolgeek pointed out below, meaning the one the exam writer used was probably just a notch below that at 8-10. Five to ten seems like an unnecessarily large range, and anyone deploying 5 or 6 UC servers would probably get a BE6k anyway."
