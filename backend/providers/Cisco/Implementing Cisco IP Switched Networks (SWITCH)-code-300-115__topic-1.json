    "answerDescription": "There are two ways to configure interVLAN routing in this case:<br>+ Use RouterC as a \"router on a stick\" and SwitchC as a pure Layer2 switch. Trunking must be established between RouterC and SwitchC.<br>+ Only use SwitchC for interVLAN routing without using RouterC, SwitchC should be configured as a Layer 3 switch (which supports ip routing function as a router). No trunking requires.<br>The question clearly states \"No trunking has been configured on RouterC\" so RouterC does not contribute to interVLAN routing of hosts H1 &amp; H2 -&gt; SwitchC must be configured as a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for interVLAN routing.<br>We should check the default gateways on H1 &amp; H2. Click on H1 and H2 and type the \"ipconfig\" command to get their default gateways.<br>\\&gt;ipconfig<br>We will get the default gateways as follows:<br>:<br><br>Host1 -<br>+ Default gateway: 190.200.250.33<br>:<br><br>Host2 -<br>+ Default gateway: 190.200.250.65<br>Now we have enough information to configure SwitchC (notice the EIGRP AS in this case is 650)<br>Note: VLAN2 and VLAN3 were created and gi0/10, gi0/11 interfaces were configured as access ports so we dont need to configure them in this sim.<br><br>SwitchC# configure terminal -<br><br>SwitchC(config)# int gi0/1 -<br>SwitchC(config-if)#no switchport -&gt; without using this command, the simulator does not let you assign IP address on Gi0/1 interface.<br>SwitchC(config-if)# ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0 -&gt;RouterC has used IP 10.10.10.1 so this is the lowest usable IP address.<br><br>SwitchC(config-if)# no shutdown -<br><br>SwitchC(config-if)# exit -<br><br>SwitchC(config)# int vlan 2 -<br>SwitchC(config-if)# ip address 190.200.250.33 255.255.255.224<br><br>SwitchC(config-if)# no shutdown -<br><br>SwitchC(config-if)# int vlan 3 -<br>SwitchC(config-if)# ip address 190.200.250.65 255.255.255.224<br><br>SwitchC(config-if)# no shutdown -<br><br>SwitchC(config-if)#exit -<br>SwitchC(config)# ip routing (Notice: MLS will not work without this command)<br>SwitchC(config)# router eigrp 65010<br>SwitchC(config-router)# network 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255<br>SwitchC(config-router)# network 190.200.250.32 0.0.0.31<br>SwitchC(config-router)# network 190.200.250.64 0.0.0.31<br>NOTE: THE ROUTER IS CORRECTLY CONFIGURED, so you will not miss within it in the exam, also dont modify/delete any port just do the above configuration.<br>Also some reports said the \"no auto-summary\" command can\u2019t be used in the simulator, in fact it is not necessary because the network 190.200.0.0/16 is not used anywhere else in this topology.<br>In order to complete the lab, you should expect the ping to SERVER to succeed from the MLS, and from the PCs as well.<br>Also make sure you use the correct EIGRP AS number (in the configuration above it is 650 but it will change when you take the exam) but we are not allowed to access RouterC so the only way to find out the EIGRP AS is to look at the exhibit above. If you use wrong AS number, no neighbor relationship is formed between<br>RouterC and SwitchC.<br>In fact, we are pretty sure instead of using two commands \"network 190.200.250.32 0.0.0.31\u2033 and \"network 190.200.250.64 0.0.0.31\u2033 we can use one simple command \"network 190.200.0.0\u2033 because it is the nature of distance vector routing protocol like EIGRP: only major networks need to be advertised; even without<br>\"no auto-summary\" command the network still works correctly. But in the exam the sim is just a flash based simulator so we should use two above commands, just for sure. But after finishing the configuration, we can use \"show run\" command to verify, only the summarized network 190.200.0.0 is shown.",

Infact, to disable VTP pruning on Sw4 (in Client mode) we also have to change to VTP Transparent mode so answer C can be understood as \u201cchange SW4 to Transparent mode\u201d so itis the best choice."

        "content": "I think correct answer is A.\nWe know that SW1 and SW2 are in server mode, SW4 - in client mode. SW1 is primary server. We can not create VLANs on switch in client mode at all, but only on primary server. When I attempt create private vlans in my lab on primary server I received:\n\n%Private VLANs can only be configured when VTP is in transparent/off modes in VTP version 1 or 2 and in server/transparent/off modes in VTP version 3 when pruning is turned off\n\nSo we must configure private vlans on SW1 previosly disabling pruning on it."
