The basic pattern of TDD is a five-step, repeating process:\n\n- Create a new test (adding it to existing tests, if they already exist). The idea here is to capture some requirement of the unit of application code you want to produce.\n- Run tests to see if any fail for unexpected reasons. If this happens, correct the tests. Note that expected failures, here, are acceptable (for example, if your new test fails because the function it is designed to test does not yet exist, that is an acceptable failure at this point).\n- Write application code to pass the new test. The rule here is to add nothing more to the application besides what is required to pass the test.\n- Run tests to see if any fail. If they do, correct the application code and try again.\n- Refactor and improve application code. Each time you do, re-run the tests and correct application code if you encounter any failures.\n\nI think the answers are B and E,"

Test fails: Of course, the test fails because you haven\u2019t written the part that works yet. The idea here is to think about the class or function you want and test for its intended output. This initial test failure shows you exactly where you should focus your code writing to get it to pass. This is like starting with your end state in mind, which is the most effective way to accomplish a goal.\nStep 3. Write some code: Write only the code needed to make the new function or class successfully pass. This is about efficiency and focus.\nStep 4. Test passes: The test now passes, and the code works.\nStep 5. Refactor: Clean up the code as necessary, removing any test stubs or hard-coded variables used in testing. Refine the code, if needed, for speed."

Why write tests for stuff you know isn\u2019t going to\npass? Isn\u2019t all of this testing just wasted effort? The benefit of this style of development is\nthat it starts with the end goal in mind, by defining success right away. The test you create is laser focused on the application\u2019s purpose and a clear outcome. Many programmers add too much to their code by trying to anticipate future needs or building in too much complexity for an otherwise simple problem. TDD works extremely well with the iterative nature of Agile development, with the side benefit of having plenty of test cases to show that the software works.\n\""

        "content": "A and C are correct. \n[..] If you have a team of developers working on a project, all writing new code or changing previously written code, losing those files could set you back weeks or months. Version control can protect your code by allowing changes to be checked in (through a process known as a code commit) to a hierarchical tree structure of folders with files in them. You often don\u2019t know what a developer might need to change or has changed, but the version control system does. Each check-in is tagged with who made the change and what the person changed within the code. Instead of using inefficient techniques such as file locking, a version control system handles concurrent check-ins, allowing two programmers to commit code at the same time. [..] Another aspect of a version control system is the ability to branch and merge code built independently. This is very useful if you are writing code on a part of an application that could conflict with another part written by another team.\nPage 170 CCNA DevNet (DEVASC) - 200-901"

Version control can protect your code by allowing changes to be checked in (through a process known as a code commit) to a hierarchical tree structure of folders with files in them. You often don\u2019t know what a developer might need to change or has changed, but the version control system does. Each check-in is tagged with who made the change and what the person changed within the code. Instead of using inefficient techniques such as file locking, a version control system handles concurrent check-ins, allowing two programmers to commit code at the same time. [..] Another aspect of a version control system is the ability to branch and merge code built independently. This is very useful if you are writing code on a part of an application that could conflict with another part written by another team.\nPage 170 CCNA DevNet (DEVASC) - 200-901"

They make it very easy and fast to store and retrieve a value by supplying a key to be used as an index for that value. Values: The values in a Python dictionary can be anything, and like lists the types don't have to be consistent. Keys: A dictionary's keys have an important restriction: Whatever you want to use as a key has to be immutable and hash-able. This means that you could use a tuple as a key (immutable), but not a list (mutable). Also note that all of the basic data types that you learned about previously (int, float, bool, str, bytes ) are immutable and can be used as dictionary keys. You create a dictionary by using curly braces {] , separating a key from its value with a colon : , and separating the key-value pairs with commas. You can access and update elements using indexing; however, instead of using numerical sequential index numbers, you use the key as the index. You can add new elements simply by assigning a value to a new key."

They can focus just on the assigned smaller task (this, it is claimed, counters the key assumption of The Mythical Man Month, making it actually possible to add more developers to a late software project without making it later still).\""

Following from this therefore, a function is defined for the task that is to be done repeatedly, and then invoked/called when the task should be done. Thus correct answer is C."

It reads a token from a local JSON file and posts the token to the DNAC URL.\n\nThe Python function in the exhibit appears to read a token from a local JSON file by calling the json.load() function and passing in the file name as an argument. Then it makes a POST request to a specific URL using the requests.post() function and passing in the URL, the token and headers as arguments. The script also sets verify=False in the post method which could indicate that it is skipping SSL/TLS verification.\n\nGiven the context of the question (DNAC) and the parameters passed to the post method, it can be inferred that the script is likely interacting with the Cisco DNA Center (DNAC) API and the token read from the local JSON file is an authentication token that the script is using to authenticate to the DNAC API."

YAML uses indentation; JSON uses brackets and braces\n\nYAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are both data serialization formats, which are used to store and transmit data. They both have similar functionality and are used for similar purposes, but there are some key differences between the two.\n\nOne of the main differences between YAML and JSON is in their data structure. YAML uses indentation to indicate the structure of the data, while JSON uses brackets and braces. In YAML, indentation is used to indicate the level of nesting of elements and to indicate the beginning and end of an object or an array. In JSON, brackets are used to define the beginning and end of an array, and braces are used to define the beginning and end of an object."

An API is usually synchronous when data or service availability, resources and connectivity are high and low latency is a requirement.\n \nAsynchronous APIs: \nAsynchronous APIs are also known as async APIs. With an asynchronous process, the availability of a resource, service or data store may not be immediate. The API may have to wait for a backend response. These APIs may provide a callback notification to the requester when the requested resource is ready. Asynchronous requests are useful in maintaining an application's functionality rather than tying up its resources waiting on a request. An API may be asynchronous where data or service availability and connectivity is low or oversaturated with demand."

Auth/auth happens first.\nBoth A and C would produce a 401, as demonstrated by others.\nIn the absence of information suggesting otherwise, that leaves A as the most plausible since we know it produces a 401, and there's no indication that enough time has passed for the token to be expired."

The client is able to continue performing other actions or processes while it waits for a response from the server. This means that the client is able to handle multiple requests simultaneously, rather than having to wait for one request to be completed before moving on to the next.\n\nThe other options are not accurate. A synchronous or asynchronous API call may or may not require authentication, and there is no inherent difference in the offline capabilities or the number of calls that can be made in a specified time period between the two types of API calls."

If the API is designed correctly, the application will have better performance because everything happens quickly. However, if it is not designed correctly, the API request will be a bottleneck because the application has to wait for the response. \n\nWhen are APIs asynchronous?\nAPIs are usually designed to be asynchronous when the request is an action that takes some time for the server to process, or if the data is not readily available. For example, if the server has to make a request to a remote service to fetch the data, it cannot guarantee that it will receive the data immediately to send back to the client. Just because an API is asynchronous does not necessarily mean that the client will not get the data immediately. It only means that an immediate response with data is not guaranteed."

Representations of resources are distinct from the actual resources and may be provided in formats such as HTML, XML, or JSON."

Then they're accessed with a vault service. The only insecure part is the debugging. When the debugging happens, you can see the user/pass in the debugging logs. Technically, that makes B correct, as the logging is done after the HTTPS is decrypted, but it also makes C correct. However, the question asks what the issue is, not what the solution is.

The concept is simple. Think of asking someone \"tell me right away if X happens\".

These resources are identified by a URL and are defined within the API. For example, an API may define a resource called \"customers\", which can be accessed using the URL \"http://api.example.com/customers\". To retrieve a list of customers, the client could make a GET request to this URL. To create a new customer, the client could make a POST request to the same URL with the necessary data in the request body.\n\nIn contrast, in an RPC API, operations are performed by making function calls. The client makes a request to the server, specifying the function to be called and any necessary parameters. The server then executes the function and returns the result to the client. RPC APIs are operation-oriented, meaning that the focus is on the function being called rather than the resource being accessed."

These two port numbers do not have to be the same.\n\nFor example, if a service inside the container is listening on port 8080, and you want to access it from the host, you can expose that port on the host by using the -p option when starting the container. For example:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 mycontainer\n\nThis will expose port 8080 on the host, and any traffic sent to that port on the host will be forwarded to port 8080 inside the container."

This adds speed and precision to the process.\n\nSelf-service: Every IT engineer should have the same development environment to develop and test projects.\n\nCollaborative: The DevOps team needs to be united, work together, and help each other during the entire DevOps life cycle.\n\nHolistic: The DevOps process needs to be treated as a whole process, rather than just a couple of smaller tasks."

Each containerized application runs in its own isolated environment, with its dependencies encapsulated. This allows for independent operating systems for each application, efficient resource allocation, and easy deployment on servers with other applications installed.\n\nVirtual machines (option B) could also be used, but they are typically heavier in terms of resource usage compared to containers. Virtual machines provide a full operating system virtualization, which might be overkill if the goal is to have independent OS instances for each application.\n\nTherefore, based on the described requirements, containers (option C) are the most suitable deployment type."

Other version control systems, such as centralized version control systems, also allow users to work on the codebase while offline.\n\nIn contrast, option A, \"encourages users to commit small places of work to the system more frequently,\" is a benefit specific to DVCS.

One of the procedural components of a CI/CD pipeline is that every test must pass in order for the pipeline to continue its execution. If any test fails, the pipeline will stop and the issue must be addressed before the pipeline can continue. This is an important procedural component of a CI/CD pipeline because it ensures that the code being deployed is of high quality and meets the necessary standards before it is released."

This can be caused by a number of factors, including the distance between the user and the server, the number of intermediate routers or switches that the packets must pass through, and the overall condition of the network.

Security is not inherently associated with whether an IP address is private or public. Security measures are implemented independently, and both private and public IP addresses can be used in secure or insecure configurations.\n\nOption E is incorrect because private IP addresses are not controlled globally by an IP address registry.

Add \"member\" to the \"members\" list using \"self.members.append(member)\".\n\nBlank second field\nThis is the operation when the \"members\" list already contains \"member\".\nI think \"return True\" is correct since the \"members\" list already contains \"member\".\n\nThird blank\n\"if member\" checks that \"member\" is not a blank string or zero. Therefore, \"retrun False\" is correct because \"if member else\" fills in the operation when it is blank or 0.\n\nBlank fourth.\ndef add_member\" is a method of the \"Team\" class, so the correct answer is \"team.add.member(member member))\".\nI think \"team.add.member(member)\" is correct because \"team\" is an instantiation of \"Team\".\n\nTherefore\n1. \"self.members.append(member)\"\n2. \"retrun True\"\n3. \"return False\" \n4. team.add.member(member)\n\n\nIf you have other ideas, please comment."

The purpose of running the tests before writing code is to demonstrate that the tests fail for expected reasons. This is because the tests are written to test the functionality that the developer is about to add to the codebase, and since that functionality does not yet exist, the tests should fail. This is an important step in the TDD process because it confirms that the tests are correctly identifying the missing functionality and that they are not passing due to an error in the tests themselves."

When devices are grouped into a VLAN, they can communicate as if they are connected on the same wire, even if they are physically located on different parts of the network. This can be useful for reducing the number of physical cables needed and for improving network performance. However, there are other purposes for grouping devices in a VLAN as well, such as limiting multicast network traffic to the VLAN connected devices and controlling which devices can communicate with each other."

These resources are identified by a URL and are defined within the API. For example, an API may define a resource called \"customers\", which can be accessed using the URL \"http://api.example.com/customers\". To retrieve a list of customers, the client could make a GET request to this URL. To create a new customer, the client could make a POST request to the same URL with the necessary data in the request body.\n\nIn contrast, in an RPC API, operations are performed by making function calls. The client makes a request to the server, specifying the function to be called and any necessary parameters. The server then executes the function and returns the result to the client. RPC APIs are operation-oriented, meaning that the focus is on the function being called rather than the resource being accessed."

With a centralized workflow, there is a single central repository that serves as the authoritative source for the codebase. All team members push their changes to this central repository, and it is important that the repository's integrity is maintained. The central repository can maintain the latest working version of the codebase only if each team member's code changes are tracked and controlled. This feature helps prevent accidental or unauthorized modifications to the central codebase."

This can make it easier to maintain and update the application, as changes to the interface of one device will not affect the data or interface of the other devices."

Device-level management requires one controller per vendor and controller-level management does not.**\n\nIn device-level management, configurations and automation are handled individually on each device, and managing a large number of devices from multiple vendors can become challenging. This often requires different management solutions for each vendor. On the other hand, controller-level management (e.g., SDN controllers) centralizes control, allowing for easier management across devices from multiple vendors without needing separate controllers for each."
