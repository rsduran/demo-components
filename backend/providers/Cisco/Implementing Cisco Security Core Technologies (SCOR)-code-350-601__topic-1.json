    "answerDescription": "Bidirectional PIM is a different flavor of multicast than what you are probably used to (sparse, dense and sparse-dense mode). Most multicast networks have a couple of sources and many receivers. Bidirectional PIM has been invented for networks where we have many sources and receivers talking to each other. An example of this is videoconferencing where it's not just 1 source with many listeners but all the participants are communicating with each other.<br>The downside of using PIM sparse mode with many active sources and receivers is that we will see many mroute state entries that can take quite some resources. Using PIM sparse mode the RP builds 2 entries:<br>(*,G)<br>(S,G)<br>When we use PIM bidirectional mode the RP will never build a (S,G) entry and we only allow the (*,G) entry for the shared tree. PIM routers will never build the<br>SPT (Shortest Path Tree) towards the source.<br>Reference:<br>https://networklessons.com/multicast/multicast-bidirectional-pim",

The system with the lower MAC address wins as master and this election is not governed by the vPC role priority configuration.\n\nA re-election causes vPC LACP port-channels to re-initialize, which leads to a possible traffic outage.\n\nBefore you introduce an already isolated vPC device back into production, check the LACP roles on both boxes. If the same role, disable auto recovery with no auto-recovery under the vPC domain on both peers and reload the isolated device. After reload, the isolated device comes up with the LACP role 'none established' and can be introduced into the vPC without LACP role re-election."

This feature allows a pair of Cisco Nexus 7000 Series devices to appear as a single STP root in the Layer 2 topology. In the vPC peer switch mode, STP BPDUs are sent from both vPC peer devices. This behavior also avoids issues related to STP BPDU timeout on the downstream switches, which can cause traffic disruption. The vPC peer switch feature eliminates the need to pin the STP root to the vPC primary switch and improves vPC convergence if the vPC primary switch fails. It is important to note that the vPC peer switch is needed only when the STP root needs to be placed on the vPC pair of devices."

The recovering vPCs leg may black-hole routed traffic from access to aggregation/core until uplink Layer 3 connectivity is re-established. vPC Delay Restore feature delays vPCs leg bring-up on the recovering vPC peer device. vPC Delay Restore allows for Layer 3 routing protocols to converge before allowing any traffic on vPC leg. This results in a more graceful restoration and zero packet loss during the recovery phase (traffic still gets diverted on the alive vPC peer device). This feature is enabled by default with a vPC restoration default timer of 30 seconds. The timer can be tuned according to a specific Layer<br>3 convergence baseline from 1 to 3600 seconds.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ios-nx-os-software/nx-os-software/212589-understanding-vpc-election-process.html",

If one of the hosts connected to switch 4 sends either an unknown unicast or a broadcast, this traffic may get hashed to port eth2/2 on PortChannel 52. 5k02 receives the broadcast and needs to forward it to the peer link for the potential orphan ports on 5k01 to receive it.<br>Upon receiving the broadcast, 5k01 detects that this frame is coming from the vPC peer link. Therefore, it does not forward it to port 2/9 or 2/10; if it did, a duplicate frame on switch 3 or 4, respectively, would be created.<br>If a host on switch 4 sends a broadcast, 5k02 will correctly forward it to Po51 on port 2/9 and place it on the peer link. 5k01 will prevent this broadcast frame from exiting onto port 2/9 or 2/10 because this frame entered 5k01 from a vPC peer link. Should eth2/2 on switch 3 go down, port 2/9 on 5k01 would become an orphan port and as a result will receive traffic that traverses the peer link.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04312/0009500001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Reference:<br>https://www.cciein8weeks.com/courses/ccie-dc-400-151-v2-1-exam-cert-guide-3rd-edition/297/",

    "answerDescription": "About Telemetry -<br>Collecting data for analyzing and troubleshooting has always been an important aspect in monitoring the health of a network.<br>Cisco NX-OS provides several mechanisms such as SNMP, CLI, and Syslog to collect data from a network. These mechanisms have limitations that restrict automation and scale. One limitation is the use of the pull model, where the initial request for data from network elements originates from the client. The pull model does not scale when there is more than one network management station (NMS) in the network. With this model, the server sends data only when clients request it. To initiate such requests, continual manual intervention is required. This continual manual intervention makes the pull model inefficient.<br>A push model continuously streams data out of the network and notifies the client. Telemetry enables the push model, which provides near-real-time access to monitoring data.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-<br>OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x_chapter_011000.html",

Those characteristics can be their location in the chassis, or an attribute such as server type, amount of memory, local storage, type of CPU, or local drive configuration. You can manually assign a server to a server pool, or use server pool policies and server pool policy qualifications to automate the assignment.\n\nIf your system implements multitenancy through organizations, you can designate one or more server pools to be used by a specific organization. For example, a pool that includes all servers with two CPUs could be assigned to the Marketing organization, while all servers with 64 GB memory could be assigned to the Finance organization.\n\nA server pool can include servers from any chassis in the system. A given server can belong to multiple server pools."

All of these modes internally use the hardware compression engine in the module. Auto mode is enabled by default. Mode2 uses a larger batch size for compression than Auto-mode, which results in higher compression throughput. However, Mode2 incurs a small latency due to the compression throughput. For those deployments where aggressive throughput is most important, Mode2 can be used. Mode1 gives the best compression ratio when compared to all other modes. For those deployments where compression ratio is most important, Mode1 can be used."

Since only \"storage server traffic\" was mentioned, this leaves it ambiguous.  What if the the storage server traffic is using iSCSI or NFS protocols (like NetApp)?  Also, the N5K1 and N5K2 switches are presumably the old Nexus 5000 series switches, which had unified ports you can configure as Ethernet, FCoE or native FC.  Again, the question doesn't specifically state the protocol in use or mention FC or FCoE.  Choice B is the best answer in my opinion."

You can configure up to 64 RADIUS servers.\n\nNote\t\nBy default, when you configure a RADIUS server IP address or hostname of the Cisco NX-OS device, the RADIUS server is added to the default RADIUS server group. You can also add the RADIUS server to another RADIUS server group.\n\nNote \t\nThe local keyword is not supported (and is not required) when configuring AAA authentication groups because local authentication is the default if remote servers are unreachable. For example, if you configure aaa authentication login default group g1 , local authentication is tried if you are unable to authenticate using AAA group g1. In contrast, if you configure aaa authentication login default group g1 none , no authentication is performed if you are unable to authenticate using AAA group g1.\n\nWe have two Radius group default and Radius group."

In Release 3.1(3), light weight upgrade supports only security updates.\n\nWithin a service pack, updates may only apply to certain components.

HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) are not suitable for high-performance scenarios due to their slower speeds and higher latency.

The DHCP response including this option would tell the switch where to obtain its configuration file and system image.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Enable option 46.

Add Local CD/DVD and SAN Boot: When configuring the boot policy, you should add the SAN Boot option to the list of boot devices. This will allow the server to boot from the LUN on the Fibre Channel storage array. Additionally, adding the Local CD/DVD option can be useful for the initial installation of the operating system from a physical disc or an ISO image.\n\n\nD. Configure a SAN Boot Target with a WWPN: You need to specify the SAN boot target within the boot policy. This involves configuring the World Wide Port Name (WWPN) of the target port on the storage array and the LUN ID that the server should boot from. The WWPN is a unique identifier for the Fibre Channel port on the storage array, and the LUN ID specifies the logical unit number that has been provisioned for the server."

The data can be retrieved periodically (frequency-based) or only when a change occurs in any object on a specified path (event-based). You can use the NX-API to collect frequency-based data.\n\nData Encoding \u2014 The telemetry encoder encapsulates the collected data into the desired format for transporting.\n\nNX-OS encodes telemetry data in the Google Protocol Buffers (GPB) and JSON format.\n\nData Transport \u2014 NX-OS transports telemetry data using HTTP for JSON encoding and the Google remote procedure call (gRPC) protocol for GPB encoding. The gRPC receiver supports message sizes greater than 4 MB. (Telemetry data using HTTPS is also supported if a certificate is configured.)"

This means they can use the API to perform operations that not only read data but also add, edit, and delete data. These access rights are typically based on user-assigned roles such as Administrator that would have full rights to change data, whereas a plain User role might have read-only access rights.\n\nThe following list shows the types of authentication controls:\n\nNone: The Web API resource is public; anybody can place a call. Generally, the case for GET methods, rarely for POST, PUT, DELETE.\n\nBasic HTTP: The username and password are passed to the server in an encoded string.\n&lt;SNIP&gt;"

How do you track which user purchased what? You need to maintain a database with user accounts and user order history. But you don\u2019t want to maintain a user credentials database in-house.

It may be connected to another trunked N port (TN port) or trunked NP port (TNP port) to create a link between a core switch and an NPV switch or an HBA to carry tagged frames. TF ports expand the functionality of F ports to support VSAN trunking.\n\nIn TF port mode, all frames are transmitted in an EISL frame format, which contains VSAN information. Interconnected switches use the VSAN ID to multiplex traffic from one or more VSANs across the same physical link. This feature is referred to as VSAN trunking in Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches. TF ports support class 3 and class F service. \n\nC is the right one, is TN port not TNP"

When disruptive load balancing is enabled, FC NPV redistributes the server interfaces across all available NP uplinks when a new NP uplink becomes operational. To move a server interface from one NP uplink to another NP uplink, FC NPV forces reinitialization of the server interface so that the server performs a new login to the core switch.\n\nOnly server interfaces that are moved to a different uplink are reinitialized. A system message is generated for each server interface that is moved.\n\nNote\t\nRedistributing a server interface causes traffic disruption to the attached end devices. Adding a member to the existing port-channel does not trigger disruptive auto load-balance.\n\nTo avoid disruption of server traffic, you should enable this feature only after adding a new NP uplink, and then disable it again after the server interfaces have been redistributed.\n\nIf disruptive load balancing is not enabled, you can manually reinitialize some or all of the server interfaces to distribute server traffic to new NP uplink interfaces."

Set Link Group Preference to Port Channel.\nSetting the Link Group Preference to Port Channel ensures that the connections between the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects and the I/O modules are aggregated into a port channel. This configuration is crucial for meeting the requirement of using aggregation between the fabric interconnects and I/O modules. It helps in achieving redundancy and increasing bandwidth.\nB. Set IOM link pinning in Global Policies.\nSetting the IOM (I/O Module) link pinning in Global Policies ensures that the I/O modules are properly configured to use the required number of connections (in this case, four 10 GbE connections per I/O module). Pinning helps in maintaining consistent connectivity and managing how the links are distributed and aggregated."

Typical Linux methods and utilities like ifconfig and ethtool can be used to collect counters. When an interface is placed into a VRF in the NX-OS CLI, the Linux network interface is placed into a network namespace for that VRF. The name spaces can be seen at /var/run/netns and the ip netns utility can be used to run in the context of different namespaces. A couple of utilities, chvrf and vrfinfo , are provided as a convenience for running in a different namespace and getting information about which namespace/vrf a process is running in. \""

This feature eliminates the need to pin the STP root to the vPC primary switch and\nimproves vPC convergence if the vPC primary switch fails.\nTo avoid loops, the vPC peer link is excluded from the STP computation. In vPC peer switch mode, STP\nBPDUs are sent from both vPC peer devices to avoid issues related toSTP BPDU timeout on the downstream\nswitches, which can cause traffic disruption.\nThis feature can be used with the pure peer switch topology in which the devices all belong to the vPC."
