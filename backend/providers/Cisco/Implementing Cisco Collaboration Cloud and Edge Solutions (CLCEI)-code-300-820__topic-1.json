Since the station is initiating the connection to the outside via TCP/IP (with TLS on top), the signaling traffic will go through, and return traffic come back via the dynamic NAT from the firewall.  Has nothing to do with the traffic being \"always trusted\" though.  The media is a different story.  Media exchange would fail as the device would not be reachable from the outside without additional collaboration ifnrastructure unless you are using some form of static NAT.  So, the best answer here is A."

Expressway-C establishes an outgoing request to Expressway-E, enabling the Expressway-E in the DMZ to notify the internal Expressway-C of an incoming call from an external endpoint.\n\nIn a typical deployment scenario, Expressway-C, located within the corporate network, establishes an outgoing connection to Expressway-E, which is deployed in the DMZ. Expressway-E acts as the edge device and facilitates communication with external endpoints. When an external endpoint initiates a call, Expressway-E receives the call and notifies Expressway-C about the incoming call, allowing for secure communication between internal and external endpoints."

The engineer uses OAuth with refresh on the Cisco UCM SIP lines for extra security and improved user experience. During the setup, Mobile and Remote Access does not work, it is enabled on the Cisco UCM and Cisco Expressways. SIP trunks on ports 5090 and 5091 are configured to avoid conflicts with other SIP trunks between internal Cisco UCM clusters. The traversal zone also uses port 6500. The traversal zone between Expressways shows no errors, and the requests hit Expressway-E from the Internet. What is the reason that the solution does not work?",

It does this by first discovering all possible paths between the two endpoints, and then selecting the path with the lowest latency and jitter. ICE is used by many different applications, including WebRTC, SIP, and H.323.\n\nHere are the other options and why they are incorrect:\n\nA. B2BUA stands for \"Back-to-Back User Agent\". It is a type of SIP proxy that sits between two endpoints and relays messages between them. B2BUAs are often used to keep firewall ports opened for inbound/outbound calls, but they do not use ICE to do this.\nB. Mobile and Remote Access endpoints can connect video calls signaling peer-to-peer using a variety of protocols, including ICE. However, ICE is not the only protocol that can be used for this purpose.\nC. Calling external endpoints with reduced overhead under VPN connections can be done using a variety of methods, including ICE. However, ICE is not the only method that can be used for this purpose."

This ensures that the endpoints are always using the best possible media node cluster for their connection.\n\nA STUN test is a simple way to measure the round-trip delay time between two endpoints. It works by sending a message from one endpoint to the other and then measuring the time it takes for the message to return. This information can then be used to calculate the round-trip delay time between the two endpoints.\n\nThe round-trip delay time is an important factor in determining the quality of a media connection. A high round-trip delay time can cause audio and video to be choppy and out of sync. By performing a STUN test every 4 hours, Webex App endpoints can ensure that they are always using the best possible media node cluster for their connection. This helps to improve the quality of the media connection and the overall user experience."
