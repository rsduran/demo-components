    "answerDescription": "Validating user authentication should be implemented as close to the source as possible, with an emphasis on strong authentication for access from untrusted networks. Access rules should enforce policy deployed throughout the network with the following guidelines:<br>An integral part of identity and access control deployments is to allow only the necessary access. Highly distributed rules allow for greater granularity and scalability but, unfortunately, increase the management complexity. On the other hand, centralized rule deployment eases management but lacks flexibility and scalability.<br>Practicing \"defense in depth\" by using security mechanisms that back each other up is an important concept to understand. For example, the perimeter Internet routers should use ACLs to filter packets in addition to the firewall inspecting packets at a deeper level.<br>Cisco Press CCDA 640-864 Official Certification Guide Fourth Edition, Chapter 13<br><br>Exam E -<br><br>QUESTION 1 -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26421200008.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Select and Place:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26421200023.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26421200018.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Section:<br><br>Explanation -<br><br>Large-Building LANs -<br>Large-building LANs are segmented by floors or departments.

ACLs<br>+ congestion avoidance. WRED<br>+ traffic conditioners: CAR<br>+ congestion management: LLQ<br>+ link efficiency: LFI<br>Classication is the process of partitioning trafc into multiple priority levels or classes of service. Information in the frame or packet header is inspected, and the frames priority is determined.Marking is the process of changing the priority or class of service (CoS) setting within a frame or packet to indicate its classication.<br>Classication is usually performed with access control lists (ACL), QoS class maps, or route maps, using various match criteria.<br>Congestion-avoidance techniques monitor network trafc loads so that congestion can be anticipated and avoided before it becomes problematic. Congestion- avoidance techniques allow packets from streams identied as being eligible for early discard (those with lower priority) to be dropped when the queue is getting full. Congestion avoidance techniques provide preferential treatment for high priority trafc under congestion situations while maximizing network throughput and capacity utilization and minimizing packet loss and delay.<br>Weighted random early detection (WRED) is the Cisco implementation of the random early detection (RED) mechanism. WRED extends RED by using the IP<br><br>Precedence bits in the IP -<br>packet header to determine which trafc should be dropped; the drop-selection process is weighted by the IP precedence.<br>Traffic conditioner consists of policing and shaping. Policing either discards the packet or modies some aspect of it, such as its IP Precedence or CoS bits, when the policing agent determines that the packet meets a given criterion. In comparison, trafc shaping attempts to adjust the transmission rate of packets that match a certain criterion. Shaper typically delays excess trafc by using a buffer or queuing mechanism to hold packets and shape the ow when the sources data rate is higher than expected. For example, generic trafc shaping uses a weighted fair queue to  delay packets to shape the bw. Traffic conditioner is also referred to as<br>Committed Access Rate (CAR).<br>Congestion management includes two separate processes: queuing, which separates trafc into various queues or buffers, and scheduling, which decides from which queue trafc is to be sent next. There are two types of queues: the hardware queue (also called the transmit queue or TxQ) and software queues. Software queues schedule packets into the hardware queue based on the QoS requirements and include the following types: weighted fair queuing (WFQ), priority queuing<br>(PQ), custom queuing (CQ), class-based WFQ (CBWFQ), and low latency queuing (LLQ).<br>LLQ is also known as Priority QueuingClass-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (PQ-CBWFQ). LLQ provides a single priority but its preferred for VoIP networks because it can also congure guaranteed bandwidth for different classes of trafc queue. For example, all voice call trafc would be assigned to the priority queue, VoIP signaling and video would be assigned to a trafc class, FTP trafc would be assigned to a low-priority trafc class, and all other trafc would be assigned to a regular class.<br>Link efciency techniques, including link fragmentation and interleaving (LFI) and compression. LFI prevents small voice packets from being queued behind large data packets, which could lead to unacceptable delays on low-speed links. With LFI, the voice gateway fragments large packets into smaller equal-sized frames and interleaves them with small voice packets so that a voice packet does not have to wait until the entire large data packet is sent. LFI reduces and ensures a more predictable voice delay.<br>(Reference.

MIB (Management Information Base)<br>A MIB is nothing more than a database of objects. The MIB has a tree- like structure, similar to a file system. Each leaf object represents a parameter on the managed device. A common understanding of the MIB between NMSand agent is what allows SNMP communications to work. b. SNMP ( Simple Network Management Protocol)<br>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is the de facto standard network management protocol for the IP protocol suite. Developed in the late 1980s by the<br>IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), SNMP provides a simple means for vendors to provide management capabilities to their networking devices SNMP defines a manager/agent relationship for network management. A manager device essentially has two functions: monitor and control. It monitors network devices<br>(agents) by sending queries for performance, configuration, and status information. It controls agents by sending directives to change configuration parameters.<br>An example of an SNMP manager is an NMS (network management station) running CiscoWorks2000, while an agent might be a Cisco 7500 router. The NMS, acting as manager, communicates with the 7500, acting as agent, for information about its performance. SNMP is the protocol they use to communicate. An NMS can manage systems that include hosts, servers, routers, switches, hubs, UPSs, or most any network-attached device. The NMS runs the network management applications, such as CiscoWorks2000, that present management information to network managers and other users. The processing of SNMP is mostly performed by the NMS.<br><br>QUESTION 14 -<br><br>Data Center Design 3.0 -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26421200006.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Select and Place:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26421200024.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26421200036.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Section:<br><br>Explanation -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26421200032.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br> Unified computing<br> Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) is an innovative next-generation data center platform that converges computing, network, storage, and virtualization together into one system.<br> Integrates lossless 10GE unified network fabric with x86 architecture-based servers.<br> Allows for Cisco Virtual Interface Card to virtualize your network interfaces on your server.<br> Offers Cisco VN-Link virtualization.<br> Supports Extended Memory Technology patented by Cisco.<br> Increases productivity with just-in-time provisioning using service profiles.<br>In addition, the newer Data Center 3.0 architecture increases the overall return on investment (ROI) and lowers the total cost of ownership (TCO).<br> Virtualization<br> Virtual local-area network (VLAN), virtual storage-area network (VSAN), and virtual device contexts (VDC) help to segment the LAN, SAN, and network devices instances. for virtual machines (VM).<br> Flexible networking options with support for all server form factors and vendors, including support for blade servers from Cisco, Dell, IBM, and HP with integrated<br>Ethernet and Fibre Channel switches.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26421200043.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>.

    "answerDescription": "Section: Design Methodologies Explanation<br><br>NetFlow and NetworkBased Application Recognition (NBAR) both use Transport layer information to identify a traffic flow. NetFlow is a Cisco IOS feature that can be used to gather flow-based statistics such as packet counts, byte counts, and protocol distribution. A device configured with NetFlow examines packets for select Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Network layer and Transport layer attributes that uniquely identify each traffic flow. The data gathered by NetFlow is typically exported to management software. You can then analyze the data to facilitate network planning, customer billing, and traffic engineering. For example,<br>NetFlow can be used to obtain information about the types of applications generating traffic flows through a router.<br>A traffic flow can be identified based on the unique combination of the following seven attributes:<br>\u2711 Source IP address<br>\u2711 Destination IP address<br>\u2711 Source port number<br>\u2711 Destination port number<br>\u2711 Protocol value<br>\u2711 Type of Service (ToS) value<br>\u2711 Input interface<br>Although NetFlow does not use Data Link layer information, such as a source Media Access Control (MAC) address, to identify a traffic flow, the input interface on a switch will be considered when identifying a traffic flow.<br>NBAR is a Quality of Service (QoS) feature that classifies application traffic that flows through a router interface. NBAR enables a router to perform deep packet inspection for all packets that pass through an NBARenabled interface. With deep packet inspection, an NBARenabled router can classify traffic based on the content of a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet, instead of just the network header information. In addition, NBAR provides statistical reporting relative to each recognized application.<br>Reference:<br>Cisco: Cisco IOS Switching Services Configuration Guide, Release 12.2: Capturing Traffic Data",

    "answerDescription": "Section: Addressing and Routing Protocols in an Existing Network Explanation<br><br>The smallest summarization for the three networks connected to RouterA is 172.16.1.0/22, which is equivalent to a network address of 172.16.1.0 and a subnet mask of 255.255.252.0. In this scenario, the Class B 172.16.0.0/16 network has been divided into 256 /24 subnets. Three of the first four subnets in the Class B range have been assigned to network interfaces on RouterA: 172.16.0.0/24, 172.16.1.0/24, and 172.16.3.0/24. Absent from the network assignments is the<br>172.16.2.0/24 subnet. However, there is no way to summarize the address range without including the 172.16.2.0/24 subnet. Therefore, the smallest summarization you can create would summarize four subnets into a single /22 subnet.<br>A /22 subnet creates 64 subnetworks capable of supporting 1,022 assignable host IP addresses each. The assignable address range of the 172.16.0.0/22 subnet begins with 172.16.0.1 and ends with 172.16.3.255. This range includes all possible assignable IP addresses in the /24 subnets that are directly connected to<br>RouterA. It also includes all possible assignable IP addresses in the 172.16.2.0/24 subnet.<br>Subnetting a contiguous address range in structured, hierarchical fashion enables routers to maintain smaller routing tables and eases administrative burden when troubleshooting. Conversely, a discontiguous IP version 4 (IPv4) addressing scheme can cause routing tables to bloat because the subnets cannot be summarized. Summarization minimizes the size of routing tables and advertisements and reduces a router's processor and memory requirements.<br>Summarizing the three /24 networks with a /16 subnet would create too large of a summarization, because the /16 subnet contains the entire Class B range of<br>172.16.0.0 IP addresses. The first assignable IP address in the 172.16.0.0/16 range is 172.16.0.1. The last assignable IP address is 172.16.255.255. The range would therefore summarize 256 /24 subnets, not four.<br>Summarizing the three /24 networks with a /18 subnet would create too large of a summarization. A /18 subnet creates four possible subnets containing 16,382 assignable host IP addresses each. The first assignable IP address in the 172.16.0.0/18 range is 172.16.0.1. The last assignable IP address is 172.16.63.255.<br>The range would therefore summarize 64 /24 subnets, not four.<br>Summarizing the three /24 networks with a /23 subnet would create too small of a summarization. A /23 subnet creates 128 possible subnets containing 510 assignable host IP addresses each. The first assignable IP address in the 172.16.0.0/23 range is 172.16.0.1. The last assignable IP address is 172.16.1.255. This range would therefore exclude the 172.16.3.0/24 subnet connected to RouterA.<br>Summarizing the three /24 networks with a /25 subnet would not work, because a /25 subnet divides the 172.16.0.0/24 subnet instead of summarizing. A /25 subnet creates 512 possible subnets containing 126 assignable host IP addresses each. The first assignable IP address in the 172.16.0.0/25 range is 172.16.0.1.<br>The last assignable IP address is 172.16.0.127.

ACLs<br>+ congestion avoidance. WRED<br>+ traffic conditioners: CAR<br>+ congestion management: LLQ<br>+ link efficiency: LFI<br>Classication is the process of partitioning trafc into multiple priority levels or classes of service. Information in the frame or packet header is inspected, and the frames priority is determined.Marking is the process of changing the priority or class of service (CoS) setting within a frame or packet to indicate its classication.<br>Classication is usually performed with access control lists (ACL), QoS class maps, or route maps, using various match criteria.<br>Congestion-avoidance techniques monitor network trafc loads so that congestion can be anticipated and avoided before it becomes problematic. Congestion- avoidance techniques allow packets from streams identied as being eligible for early discard (those with lower priority) to be dropped when the queue is getting full. Congestion avoidance techniques provide preferential treatment for high priority trafc under congestion situations while maximizing network throughput and capacity utilization and minimizing packet loss and delay.<br>Weighted random early detection (WRED) is the Cisco implementation of the random early detection (RED) mechanism. WRED extends RED by using the IP<br><br>Precedence bits in the IP -<br>packet header to determine which trafc should be dropped; the drop-selection process is weighted by the IP precedence.<br>Traffic conditioner consists of policing and shaping. Policing either discards the packet or modies some aspect of it, such as its IP Precedence or CoS bits, when the policing agent determines that the packet meets a given criterion. In comparison, trafc shaping attempts to adjust the transmission rate of packets that match a certain criterion. Shaper typically delays excess trafc by using a buffer or queuing mechanism to hold packets and shape the ow when the sources data rate is higher than expected. For example, generic trafc shaping uses a weighted fair queue to  delay packets to shape the bw. Traffic conditioner is also referred to as<br>Committed Access Rate (CAR).<br>Congestion management includes two separate processes: queuing, which separates trafc into various queues or buffers, and scheduling, which decides from which queue trafc is to be sent next. There are two types of queues: the hardware queue (also called the transmit queue or TxQ) and software queues. Software queues schedule packets into the hardware queue based on the QoS requirements and include the following types: weighted fair queuing (WFQ), priority queuing<br>(PQ), custom queuing (CQ), class-based WFQ (CBWFQ), and low latency queuing (LLQ).<br>LLQ is also known as Priority QueuingClass-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (PQ-CBWFQ). LLQ provides a single priority but its preferred for VoIP networks because it can also congure guaranteed bandwidth for different classes of trafc queue. For example, all voice call trafc would be assigned to the priority queue, VoIP signaling and video would be assigned to a trafc class, FTP trafc would be assigned to a low-priority trafc class, and all other trafc would be assigned to a regular class.<br>Link efciency techniques, including link fragmentation and interleaving (LFI) and compression. LFI prevents small voice packets from being queued behind large data packets, which could lead to unacceptable delays on low-speed links. With LFI, the voice gateway fragments large packets into smaller equal-sized frames and interleaves them with small voice packets so that a voice packet does not have to wait until the entire large data packet is sent. LFI reduces and ensures a more predictable voice delay.<br>(Reference.

MIB (Management Information Base)<br>A MIB is nothing more than a database of objects. The MIB has a tree- like structure, similar to a file system. Each leaf object represents a parameter on the managed device. A common understanding of the MIB between NMSand agent is what allows SNMP communications to work. b. SNMP ( Simple Network Management Protocol)<br>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is the de facto standard network management protocol for the IP protocol suite. Developed in the late 1980s by the<br>IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), SNMP provides a simple means for vendors to provide management capabilities to their networking devices SNMP defines a manager/agent relationship for network management. A manager device essentially has two functions: monitor and control. It monitors network devices<br>(agents) by sending queries for performance, configuration, and status information. It controls agents by sending directives to change configuration parameters.<br>An example of an SNMP manager is an NMS (network management station) running CiscoWorks2000, while an agent might be a Cisco 7500 router. The NMS, acting as manager, communicates with the 7500, acting as agent, for information about its performance. SNMP is the protocol they use to communicate. An NMS can manage systems that include hosts, servers, routers, switches, hubs, UPSs, or most any network-attached device. The NMS runs the network management applications, such as CiscoWorks2000, that present management information to network managers and other users. The processing of SNMP is mostly performed by the NMS.<br><br>QUESTION 14 -<br><br>Data Center Design 3.0 -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400057.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Select and Place:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400020.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400009.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Section:<br><br>Explanation -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400067.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br> Unified computing<br> Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) is an innovative next-generation data center platform that converges computing, network, storage, and virtualization together into one system.<br> Integrates lossless 10GE unified network fabric with x86 architecture-based servers.<br> Allows for Cisco Virtual Interface Card to virtualize your network interfaces on your server.<br> Offers Cisco VN-Link virtualization.<br> Supports Extended Memory Technology patented by Cisco.<br> Increases productivity with just-in-time provisioning using service profiles.<br>In addition, the newer Data Center 3.0 architecture increases the overall return on investment (ROI) and lowers the total cost of ownership (TCO).<br> Virtualization<br> Virtual local-area network (VLAN), virtual storage-area network (VSAN), and virtual device contexts (VDC) help to segment the LAN, SAN, and network devices instances. for virtual machines (VM).<br> Flexible networking options with support for all server form factors and vendors, including support for blade servers from Cisco, Dell, IBM, and HP with integrated<br>Ethernet and Fibre Channel switches.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400063.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>.

The links between the access and distribution layers are configured as<br>Layer 2 trunks. The link between the distribution switches is configured as a Layer 3 routed link. An EtherChannel is typically used for this link to increase availability. In this design, there are no Layer 2 loops in the access-distribution block, which means that the Spanning Tree Protocol is not involved in network convergence and load balancing. All the ports are in the spanning-tree Forwarding state. Load balancing of the traffic from the access to the distribution layer is based on the First Hop Router Protocol (FHRP) that is used in this design. Reconvergence time in the case of failure is driven primarily by FHRP reconvergence.<br>A limitation of this solution is that it is optimal for networks where each access layer VLAN can be constrained to a single access switch. Stretching VLANs across multiple access switches is not recommended in this design.<br> Layer 2 looped design: The Layer 2 looped design also uses Layer 2 switching on the access layer, and the links between the access and distribution switches are also configured as Layer 2 trunks. However, unlike the Layer 2 loop-free design, the link between the distribution switches is configured here as a Layer 2 trunk. This configuration introduces a Layer 2 loop between the distribution switches and the access switches. To eliminate this loop from the topology, the<br>Spanning Tree Protocol blocks one of the uplinks from the access switch to the distribution switches. This design is recommended for networks that require an extension of VLANs across multiple access switches. A drawback is that network convergence in the case of failure is now dependent on spanning-tree convergence that is combined with FHRP convergence. Another downside is limited load balancing. PVST root election tuning can be used to balance traffic on a<br>VLAN-by-VLAN basis. However, within each VLAN, spanning tree always blocks one of the access switch uplinks.<br> Layer 3 routed design: The Layer 3 routed design uses Layer 3 routing on the access switches. All links between switches are configured as Layer 3 routed links. The advantage of this design is that it eliminates the Spanning Tree Protocol from the interswitch links. It is still enabled on edge ports to protect against user-induced loops, but it does not play a role in the network reconvergence in the access-distribution block. FHRPs are also eliminated from the design, because the default gateway for the end hosts now resides on the access switch instead of on the distribution switch. Network reconvergence behavior is determined solely by the routing protocol being used. Like the Layer 2 loop-free design, the Layer 3 routed design constrains VLANs to a single access switch. Also, this design does not allow VLANs to be extended across multiple access switches, and it requires more sophisticated hardware for the access switches.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400077.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>This WAS answer !!!!!<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Layer 2 between distribution and access layers, with a Layer 3 link between the distribution switches<br>-&gt; Support Layer 2 VLANs spanning multiple access layer switches across the distribution switches<br>Layer 2 between distribution and access layers, with a Layer 2 link between the distribution switches<br>-&gt; FHRP for convergence, no VLANs span between access layer switches across the distribution switches<br>VSS -&gt; Convergence (FHRP) is not an issue<br>The following are recommended best practices at the distribution layer:<br>Cisco Press CCDA 640-864 Official Certification Guide Fourth Edition, Chapter 3<br><br>QUESTION 12 -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400043.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Select and Place:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400015.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400060.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Section:<br><br>Explanation -<br><br>QUESTION 13 -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400085.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Select and Place:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400010.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400064.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Section:<br><br>Explanation -<br><br>QUESTION 14 -<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400037.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Select and Place:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400090.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01522/n26441400047.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Section:<br><br>Explanation -<br>Exam G",
