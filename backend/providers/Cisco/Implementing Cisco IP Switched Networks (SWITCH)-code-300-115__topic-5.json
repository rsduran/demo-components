The help command does not display all commands of the help system.<br>Scenario:<br>You work for SWITCH.com. They have just added a new switch (SwitchB) to the existing network as shown in the topology diagram. You have been tasked with completing the needed configuring of SwitchA and SwitchB.<br>RouterA is currently configured correctly and is providing the routing function for devices on SwitchA and SwitchB. SwitchA is currently configured correctly, but will need to be modified to support the addition of SwitchB. SwitchB has a minimal configuration. SwitchA and SwitchB use Cisco as the enable password.<br>All interface commands must be entered at the physical interface level.<br>When entering the range command, add a space between the interface numbers (e.g., fa0/1-2)<br>Configuration Requirements for SwitchA<br>\u2711 The VTP and STP configuration models on Switch A should not be modified.<br>\u2711 SwitchA needs to be the root switch for vlans 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23.<br>\u2711 All other vlans should be left at their default values.<br>Configuration Requirements for SwitchB<br>\u2711 Vlan21<br>- Name: Marketing<br>- will support two servers attached to fa0/9 and fa0/10<br>\u2711 Vlan22<br>- Name: Sales<br>- will support two servers attached to fa0/13 and fa0/14<br>\u2711 Vlan23<br>- Name: Engineering<br>- will support two servers attached to fa0/15 and fa0/16<br>\u2711 Access ports that connect to server should transition immediately to forwarding state upon detecting the connection of a device<br>\u2711 SwitchB VTP mode needs to be the same as SwitchA.<br>\u2711 SwitchB must operate in the same spanning tree mode as SwitchA.<br>\u2711 No routing is to be configured on SwitchB.<br>\u2711 Only the SVI Vlan 1 is to be configured and it is to use address 192.168.1.11/24.<br>Inter-switch Connectivity Configuration Requirements<br>\u2711 For operational and security reasons trunking should be unconditional and Vlans 1, 21, 22 and23 should be tagged when traversing the trunk link.<br>\u2711 The two trunks between SwitchA and SwitchB need to be configured in a mode that allows for the maximum use of their bandwidth for all vlans.

    "answerDescription": "The correct commands to load share the traffic using both links are: switchA(config)# interface fa0/2 switchA(config-if)# spanning-tree vlan 1-3 port-priority 16 switchA(config)# interface fa0/1 switchA(config-if)# spanning-tree vlan 4-6 port-priority 16<br>The configuration that was reflected in the exhibit in the show run output indicated that VLANs 1 through 6 were configured under both interfaces. However, the normal operation of STP will block one of the interfaces to prevent a loop. By default, all VLANs are allowed on both trunk links. Load sharing allows you to send some of the VLANs over one of the links and the rest on the other. In this case, the correct option will send VLANs 1-3 over Fa0/1 and VLANs 4-6 over Fa0/2.<br>By altering the port priority of the VLAN 1-3 on one interface and VLANs 4-6 on the other on the root bridge (Switch A) with the port-priority keyword, the behavior of STP is altered on the other switch. The port priority value must be set in increments of 16. Now Switch A will send VLANs 1-3 over one interface without blocking and 4-6 over the other interface without blocking. The additional benefit to this configuration is that if either link goes down, all VLANs can be sent over the remaining link and until the redundant link comes back up.<br>The commands below will have no effect because the default port priority is already 128, so the situation will remain the same: switchA(config)# interface fa0/1 switchA(config-if)# spanning-tree vlan 1-3 port-priority 128 switchA(config)# interface fa0/2 switchA(config-if)# spanning-tree vlan 4-6 port-priority 128<br>The commands below will have no effect because they omit the vlan 1-3 and vlan 4-6 parameters, and therefore change the port priority for all VLANs. Since the port priority is changed equally on both interfaces, there will be no load sharing as a result. More over the priority value is not entered in an increment of 16, which will generate an error message indicating that it must be set in increments of 16. switchA(config)# interface fa0/1 switchA(config-if)# spanning-tree port-priority 20 switchA(config)# interface fa0/2 switchA(config-if)# spanning-tree port-priority 20<br>Objective:<br><br>Layer 2 Technologies -<br>Sub-Objective:<br>Configure and verify spanning tree<br>References:<br>Cisco &gt; Home &gt; Support &gt; Technology Support &gt; LAN Switching &gt; Spanning Tree Protocol &gt; Design &gt; Design Technotes &gt; VLAN Load Balancing Between<br>Trunks Using the Spanning-Tree Protocol Port Priority<br>Cisco &gt; Cisco IOS LAN Switching Command Reference &gt; show vlan through ssl-proxy module allowed-vlan &gt; spanning-tree port-priority",

    "answer": "Explanation",
    "answerDescription": "It usually takes 50 seconds for a port to transition from the blocking state to the forwarding state in STP. This delay is a function of the default settings for the forward-delay and max-age settings. The max-age delay is 20 seconds by default, and is used to transition from the blocking to the listening state. The forward- delay setting is 15 seconds by default. This timer is used in the transition from the listening to learning states, and again for the transition from the learning to the forwarding state. These timers give STP time to gather the correct information about the network topology. While they can be modified to make convergence more efficient, the default settings work for most networks. To change the timers on all switches in the VTP domain, change the timer settings on the root bridge and the changes will be forwarded to the other switches.<br>To prevent switching loops, spanning tree transitions each port through several states whenever there is a change in the network topology. Each state is briefly defined as follows:<br>Blocking: In the blocking state, a port does not forward frames, learn information, or send information. A forwarding port is placed in the blocked state when the port senses an absence of BPDUs, which are sent in the interval defined by the hello timer (two seconds by default). If the blocked port does not detect a BPDU for the length of time defined in the max-age setting (20 seconds by default), the port will transition into the listening state.<br>Listening: In the listening state, a port receives traffic but does not send information. This is the first transitional state after the blocking state. No user data is forwarded at this time, but the switch is very busy. It is during this stage that the switch participates in the election of the root bridge, the designation of root ports on the non-root bridges, and the selection of designated ports on each segment. Ports that are designated or root ports will transition to the learning state after the time defined in the forward delay (15 seconds by default) has elapsed.<br>Learning: In the learning state, a switch port can add the MAC addresses that it has learned into its address table, but cannot forward user data. The switch port will remain in this state until the amount of time defined in the forward-delay setting has elapsed (15 seconds by default), at which time it will transition into the forwarding state.<br>Forwarding: In the forwarding state, a port is actively forwarding packets. It will remain in the forwarding state until it does not detect a BPDU within the defined hello time, at which time the port is placed in the blocking state and the process starts again.<br>NOTE: One of the issues that can adversely affect the operation of STP is a duplex mismatch between the NICs on either end of a link between two switches.<br>While this causes more of a performance problem than a loss of the link, the intermittent nature of the outage can cause one of the other links on the switch to transition into a forwarding state, as it may interpret this as a loss of connectivity. If one of the other links switches to forwarding and the link with the duplex mismatch comes back online (which could happen quickly), it can create a switching loop.<br>Objective:<br><br>Layer 2 Technologies -<br>Sub-Objective:<br>Configure and verify spanning tree<br>References:<br>Cisco &gt; Support &gt; Technology Support &gt; LAN Switching &gt; Spanning Tree Protocol &gt; Design &gt; Design Technotes &gt; Understanding and Tuning Spanning Tree<br>Protocol Timers &gt; Document ID: 19120<br>Cisco &gt; Support &gt; Technology Support &gt; LAN Switching &gt; Spanning Tree Protocol &gt; Design &gt; Design Technotes &gt; Spanning Tree Protocol Problems and Related<br>Design Considerations &gt; Document ID: 10566",

The attacker can create a packet with two 802.1Q VLAN headers on it (called double tagging) and send it to a switch. The switch port will strip off the first header and leave the second. The second header will be seen as the originating VLAN, allowing the attacker access to a VLAN they are not connected to. Executing the switchport mode access command on all non-trunk ports can help prevent this attack. Pruning the native VLAN from a trunk link can also help.<br>VLAN hopping is a security concern because it can be accomplished without the packet passing through a router and its security access lists. For this reason, private VLANs and VACLs should be used to secure access between VLANs. Techniques to prevent these attacks are:<br>Prevent automatic trunk configurations by explicitly turning off Dynamic Trunking Protocol on all unused ports<br>Place unused ports in a common unrouted VLAN<br>MAC spoofing is an attack that allows an attacking device to receive frames intended for a different host by changing an assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a networked device to a different one. Changing the assigned MAC address may allow the device to bypass access control lists on servers or routers, either hiding a computer on a network or allowing it to impersonate another computer.<br>A rogue device is a device attached to the network that is not under the control of the organization. This term is normally used to mean a wireless device, perhaps an access point that is not operating as a part of the company's infrastructure. Employees may bring their own access points and connect them to the network so they can use their computer wirelessly.

The two versions are not interoperable. To support version 2, all of the switches in a network need to be configured to run in VTP version 2.<br>To enable, or revert back to, VTP version 1 at the configuration prompt, use the following command: switch(config)# no vtp v2-mode<br>VTP version 2 offers some features that are not available in version 1.<br>Token Ring support: Version 2 provides the ability to support Token Ring LAN parameters, such as ring numbers and hop counts, used in Token Ring LAN switching and VLANs.<br>Unrecognized type, length, value (TLV) support: A version 2-enabled switch in server or client modes will propagate configuration changes to its other trunks, even for TLVs it is not able to parse.<br>Version-independent transparent mode: In version 1, a transparent mode switch checks the domain name and the version of a received VTP advertisement before forwarding it. Using version 2, it ignores the version when forwarding the advertisement.<br>Consistency checks: With version 2, the switch performs consistency checks of VLAN information, such as names and values, when new information is entered through the CLI or using SNMP. It does not do this when updating with information from a new advertisement.<br>Objective:<br><br>Layer 2 Technologies -<br>Sub-Objective:<br><br>Configure and verify trunking -<br>References:<br>Cisco &gt; Home &gt; Support &gt; Technology Support &gt; LAN Switching &gt; Virtual LANS/VLAN Trunking Protocol (VLANS/VTP) &gt; Design &gt; Design Technotes &gt;<br>Understanding VLAN Trunk Protocol (VTP)<br>Cisco &gt; Cisco IOS LAN Switching Command Reference &gt; udld through vtp v2-mode &gt; vtp",

    "answerDescription": "Support for automatic load balancing and support for multiple gateways are two features that are provided by Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) but not by<br>Hot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).<br>GLBP, HSRP, and VRRP provide a redundant and fault-tolerant solution in case of first-hop router failure in a network. The basic operation of these three protocols is the same. In all three protocols, a group of routers on the same LAN is formed. One of the routers is selected as the active router and another as the standby router. The router with the highest priority is automatically selected as the active router. If the active router fails, the standby router assumes the responsibilities of the active router. The role of the active router is to forward the packets from the hosts to the virtual router (default gateway).<br>GLBP provides automatic load balancing between multiple routers by configuring multiple MAC addresses but a single virtual IP address. Every active virtual forwarder (AVF) in the group is configured with the virtual IP address but with different MAC addresses. All such AVFs can then participate in the packet- forwarding process. Multiple gateways then can share the load. On the contrary, HSRP and VRRP do not support automatic load balancing. Both these protocols require additional configuration on all the routers that need to load balance. The additional configuration involves using multiple groups on the routers or assignment of different default gateways for the hosts.<br>Note that GLBP and VRRP are supported by both Cisco and non-Cisco routers, whereas, HSRP is supported only by Cisco routers.<br>Single active router and interface tracking both are supported by GLBP, HSRP, and VRRP.<br>Objective:<br><br>Infrastructure Services -<br>Sub-Objective:<br>Configure and verify first-hop redundancy protocols<br>References:<br>Home &gt; End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Products &gt; Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.2.T &gt; Product Literature &gt; White Papers &gt; GLBP Gateway Load Balancing<br>Protocol &gt; Information About Gateway Load Balancing Protocol<br>Home &gt; Support &gt; Technology Support &gt; IP &gt; IP Application Services &gt; Design &gt; Design Technotes &gt; Hot Standby Router Protocol Features and Functionality &gt;<br>HSRP Background and Operations &gt; HSRP Operation",

In this mode, Host B can send and receive frames with other promiscuous, isolated, or community ports assigned to the same privateVLAN. Therefore, frames can be exchanged with Hosts A or C. Hosts A and C are attached to isolated ports. Isolated ports are able to send frames to promiscuous ports but not to each other.<br>Isolated and promiscuous ports can be combined to achieve a desired level of separation between particular machines while still allowing required access to services. As another example, suppose that security policy dictated that Host A and Host C cannot communicate with one another, but both computers needed to access a database on Host B. The isolated ports keep them from communicating with one another, while the use of a promiscuous port to Host B allows them to access the database. Any other resources in the network that either machine needs access to should be therefore connected with a promiscuous port.<br>The third type of port is a community port.

    "answer": "Explanation",
    "answerDescription": "A key element of NSF is packet forwarding. In a Cisco networking device, packet forwarding is provided by Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF). CEF maintains the<br>FIB, and uses the FIB information that was current at the time of the switchover to continue forwarding packets during a switchover. This feature reduces traffic interruption during the switchover.<br>During normal NSF operation, CEF on the active supervisor engine synchronizes its current FIB and adjacency databases with the FIB and adjacency databases on the redundant supervisor engine. Upon switchover of the active supervisor engine, the redundant supervisor engine initially has FIB and adjacency databases that are mirror images of those that were current on the active supervisor engine. For platforms with intelligent modules, the modules will maintain the current forwarding information over a switchover. For platforms with forwarding engines, CEF will keep the forwarding engine on the redundant supervisor engine current with changes that are sent to it by CEF on the active supervisor engine. The modules or forwarding engines will be able to continue forwarding after a switchover as soon as the interfaces and a data path are available.<br>As the routing protocols start to repopulate the RIB on a prefix-by-prefix basis, the updates will cause prefix-by-prefix updates to CEF, which it uses to update the<br>FIB and adjacency databases. Existing and new entries will receive the new version (\"epoch\") number, indicating that they have been refreshed. The forwarding information is updated on the modules or forwarding engine during convergence. The supervisor engine signals when the RIB has converged. The software removes all FIB and adjacency entries that have an epoch older than the current switchover epoch. The FIB now represents the newest routing protocol forwarding information.",

    "answerDescription": "A key element of NSF is packet forwarding. In a Cisco networking device, packet forwarding is provided by Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF). CEF maintains the<br>FIB, and uses the FIB information that was current at the time of the switchover to continue forwarding packets during a switchover. This feature reduces traffic interruption during the switchover.<br>During normal NSF operation, CEF on the active supervisor engine synchronizes its current FIB and adjacency databases with the FIB and adjacency databases on the redundant supervisor engine. Upon switchover of the active supervisor engine, the redundant supervisor engine initially has FIB and adjacency databases that are mirror images of those that were current on the active supervisor engine. For platforms with intelligent modules, the modules will maintain the current forwarding information over a switchover. For platforms with forwarding engines, CEF will keep the forwarding engine on the redundant supervisor engine current with changes that are sent to it by CEF on the active supervisor engine. The modules or forwarding engines will be able to continue forwarding after a switchover as soon as the interfaces and a data path are available.<br>As the routing protocols start to repopulate the RIB on a prefix-by-prefix basis, the updates will cause prefix-by-prefix updates to CEF, which it uses to update the<br>FIB and adjacency databases. Existing and new entries will receive the new version (\"epoch\") number, indicating that they have been refreshed. The forwarding information is updated on the modules or forwarding engine during convergence. The supervisor engine signals when the RIB has converged. The software removes all FIB and adjacency entries that have an epoch older than the current switchover epoch. The FIB now represents the newest routing protocol forwarding information.",

All of the other span- ning tree instance information is contained in MSTP records (M- records), which are encapsu- lated within MST BPDUs. Because the MST BPDU carries information for all instances, the number of BPDUs that need to be processed to support multiple spanning tree instances is signifi- cantly reduced.<br>All MST instances within the same region share the same protocol timers, but each MST in- stance has its own topology parameters, such as root bridge ID, root path cost, and so forth. By default, all VLANs are assigned to the IST.<br>An MST instance is local to the region; for example, MST instance 1 in region A is independent of MST instance 1 in region B, even if regions A and B are interconnected.<br>A CIST is a collection of the ISTs in each MST region.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18886900002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>The CST interconnects the MST regions and single spanning trees.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18886900000.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Reference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12- 2SX/configuration/guide/book/spantree.html",

Logging in to SW1 and using the \"show vtp status\" command we see this:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18888000005.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>So we know that the VTP domain must be CCNP. This leaves only choice D and E. We also see from the topology diagram that eth 0/0 of the new switch connects to a PC in VLNA 100, so we know that this port must be an access port in VLAN 100, leaving only choice D as correct. Note that the VTP versions supported in this network are 1, 2, 3 so either VTP version 2 or 3 can be configured on the new switch.",
