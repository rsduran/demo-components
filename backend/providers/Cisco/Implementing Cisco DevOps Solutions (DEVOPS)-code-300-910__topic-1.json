Use different pipelines for each environment\n\nTo target the required environment for precheck validation in a CI/CD pipeline, using different pipelines for each environment is a common and effective practice. Each environment (e.g., development, staging, production) may have unique requirements and configurations.\n\nBy using different pipelines for each environment, you can tailor the precheck validation steps, test instances, and deployment procedures to the specific needs of that environment. This approach ensures that changes are validated in a controlled and environment-specific manner before being promoted to the next stage."

Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary of strings, using the params keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass key1=value1 and key2=value2 to httpbin.org/get, you would use the following code:\n\npayload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\nr = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)\nYou can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL:\n\nprint(r.url)\nhttps://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&amp;key1=value1"
