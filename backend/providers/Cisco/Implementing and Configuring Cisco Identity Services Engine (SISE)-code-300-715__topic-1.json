Low-impact mode uses authentication open but adds security on top of the framework was built in monitor mode. It uses a PACL on the switch port to permit critical traffic of certain endpoints, such as thin clients, to function prior to an attempted authentication. After the authentication, the authorization should provide specific access, unlike monitor mode, which is the same before and after authentication."

Both servers can \"optionally\" be added to a \"AAA server group\" (aaa group server radius NAME) that makes it possible to config the servers in a deterministic order. 1st server listed will be used first.

All Cisco switches and wireless controllers embedded with Cisco TrustSec technology support the assignment of SGTs. An SGT can be assigned dynamically or statically. Dynamic classification occurs via an authentication sequence, via 802.1x, MAB, or web \nauthentication. When authentication isn\u2019t available, static classification methods are necessary. In static classification the tag maps to some thing (an IP, subnet, VLAN, or interface) rather than relying on an authorization from the Cisco ISE. This process of assigning the SGT is defined as \u201cclassification.\u201d These classifications are then transported deeper into the network for policy enforcement.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/borderless networks/trustsec/C07-730151-00_overview_of_trustSec_og.pdf"

In this scenario, the switch port is configured as a multi-authentication port, and each IP phone is configured with a unique username and password to authenticate to the network. Once authenticated, each phone is assigned its own VLAN and network access policy based on its authentication credentials.\n\nOption A, allowing a hub with multiple clients connected, is also not applicable as hubs are not used in modern network architectures and port-based authentication does not work with hubs. \nOption C, preventing users with hypervisor, is not applicable as this configuration does not address hypervisor-based attacks.\nOption D, bypassing IP phone authentication, is not applicable as this configuration enables port-based authentication."

A switch port in MDA mode allows a single MAC address in each domain (that is, one phone and one endpoint behind the phone). It\u2019s important to note that link state cannot be relied on completely because the switch port has more than one device.\n\n\u25a0 Multiauthentication (Multi-Auth): Multi-Auth is an extension to MDA. It supports the dual-domain solution while allowing virtually unlimited endpoints to be in the DATA DOMAIN. Each endpoint is required to authenticate, and each authentication session on the port is managed separately. The IP Phone solutions described for MDA are also applicable in Multi-Auth mode.\""

Interestingly, it looks like PEAP only works with non-certificate credentials (as in \"not supported\", it can do it).\n\nThen there is EAP-TTLS: It happens that EAP-TLS can ONLY use PKI, the client device MUST have a certificate but this question is related to protecting both non-certificate attributes. EAP-TTLS works in a similar way to PEAP but adds certificate-as-a-credential support (just like EAP-TLS) while still encrypting non-certificate credentials.\nhttps://www.interlinknetworks.com/app_notes/eap-peap.htm (no, it is not a cisco site but it does provide an insight on the PEAP and EAP-TTLS view)"

PEAP and TTLS are both tunneling protocols that allow devices to authenticate to Cisco ISE even if they do not support native supplicants.\n\nThe other options are not correct.

The default profiler configuration is set to No CoA for the reauthentication setting.\n\nWhen the profiler is set to No CoA, it will not send a Change of Authorization (CoA) request to the network device when the endpoint's profile changes. This means that the endpoint will not be granted access to the network based on its new profile.\n\nTo fix this problem, the administrator needs to change the profiler configuration to send a CoA request when the endpoint's profile changes. This can be done by going to the Profiling tab in the Cisco ISE GUI and selecting the Reauthentication setting. The administrator then needs to select the Send CoA option.\n\nOnce this is done, the endpoints will be granted access to the network based on their new profile."

After that the client is going to be authenticated again the MAB authentication will be successful again, so this means that the user will be again redirected to the portal because is gonna match always the firts policy. What we must do is change the order of the policies. After that the user is gonna to authenticate then the CoA will be sent and another process for authentication will occur.

This means that profiling always happens after connecting the device (whether we do dot1x or MAB) and if Device Sensor (and then ISE) can't detect enough profiling data from DHCP and RADIUS Accounting, additional network access won't change the profiling situation. \nTo get more profiling data from endpoint communication, another ISE probes would have to be deployed (for ex. SNMP, NetFlow, etc...), which is totally out of scope of this question."

This means that if one node fails, the other nodes can continue to provide services.\n\nA dispersed deployment model is a type of distributed deployment model where the nodes are located in different geographical locations. This provides additional redundancy in case of a disaster at one location.\n\nA two-node deployment model is a type of distributed deployment model where there are only two nodes in the deployment. This is the simplest type of distributed deployment model, but it does not provide as much redundancy as a dispersed deployment model.\n\nA hybrid deployment model is a type of deployment model that combines elements of both distributed and standalone deployment models. This can be useful in cases where there are some nodes that need to be highly available and some nodes that do not."

There is no UI for the Stealth AnyConnect posture.  However, if you include other modules such as AMP Enabler or VPN, you will see the UI.

After you enable the SNMPQUERY probe, ISE polls all the SNMP-enabled NADs at the configured polling interval.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SNMPTRAP probe receives from the configured NAD(s) information that supports MAC notification, linkup, linkdown, and informs. The purpose of this probe is twofold: It is used to trigger the SNMPQUERY probe, and it is used as a toggle switch to allow the SNMPQUERY probe to reactively query a NAD instead of waiting for the periodic polling interval. Therefore, you must also enable the SNMPQUERY probe in order for SNMPTRAP to be functional. The SNMPTRAP probe receives information from a specific NAD(s) when the MAC address table changes or when the link state changes on a switch port. In order to make this feature functional, you must configure the NAD to send SNMP traps or inform.\u201d"

RSA SecurID two-factor authentication consists of the PIN of the user and an individually registered RSA SecurID token that generates single-use token codes based on a time code algorithm. A different token code is generated at fixed intervals (usually each at 30 or 60 seconds). The RSA SecurID server validates this dynamic authentication code. Each RSA SecurID token is unique, and it is not possible to predict the value of a future token based on past tokens. Thus, when a correct token code is supplied together with a PIN, there is a high degree of certainty that the person is a valid user. Therefore, RSA SecurID servers provide a more reliable authentication mechanism than conventional reusable passwords."

The Low-Impact mode is ideal for a Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot environments where thin clients have to download the operating system from the network before attempting network authentication.

Enable SNMP with read and write access on the Cisco WLC. This is because the Wireless Block List Default rule uses the ANC (Adaptive Network Control) action of QUARANTINE, which requires SNMP communication between the ISE and the WLC to apply the ACL named BLACKHOLE to the wireless device. If SNMP is not enabled or configured correctly on the WLC, the ISE will not be able to send the CoA (Change of Authorization) request to the WLC and the wireless device will not be blocked.\n\nThe other options are not correct. Option A is not relevant because URL redirection is not used for the Wireless Block List Default rule. Option C is not necessary because the ACL named BLACKHOLE is automatically created on the WLC when the ANC service is enabled on the ISE. Option D is not effective because the Access Type under the Authorization Profile only applies to wired devices, not wireless devices"

An example use case would be a critical network device such as a process control endpoint in a manufacturing facility, or a networked medical device in a healthcare facility. In these examples, the administrator may want to statically assign the endpoint to a policy.
