        "content": "TFTP Uses UDP Protocol\n\n\ndaniielkamau@gmail.com\nWhich protocol does tftp typically use for transport \n\nTFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) typically uses the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for transport. UDP is a connectionless protocol that allows for the transmission of data without establishing a dedicated end-to-end connection. This makes it suitable for use in simple file transfer applications like TFTP, where the primary focus is on transferring files rather than maintaining a reliable end-to-end connection.\n\nTFTP uses port 69 for both server and client connections. When a client initiates a connection to a TFTP server, it sends a request packet to the server's port 69, and the server responds with a packet containing the requested data or an error message if the request could not be fulfilled.\n\nTFTP is a simple protocol that is typically used for transferring files between devices on a local network. It is not as feature-rich as other file transfer protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), but it is easy to implement and requires minimal resources to run, making it suitable for use on resource-constrained devices."
