The reason is that the default configuration for Manual Fallback is for the Jabber client to apply the re-log in upper and lower limits for the fallback. These values can be modified in CUCM at System &gt; Service Parameters &gt; Set the Server as the Imp Server and set the service as Cisco Server Recovery Manager. \nThen look toward the bottom at Configure Re-Login limits. \nThe default value for Lower limit is 120 seconds. \nThe default value for Upper limit is 953 seconds. \nThis parameter prompts the Jabber client to log back into the services. \nThis works for both Manual and Automatic Fallback. \nAutomatic fallback is disabled by default, but can also be enabled by toggling true in the same service parameter as the Client Re-Login Upper and Lower Limit values. \n\nI tested it and it works. \nAlso - Manually rehoming the user to between publisher and subscriber also automatically logs the user into that node's respective services."

In pre-10 versions of IM and Presence, the user assignment was moved from one server to the other.  This user move was very expensive to server resources and added to the load that was on the server.  In 10.X and later, the user stays homed on the server that they are assigned to, and the backend user session in the Presence Engine is moved from the failed node to the functional node.  The user does not have to exit Jabber and re-log in when the change happens with Server Recovery Manager(SRM)."

The trancoding resource takes the incoming G.711 media stream from the ISP (loacted at the hub location) and transcodes to a G.729 media stream that is routed to an endpoint located at site B thus conserving WAN bandwidth.  There is no need to conserve WAN bandwith between the hub location and Site A therefore no need to transcode to G.729.  If you were to place the trancoding resource at SiteB you would be sending a G.711 call across the T1 link (low bandwidth issues etc) only to be trancoded at site B - thats not something you do in the real world."

The \"priority\" value in an SRV record enables administrators to prioritize one server that supports the given service over another. A server with a lower priority value will receive more traffic than other servers. However, the \"weight\" value is similar: a server with a higher weight will receive more traffic than other servers with the same priority.\n\nThe main difference between them is that priority is looked at first. If there are three servers, Server A, Server B, and Server C, and they have respective priorities of 10, 20, and 30, then their \"weight\" does not matter. The service will always query Server A first.\n\nBut suppose Servers A, B, and C all have a priority of 10 \u2014 how will a service choose between them? This is where weight becomes a factor: if Server A has a \"weight\" value of 5 and Servers B and C have a \"weight\" value of 3 and 2, Server A will receive the most traffic, Server B will receive the second-most traffic, and Server C the third-most."

Primary TFTP Server IPv4 Address (Option 150).\n\nIn a Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) environment, the server that provides the configuration files to the endpoints is the TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server. To configure DHCP service on the UCM, the engineer must specify the IP address of the TFTP server in the \"Primary TFTP Server IPv4 Address\" field, which is also referred to as \"Option 150\" in the DHCP protocol.\n\nOption A, \"Primary Router IPv4 Address,\" is used to specify the IP address of the default gateway, which is used by the endpoint to reach other devices on the network.\n\nOption C, \"Primary Start IPv4 Address,\" is used to specify the starting IP address of the DHCP address pool.\n\nOption D, \"Bootstrap Server IPv4 Address,\" is used in some legacy protocols to specify the server that provides configuration files to the endpoint during the boot process, but it is not used in a modern Cisco UCM environment."

MGCP is a master/slave protocol, where the Endpoint (Slave) is controlled by a Call Agent (Master) of some type. The entire control intelligence is controlled by a Master who instructs the endpoint what action to take once an event is detected. MGCP uses TCP port 2428 and UDP port 2427.\nTCP port 2428 in MGCP is used to open a new socket with the Call Agent to determine if the connection can be established. Without this new socket, subsequent MGCP Messages cannot be exchanged. It is also used to Send/Receive Backhaul Messages between PRI Endpoints and the Call Agent it is registered to. Finally, TCP port 2428 is used to failover to backup Call Agents in the event a Primary Call Agent is unresponsive.UDP Port 2427 in MGCP is used for MGCP Messages exchanged between the Endpoints and the Call Agents.\nBasic Flow"

After 25 seconds, the caller-phone hangs-on, furthermore I do not see a problem of call routing or some unallocated number or stuff like that, just a normal call clearing, is really the problem the \"011\" (even when the hanging-on side was the GW, no the CO)?, if it were the \"011\" issue, then it wouldn't have ringing and ringbacking for 25 seconds.

The same stuff if it is interworking H.323 with ISDN abut early media, we do not know. Whit the information provided by the question, it seems there is not failed call.

This is an important toll-fraud prevention setting, because inside facilitators can set up a conference call to expensive international numbers and then drop out of the call. Without the conference controller, international tariffs are billed back to the company in which the conference call was set up. Valid values are as follows:\n\n\u2014Never (default): The conference remains active after the conference controller and all on-net parties hang up. This default setting could result in potential toll fraud.\n\n\u2014When Conference Controller Leaves: Terminate the conference when the conference controller hangs up.\n\n\u2014When No On-Net Parties Remain in the Conference: Terminate the conference when there are no on-net parties remaining in the conference. This distinction is important because the conference controller might have to drop out of the call, but other business partners on the call should continue the conference. The When Conference Controller Leaves option would hang up the call when the conference controller left the conference."

Furthermore, prefixing of the number with \"+\" is called the globalized format of an E.164 number and is defined in the Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2806. The best practice, the incoming call must be globalized, next routed and finally Localized. Now, E.164 must be normalized to +E.164 on a globalized environment, for example, from a ISDN BRI, you do no need to prefix 011 for international call, just you can dial the E.164 format without access codes, and setting the TON to International but it is not globalization, so D can not be correct neither. If it were up to me, I would rather to choose C instead A."

Another think I would like to comment that E.164 number, in order to  ITU-T E.164, is a external called-party number (without \"+\").\nIf it is a External incoming call (from GW), calling- and called-party numbers are usually provided in localized E.164 format. If Called-party number is internal, A. could be the best answer. If Called-party number is external (offnet to offnet call), C. could be the best answer.\nIf it is a Internal Outgoing Call (from internal IP phone DN) to external Called-Party number change the called number to +E.164 format if any other format was used (according to local dial rules, enterprise access codes, etc.) and this case, the best answer could be C.\nIn order of all of above, the closest answer would be A because it has a more specific scenario (PSTN Gateway to Internal DN).

In addition to traffic classification, queuing and bandwidth provisioning also ensure voice and video quality. \n\nTherefore, QoS trust boundaries should be set up so that the switch will trust the QoS markings that phones place on their own packets. Layer 2 QoS uses a mechanism called class of service (CoS), which operates on the 802.1Q VLAN.\n\nBy default, QoS on a Cisco access switch is disabled. Once enabled, the switch does not trust QoS settings from a phone. Two simple commands can be entered under the global menu on a switch to enable QoS and change the trust boundary. Once it is enabled, you can use a show command to verify these settings. Example 13-1 illustrates the QoS enable and trust boundary commands and the show verification command."

For CBWFQ, you define traffic classes based on match criteria including protocols, access control lists (ACLs), and input interfaces. Packets satisfying the match criteria for a class constitute the traffic for that class. A queue is reserved for each class, and traffic belonging to a class is directed to the queue for that class."

This is particular important in environment where DNS configuration\nis handled by different organizational entities. Best use the NSLOOKUP from one of the Windows 7 PC to verify they can correctly resolve the SRV.\n\nBy default, the NSLOOKUP tool queries either DNS A records - mapping a name to an IP address or PTR records mapping IP address to DNS names. To use the tool to check SRV records,\n\nFirst start nslookup (on a windows client ) start the command prompt and then enter nslookup\nNext set the query type to SRV -&gt; set type = SRV\nAfter that insert the SRV record we need to check -&gt; _cisco-uds._tcp.example.com\nThis will return the DNS A records pointing to the CUCM servers."

Both of them match the dialed string, but 1XXX matches a total of 1000 strings (from 1000 to 1999) while 12XX matches only 100 strings (from 1200 to 1299).

In another words the smallest number of endpoints (strings that are configured on an endpoint) will be matched with this pattern.\nWhen I think about the answer D, it says the shortest explicit prefix, so the shortest Prefix in this example should be 1.XXX and not 12.XX (that is matched first).\nI don't know.

There is no indication of T1 vs E1, which normally only use outside of USA. \nC - is incorrect, the pri-group timeslot 1-10 cannot be 0-9 as \"0\" is not a valid number on Cisco IOS. \nD -  since this is only fractional T1 circuit 1-10,  by default IOS outbound calls are in descending order. All outbound calls will go out from bottom up(B-channel 23 and up) unless you manually configure the isdn busy b-channel XX to direct the IOS router not to sending calls out as a full T1 circuit.  Therefore by manually revert the order of using the channels will work in this case. Understanding doing so may create glare but this is beside the point for this question."

In this case, AF42 is typically used to mark streaming video traffic, which requires a moderate amount of bandwidth and a low to moderate level of delay and packet loss tolerance.

This is because video conferencing traffic requires a higher level of QoS to ensure good call quality, and is typically marked with a higher priority value such as AF41 or EF (Expedited Forwarding) to ensure that it receives the necessary bandwidth and low latency it needs to function well."

By randomly dropping packets prior to periods of high congestion, RED tells the packet source to decrease its transmission rate. WRED drops packets selectively based on IP precedence. Edge routers assign IP precedences to packets as they enter the network. (WRED is useful on any output interface where you expect to have congestion.

WFQ can also manage duplex data streams such as those between pairs of applications, and simplex data streams such as voice or video. There are two categories of WFQ sessions: high bandwidth and low bandwidth. Low-bandwidth traffic has effective priority over high-bandwidth traffic, and high-bandwidth traffic shares the transmission service proportionally according to assigned weights."

Low-bandwidth traffic has effective priority over high-bandwidth traffic, and high-bandwidth traffic shares the transmission service proportionally according to assigned weights.\n\nWhen WFQ is enabled for an interface, new messages for high-bandwidth traffic streams are discarded after the configured or default congestive messages threshold has been met. However, low-bandwidth conversations, which include control message conversations, continue to enqueue data. \n\nWith standard WFQ, packets are classified by flow. Packets with the same source IP address, destination IP address, source TCP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port, or destination TCP or UDP port belong to the same flow. WFQ allocates an equal share of the bandwidth to each flow. Flow-based WFQ is also called fair queueing because all flows are equally weighted.\n\nhttps://content.cisco.com/chapter.sjs?uri=/searchable/chapter/content/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_conmgt/configuration/15-mt/qos-conmgt-15-mt-book/qos-conmgt-cfg-wfq.html.xml#GUID-E0AB57ED-E7F8-4F2D-8F2D-FEC30D4E23B6"

Traffic that is adhering to a particular profile can be shaped to meet downstream requirements, which eliminates bottlenecks in topologies with data-rate mismatches. \n\nTraffic shaping regulates and smooths out the packet flow by imposing a maximum traffic rate for each port's egress queue. Packets that exceed the threshold are placed in the queue and are transmitted later. This process is similar to traffic policing; however, the packets are not dropped. Because packets are buffered, traffic shaping minimizes packet loss (based on the queue length), which provides a better traffic behavior for TCP traffic. \n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/qos/602_U1_1/b_3k_QoS_Config_602_U11/b_3k_QoS_Config_602_U11_chapter_0100.pdf"

Thus, this configuration aligns with the requirement to prioritize RFC2833 and then KPML."

The DSCP of traffic received from the PC is also re-marked to zero by default. Therefore, 'trust dscp' should be fine on your switch port. Also, you might want to configure 'mls qos trust device cisco-phone' so that DSCP is only trusted when a Cisco IP phone is plugged into the port."
