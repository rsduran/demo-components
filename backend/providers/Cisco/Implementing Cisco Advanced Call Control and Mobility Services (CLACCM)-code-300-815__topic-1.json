Without configuring audio capabilities, media negotiation cannot proceed correctly.\nWhile BFCP (Binary Floor Control Protocol) is important for scenarios involving conference control and content sharing, it is not typically required for basic media interworking scenarios like fast start-to-early media.\n\nSo, the revised correct answers should be:\n\nA.

Two of these extended capabilities are:\n\nBFCP (Binary Floor Control Protocol)\n\nAUDIO - This capability enables early media for audio streams, allowing audio to be transmitted even before the call is established. This allows users to hear ringback tones or announcements while waiting for the call to be connected.\n\nTherefore, options B (BFCP) and E (AUDIO) are the correct answers to this question.

This can cause the media to be sent to an incorrect or unreachable IP address, leading to one-way audio issues.

This allows the router or gateway to match SIP requests based on the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provided in the SIP message, making it an important criterion for incoming call handling. Other options like target carrier-id, answer-address, and incoming called-number are valid but generally used after the URI matching."

You determine that there is a firewall between the floors, and the administrator reports that it is allowing SIP signaling and UDP ports from 20000 to 22000 bidirectionally.

This command is necessary to begin configuring the CME gateway for SIP registration.\n\nvoice register global: This command is used after entering the VoIP configuration mode (voice service voip) and is specifically for configuring SIP phones in CME. It defines global parameters for SIP registrations, such as the maximum number of phones, system messages, and timers for SIP phones. While this command is essential for SIP phone configuration, it comes after you've initiated VoIP configuration with voice service voip.\n\nTherefore, voice service voip (B) is the top-level command needed to start the SIP configuration, and voice register global (C) is a subsequent step in configuring SIP phone registrations within CME."

The timeout keyword and argument set the interval length during which the call-park reminder ring is timed out or inactive. If the timeout keyword is not used, no reminder ring is sent to the extension that parked the call. The number of timeout intervals and reminder rings are configured with the limit keyword and argument. For example, a limit of 3 timeout intervals sends 2 reminder rings (interval 1, ring 1, interval 2, ring 2, interval 3). The timeout and limit keywords and arguments also set the maximum time that calls stay parked. For example, a timeout interval of 10 seconds and a limit of 5 timeout intervals (park-slot timeout 10 limit 5 ) will park calls for approximately 50 seconds."

To localize the called party numbers so that the + prefix will be replaced with the appropriate international code, for example for US Phone the + prefix is transformed to 011, for UK Phone the + prefix is replaced by 00, this is done by implementing Called Party Transformation Pattern for each egress PSTN gateway.\n  https://community.cisco.com/t5/collaboration-knowledge-base/globalized-call-routing-demystified-and-simplified/ta-p/4767793"
