This is because in the redistribute OSPF statement, BW metric has a higher value and delay has a value of 1. So, R2 chooses R4 over R1 for 10.1.1.0/24 subnet causing a loop.\nNow, R5 learns 10.1.1.0/24 from R3 and advertises the same route to R4, that R4 redistributes back in EIGRP. If R3 sets a tag of 1 while redistributing EIGRP in OSPF, and R4 denies all the OSPF routes with tag 1 while redistributing, it will not advertise 10.1.1.0/24 back into EIGRP.

To stop routing loops when mixing EIGRP and OSPF, we use route tagging and filtering. when a router sends routes from one type of routing (like EIGRP) into another (like OSPF), it adds a special tag to those routes. This tag is like a note that says, 'Hey, I came from EIGRP!' Then, when another router is moving routes back from OSPF into EIGRP, it looks for that tag. If it sees the tag, it knows not to send those routes back into EIGRP again. This way, we avoid having routes go in circles, causing loops. if router R3 is moving routes from EIGRP to OSPF, it tags them. Then, R4, which is moving routes the other way, blocks any routes with that tag from going back into EIGRP. So, R3 tags the EIGRP routes with a '1' when sending them to OSPF, and R4 makes sure not to let any routes with a '1' tag back into EIGRP."

With the focus on a routing change, the 'debug ip routing' command would be most suitable, as the change in the routing table would be clearly seen if it happens again, or it's flapping. This gives you greater visibility to the route changes. On the other hand, if you focus on the 'debug ip sla error', all you get is what you already know, that the ip sla got triggered. You don't get no added value by running that command. Hence the best option would be 'debug ip routing'."

Within OSPF AD=110. Reduce RIP down to 100 then on R2 10.1.1.0/24 will always point out towards RIP domain.\nAfter making lab you'll see that problem happens on R2; it redistributes RIP into EIGRP, which then gets redistributed into OSPF at R3. So R2 learns from R3 an OSPF E2 route with an AD of 110. It inserts 10.1.1.0/24 &gt;&gt; R3 into the RIB because the OSPF AD is lower than the RIP learned AD. \nThus lower RIP AD to 100 and it will be preferred over the OSPF route."

OSPF is learning the route from R4 via redistribution.\nRoute with the lover AD will be injected into the routing table.\nSo if RIP's AD will not be changed to 100, R2 will forward the traffic to R3, so the packet will not reach R1.\nI was confused a bit when I saw this scheme first time.

In other words, the router will use the PBR policy to determine where to forward the packet, regardless of whether the destination IP address is present in the RIB or not.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that forwarding packets using PBR rules that reference non-existent destinations can result in unexpected behavior and can lead to packet loss if the next-hop address specified in the PBR rule is not reachable. It's generally recommended to ensure that all destination IP addresses referenced in PBR rules are present in the RIB to avoid any unexpected packet drops."

As you probably already know, default-information originate tells the router to inject any default route that has been configured on the router into the OSPF. The OSPF router does not, by default, generate a default route into the OSPF domain.\nIn OSPF, the \u201cdefault-information originate\u201d command will not advertise to any other routers without a default route in the routing table. When added the \u201calways\u201d keyword , it tells the router to advertise a default route to other routers even if you don't have a default route in the routing table"

We could exclude R1 because it is better not to use an edge router as RR but I have not found any real reason to choose C in accordance with RR rules.

If you omit \"external,\" only OSPF internal routes (intra-area and inter-area routes) are redistributed by default.\n\nOption B and Option D suggest using a route-map to control the redistribution of OSPF external routes based on specific criteria defined in an access list or prefix list. While these are valid methods to control redistribution, they do not directly address the issue of missing OSPF routes in BGP. Option C, \"include the word internal external in the redistribute command,\" is not a standard syntax for redistribution and is not typically used in OSPF-to-BGP redistribution.\n\nSo, including the \"external\" keyword in the redistribute command is the most straightforward way to ensure that OSPF external routes are redistributed into BGP."

So when the advertised route from R4 is expired, the looped path is also expired soon and R3 willreinstall the main path from R4. This is the cause of intermittent connectivity.In order to solve this issue, we can lower the AD of iBGP to a value which is lower than 110 so that it is preferred over OSPF-advertised route."

This feature allows the network operator to configure a router to automatically identify and selectively dampen a local interface that is flapping. Dampening an interface removes the interface from the network until the interface stops flapping and becomes stable. Configuring the IP Event Dampening feature improves convergence times and stability throughout the network by isolating failures so that disturbances are not propagated. This, in turn, reduces the utilization of system processing resources by other devices in the network and improves overall network stability. \n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_pi/configuration/xe-16-11/iri-xe-16-11-book/iri-pi-event-damp.html"

Therefore R4 also learns about this subnet advertised from R2 with the same AD of 170.In the other hand, subnet 10.1.1.0/24 is also redistributed into OSPF on R3 so R5 &amp; R4 will learn about this subnet with AD of 110, which is better than the above AD of 170 so R4 will choose path R4 -&gt; R5 -&gt; R3 -&gt; R2 -&gt; R1.\nIn order to solve this problem, we can configure an outbound distribute list on R5 to prevent (filter out) this subnet from advertising to R4. Then R4 only has one way to reach R1, which is R4 -&gt; R2 -&gt; R1. But this method will remove the backup route so it is not the best solution.Another solution is to reduce the AD of the external EIGRP to a value smaller than 110.

Unlike traffic shaping, QoS policing avoids delays due to queuing. Policing is configured in bytes.\n\n+ Shaping: retains excess packets in a queue and then schedules the excess for later transmission over increments of time. When traffic reaches the maximum configured rate, additional packets are queued instead of being dropped to proceed later.

This is likely because iBGP requires a full-mesh configuration by default, meaning that R4 doesn\u2019t have a direct iBGP session with R1, and so it isn't learning the route to 192.168.100.0/24.\n\nSolution:\nTo fix this without needing full-mesh peering, R1 can be configured as a route reflector server, and R2 and R3 can be configured as route reflector clients. This way, R1 can reflect the route learned from R5 to the other routers in AS 65510, including R4.\n\nThe correct answer is: A\n\nA. Configure R1 as a route reflector server and configure R2 and R3 as route reflector clients.\n\nThis setup will ensure that R4 can learn the route to 192.168.100.0/24 from R1 through the route reflector mechanism."

Seq 10 matches on a specific range of ip's. Therefore traffic that doesnt match that range will move onto the next seq #, but in our case there is none so all other traffic hits the implicit deny at the end of the route map.

You can tell at then end of the exhibit where it receives  update from 192.168.1.1 (the OSPF RID of the hub router)  and sends a packet to the other spoke router. The OSPF's adjacencies are not forming. Why? By default GRE tunnel interfaces are POINT-TO-POINT  when enabled OSPF for a tunnel. In our case our spoke is trying to establish 2 adjacencies. One with the Hub router and one with the spoke. One adjacency is replacing the other, on the POINT-TO-POINT tunnel. So we need to make point-to-multipoint on our spoke. But if trying to form adjacency with other spoke, then other spoke is forming 2 adjacencies as well. so it needs point to multipoint as well."

So even if R1 was not a stub router, it would not advertise the route.\nOn top of that, we not only have to redistribute static routes into EIGRP, we also need to configure the eigrp stub to advertise static, as follows:\n\neigrp &lt;AS#&gt;\nredistribute static &lt;---This alone does not redistribute the static route\neigrp stub static    &lt;---This completes the static redistribute for a stub router\n\nB\nThere is not distribute-list into eigrp stub command. But what I think cisco meant was to create a prefix-list for R2 Loopback, reference it into a route-map, and tie that to a leak-map in eigrp, as follows:\n\nip prefix-list R2LOOP permit 2.2.2.2/32\n!\nroute-map R2LOOP permit\nmatch ip address prefix-list R2LOOP\n!\nrouter eigrp &lt;AS#&gt;\neigrp stub leak-map R2LOOP\n\nSo I think B is the best answer, as A is far too vague."

If all customer routes are being\nredistributed into MP-BGP, how does BGP handle identical network prefixes that belong to\ndifferent customers? It uses a route distinguisher (RD) to expand the customer\u2019s IP prefix so\nthat it includes a unique value that distinguishes it from the other identical prefixes. The RD\nis generated and used by the PE routers on a per-customer VRF instance basis, and to keep\nthings simple, the RD is used regardless of whether there are overlapping address spaces. So,\nthe RD is used all the time.\n\nThe unique 64-bit RD is prepended to the 32-bit customer prefix (IPv4 route) to create a\n96-bit unique prefix called a VPNv4 address, as shown in Figure 18-14.

With MPLS, we can configure \"maximum-path ibgp\" or \"maximum-path eibgp\", where the feature [ibgp] performs multipath forwarding only in PE-PE ibgp MPLS domain, and the feature [eibgp] can use both PE-PE ibgp and PE-CE ebgp domains for multipath calculations.

If both LDP peers initiate an LDP TCP connection, it might result in two concurrent TCP connections. To avoid this situation, an LSR first determines whether it should play the active or passive role in session establishment by comparing its own transport address with the transport address it obtains through the exchange of LDP Hellos. If its address has a higher value, it assumes the active role. Otherwise, it is passive. When an LSR plays the active role, it initiates a TCP connection to the LDP peer on the well-known LDP TCP port 646."

Consider the following scenario:\n\nR1 (VRF) --- Link in Area 1 --- R2 --- Link in Area 0 --- R3\n\nHere, R2 is obviously an ABR because it has two links, one in Area 0, the other in Area 1. R1 is, by all means, an internal router in Area 1. However, because R1 runs the link toward R2, and OSPF over this link, in a VRF, R1 considers itself to also be an ABR toward the MPLS Superbackbone."

Since the CE router acts as the PE router in VRF-lite, these checks should be disabled, because the PE routers advertise VPN routes with DN-bit set to the CE routers. If the CE routers receive routes with DN-bit set, it will discard them. Hence, the checks should be disabled."

You need to configure a domain name and then generate an RSA key to be able to SSH into the router.\n\nBut the question could also be interpreted as the router being the SSH client into some other device. The problem there is that such a setup would not require any configuration at all on the router. The device you SSH into might need it, but it might also need a bunch of other things. The most logical interpretation is in my opinion that we are trying to SSH into the router and it doesn't work, not that we are trying to SSH from the router. So the answer is B and C."

This is an excerpt from Cisco:\n\nhe CoPP feature on a Cisco device does exactly what it sounds like: It polices the traffic coming to the control plane. For this purpose, the control plane is treated as a logical source and destination, with its own inbound and outbound interfaces. Only traffic that is destined for the control plane is policed as part of this feature. This is in addition to any policing, filtering, or any other processing done at the interface where the packet was received by the device.\n\nSo, you police traffic coming to the Control Plane so that it doesn't have to process it.\n\nhttps://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2928193&amp;seqNum=3"

Therefore, the correct direction needs to be specified. For incoming packets, you specify input, and for outgoing packets you specify output. Direction can be verified with the output of show policy-map control-plane as well. Note that not all versions support output CoPP, and for the ones that do, you need to ensure that the correct traffic is being classified in the ACLs and the class maps. For example, when it comes to BGP, OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), and EIGRP, you typically use output CoPP for the replies that are being sent because of an already received packet. For ICMP, it would be error and informational reply messages. For Telnet, SSH (Secure Shell), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), or SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), you would be dealing with replies or traps. If the ACL and class map are not configured appropriately for the replies, the desired result will not be achieved.\nSo my guess is A."

So correct me if I'm wrong:\n1. You can use ACL to filter IP or MAC of rouge host generates RA. Downside of this is that if rouge router change IP or MAC, you have to change the ACL as well, which is not scale very well\n2. If we choose to filter based on Layer 2 destination MAC, which is multicast , IPV6 do not have broadcast. Then there is a chance that you accidentally block legitimate router RA ,because there is no difference between rouge router and legitimate router that generate RA.\nWith private VLAN , you just add rouge router on isolated port , legitimate router with promiscuous port , everything will automatically work"

The applied ACL on \"10 permit udp any eq snmp any\" is WRONG as it implies source port 161 to reach the actual router. This seems odd because the DESINATION port is actually 161 here and that one is listening on this actual router. To make the ACL actually match on inbound traffic hitting the SNMP server on this router, port 161 should be allowed as destination port as otherwise the management station cannot reach this router. Again, outbound traps should not be relavent for CoPP, if the traps overheat your CPU, it does not make a difference if they are blocked or not, the damage (high cpu) is already done. Summarazing here: the answer is D for sure as we need to allow inbound SNMP with having a destination port matching 161 == permit udep any any eq snmp (so the SNMP runs on the router, actually listening on that port) The management station is just a client in the dialog and generates a random source port."

So D doesnt change anything and thus incorrect\n\nSequence 5 in Answer B \"sequence 5 permit tcp host 2018:DB1:A:B::2 host 2018:DB1:A:C::1 eq telnet\" is the same again as Sequence 30 and has the same effect i.e., it doesn't change anything regarding the configs of  Default_Access ACL.

However, as long as it blocks the port on the STP level, loop guard blocks inconsistent ports on a per-VLAN basis (because of per-VLAN STP). That is, if BPDUs are not received on the trunk port for only one particular VLAN, only that VLAN is blocked (moved to loop-inconsistent STP state). For the same reason, if enabled on an EtherChannel interface, the entire channel is blocked for a particular VLAN, not just one link (because EtherChannel is regarded as one logical port from the STP point of view).\n\nOn which ports should the loop guard be enabled? The most obvious answer is on the blocking ports. However, this is not totally correct. Loop guard must be enabled on the non-designated ports (more precisely, on root and alternate ports) for all possible combinations of active topologies. As long as the loop guard is not a per-VLAN feature, the same (trunk) port might be designated for one VLAN and non-designated for the other. The possible failover scenarios should also be taken into account."

When this problem occurs, the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command displays output similar to what is shown in this figure."

Hashing, on the other hand, is one-way, meaning the plaintext is scrambled into a unique digest, through the use of a salt, that cannot be decrypted. Technically, hashing can be reversed, but the computational power needed to decrypt it makes decryption infeasible."

It provides uniform failure detection regardless of media type.\n\nBFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) is a protocol used for rapid failure detection in computer networks. One of its primary functions is to provide uniform and consistent failure detection regardless of the media type or technology being used in the network. BFD can be used with various network media types, including Ethernet, SONET/SDH, MPLS, and more. It ensures that failure detection is fast and consistent, making it a valuable tool for network reliability and fast convergence. Therefore, option C is the correct description of the function of BFD."

A transfer request is always initiated targeting port 69, but the data transfer ports are chosen independently by the sender and receiver during the transfer initialization. The ports are chosen at random according to the parameters of the networking stack, typically from the range of ephemeral ports.[4]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol"

Huntkey provided a nice resource of information, the RFC for TFTP provides explanation as to why this rule actually affects the connection between client and server.\nBased on the RFC, TFTP utilizes an ephemeral port named (TID, Transfer Identifier) that is used for the duration of the session. This TID is a random port between 0 to 65535. \nWhen a client sends a Write or Read request (WRQ and RRQ respectively), the Client chooses a TID at random, and sends the request to the server with destination port 69, this is allowed by the ACE #2 in the ACL.\nWhen the server receives the Request, it also chooses a TID at random, and uses that to send the ACK for a WRQ or a the first data packet for RRQ, but this communication is now continued between TIDs as the source/destination UDP ports. this is where the ACE#3 in the ACL is breaking the connection.\n\n1.- CLIENT (src.port.TID) ---(WRQ/RRQ)----&gt; (dst.port.69) TFTP\n2.- CLIENT (dst.port.TID) &lt;---(ACK/DATA)--- (src.port.TID) TFTP"

The flash-partition-number is the number of the specified partition number within the flash filesystem. If no partition is specified, the first partition is used. The filename is the name of the file that the TFTP service uses in answering read requests. The alias keyword allows you to provide an alternate name for the file."

OSPF uses this state only if neighbors are statically configured with neighbor command. In this situation, it does not have to discover them dynamically. As it already knows the neighbors, it will use unicast instead of multicast in this state.\n\nOnce neighborship is built, OSPF uses hello packets as keep alive. If a router does not receive a hello packet from any particular neighbor in dead interval, it will change its state to down from full. After changing the state it will make an effort to contact the neighbor by sending Hello packets. This effort is made in Attempt state.\n\nBasically Both Init and Attempt states describe similar situation where one router has sent a hello packet and waiting for response."

Once the modification is done, the new local pref or weight value will be applied when the traffic LEAVES the router.\n\nWording of the question is confusing but logically only these are correct options.\n\nTested in gns3 as well.

Is used to help in the overall IPsec throughput since the end host is able to avoid packet reassembly after packet decryption.\n\nCorrect: Pre-fragmentation (or Look-Ahead Fragmentation) helps improve IPsec throughput by ensuring that packets are fragmented before they are encrypted. This reduces the need for reassembly at the end host after decryption, leading to better performance and efficiency.\nE. Does not support Path MTU Discovery\n\nCorrect: IPsec pre-fragmentation does not support Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD). PMTUD is used to discover the maximum packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation, but pre-fragmentation is a different approach that works around the MTU issue by fragmenting packets before encryption."

In my opinion increase hold time feels like a band aid, if the link is unstable having a longer hold down time would not save the day. It might prevent many LDP sessions to be recreated, but it does not feel like something you would take to production. The link dampening seems to result in a more stable environment without any need for much LDP sessions to be re-created as a flapping link is taken out-of-service anyway.

The extened communities are not doing their job? Answer is yes they are, the point is that OSPF is smart! It undertand that there is something strange there and it will understand that the area 0 between the two CE routers is not a common area it smells that there is mpbgp there.... So this area will be transformed in a  SUPERBACKBONE AREA. By default this area will send type 3 LSAs even if it is an area 0"

Provider Edge (PE) routers, on the other hand, are routers located at the edge of a service provider's network and are responsible for connecting customer networks to the provider's network.\n\nSham links are generally not used between PE routers because they are not part of the OSPF routing domain within the provider's network. The PE routers are typically running a different routing protocol, such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), to exchange routing information with other provider routers and establish connectivity between customer networks.\n\nThe purpose of sham links is to establish connectivity and enable OSPF routing between non-adjacent areas within the OSPF routing domain. PE routers, being at the edge of the network, are not within the OSPF domain itself and are usually responsible for exchanging routing information with other networks using different protocols like BGP."

Area range should be applied on the ABRs when you are trying to summarize routes between OSPF areas. So area range is used to summarize Type 3 LSAs. On the other hand summary-address should be applied on the ASBRs when you are trying to summarize externally redistributed routes from another protocol domain (eigrp, bgp etc). So summary-address is used to summarize Type5/7 LSAs. One exception to this rule is when you have a NSSA area, the router that is responsible for the conversion of Type7 to Type 5 LSA can have the summary-address applied."

R1 learns 192.168.200.0 from R2 via OSPF. OSPF has AD 90 and RIP 120, so OSPF route become better than RIP route, but, for a route redistribution there is a rule that says the route must be in routing table and the source of redistribution must be the source of this route in route table, in this case, the RIP. When R1 learn this route in OSPF, the OSPF route replace the RIP route in route table, so the rule is broken and the redistribution stop working, then R1 stops redistribuing 192.168.200.0 to EIGRP and R2 stop reciving this route and R2 stops redistribute this route in OSPF so R1 won't recive this route from OSPF anymore, then OSPF route is removed from LSDB and RIB so RIP route go to the route table and the redistribution to EIGRP starts again and the problem starts over and over\n\nIf you redistribute RIP in OSPF in R1, R2 is gonna have this route as the best route from OSPF, so it does not matter if R2 learns it from EIGRP or NOT, because OSPF has AD 90 and External EIGRP 170."

This would result in a OSPF type 2 route. If you would have any route \"competing\" with another identical type 2 route, the more preferred route is a OSPF type 1 route, If you redistribute RIP on R1, and make the routes a type 1 route, they always have preference in the OSPF domain.\n\nThe answer fixes the problem but there are better solutions to solve this problem. In order of preference: There should be no redistribution from OSPF to EIGRP on R2 (option 1) OR only routes originating from EIGRP itself should be redistributed on R2 (option 2) OR you can lower the AD on RIP learned routes on R1 (option 3).\n\nMore info on OSPF path selection order: https://networklessons.com/ospf/ospf-path-selection-explained"

Since the deny statement comes before the permit statement in the route-map, the deny will take precedence.\n\nTherefore, even if you add a second sequence with \"permit 20,\" the deny sequence with \"deny 10\" is still in effect, and the routes for 1.1.1.0/24 would continue to be denied.\n\nTo achieve the desired result of allowing routes for 1.1.1.0/24 while still filtering other routes, you need to modify the existing deny sequence to permit the desired network.

If, for example, area 3 has address range 10.1.16.0/20, use network 10.1.16.0 0.0.15.255 area 3;\nIf the router has all interfaces in a single area, I would almost always use network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area area-id (unless there is an extremely good reason that some interfaces should not be seen by the OSPF process). \nCorrect answer is B ."

Instead of using the IP address of the Loopback0 interface, which is 10.10.10.5, it is using a different IP address.\nIn this case, it appears that the device with IP address 10.0.0.17 is using a different source IP address than the one expected by the device with IP address 10.0.0.18.\nSpecifically, the device with IP address 10.0.0.17 should be configured to use the IP address of its Loopback0 interface (10.10.10.5 in this case) as the source address for BGP updates when communicating with the device at IP address 10.0.0.18."

Also, R6 is using 10.0.0.18 for BGP communication with R5 and it's trying to open a session with R5's address 10.0.0.17. Which means:\n\nA - won't help, because then R6 will not respond as it's not using its Lo0 address for communication\nB - will help, because we remove Lo0 as update source from R5, so R6 can use R5's address 10.0.0.17 and R5 will reply\nC - won't help, because R6 is clearly not using Lo0 for communication, so this command is redundant\nD - won't help, because we would make R6 use R5's Lo0 address for communication, but we would also change R6's communication address too, so then there would be a mismatch with R5's neighbor config"

This is typically used on IDS appliances that connect to a single port on a switch only.\n\nRedistributed - Allows the advertisement of external EIGRP prefixes into the domain.\n\nStatic - Allows the advertisement of static routes into the network.\n\nSummary - Allows a summary route to be propagated across the network.\n\nCarriage Return - By pressing ENTER this will accept the default of connected and summary only."

The below figure helps you understand it:\n\nBGP_inaccessible_next_hop_self.jpg\n\nAlthough R2 keeps the next-hop 192.168.10.20 when advertising to R1 for network 10.0.0.0/8 but R1 does not know how to reach this next-hop so it is marked as inaccessible.\n\nAlso from the output \u201c192.168.10.20 (inaccessible) from 192.168.20.20\u201d, we learn that the IP address 192.168.10.20 was learned from 192.168.20.20 so this IP address belongs to R2 interface which is facing R1. Therefore the IP address of R1 interface which is facing R2 should be 192.168.20.10.\n\nOne solution of this problem is to set the command \u201cneighbor 192.168.20.10 next-hop-self\u201d on R2 so that R2 advertise its IP address as the next-hop for R1."

In this state, the\n\nneighboring routers establish a master/slave relationship and determine the initial database descriptor\n\n(DBD) sequence number to use while exchanging DBD packets.\n\nNeighbors Stuck in Exstart/Exchange State\n\nThe problem occurs most frequently when attempting to run OSPF between a Cisco router and another\n\nvendor\u2019s router. The problem occurs when the maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings for\n\nneighboring router interfaces don\u2019t match. If the router with the higher MTU sends a packet larger that\n\nthe MTU set on the neighboring router, the neighboring router ignores the packet."

The default-information originate option generates a type 7 default route for area 7, which can be used by R9 to reach the internet.

BGP route dampening is used to reduce the impact of such instability by suppressing routes that are frequently flapping. Neighbor route-map Dampening in: The key here is applying the dampening \"in\", which applies it to the incoming routes from the neighbor. This helps prevent the local router from flapping routes and constantly withdrawing them from the peers."

When the router has to forward a packet with a MPLS label on it, it will use the LFIB for forwarding decisions.\n\nI don't think E is accurate as if MPLS not enabled the Adjacency between the PEs will not form the start, my hint the question asking about already formed session and got broken."

When a packet reaches the device and there is not yet an adjacency for the destination or for the next hop, the NDP consults the device binding table to verify that the destination or the next hop has been previously gleaned.
