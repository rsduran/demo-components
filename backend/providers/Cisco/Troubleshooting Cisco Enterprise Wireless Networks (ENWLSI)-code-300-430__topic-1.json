This allows the AP to communicate directly with the FlexConnect controller without interference from other VLANs. Additionally, when configuring the switch port as an access port, ensure that the native VLAN on the switch port matches the VLAN assigned to the WLAN.\n\nIt is also important to configure the AP with the appropriate VLAN and SSID settings to ensure that it can communicate with the FlexConnect controller and provide wireless access to clients."

The user\u2019s experience at the home office is exactly the same as it would be at the corporate office. Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) encryption between the access point and the controller ensures that all communications have the highest level of security.Cisco OEAPs are designed to work behind a router or other gateway device that is using network address translation (NAT). NAT allows a device, such as a router, to act as an agent between the Internet (public) and a personal network (private), enabling an entire group of computers to be represented by a single IP address. There is no limit to the number of Cisco OEAPs that you can deploy behind a NAT device."

Depending on the configuration, you can:\n\nEnroll the Trustpoint automatically.\n\nThe Catalyst 9800 controller supports automatic certificate enrollment protocols like Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) and Enrollment over Secure Tunnel (EST) to forward and receive certificate requests generated on the controller to the CA.\n\nEnroll the Trustpoint manually.\n\nThe Catalyst 9800 controller supports manual enrollment that uses the PKCS#12 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) mechanism to issue certificates for the controller. Subsequent to the CSR request, the signed certificate for the controller, together with the CA root certificate, are uploaded to the controller. Note that it is also possible to use OpenSSL or any other utility to generate the keys and the CSR."

The IP address response is incorrect and can be ruled out because DHCP occurs after a 802.1x authentication when the client is in the run state (assuming no WebAuth). That leaves an invalid authentication policy on the authenticator which it could be if they didn't define the AAA settings properly. It could be an account lockout as the user will not be notified if it's locked. The final option is an invalid authentication policy on the authentication server.  All three of these could be right but I would choose the user account is locked because it says you are troubleshooting a user specific issue.  The misconfigured authenticator or authentication server would have widespread problems affecting multiple users wheras the individual user account being locked would explain a user specific problem."

This allows Cisco DNA Center to monitor the network for rogue access points effectively. When access switches are managed by Cisco DNA Center, it can detect unauthorized APs that are connected to the wired network and classify them as \"Rogue on Wire.\" This integration is crucial for proper rogue detection and classification in a Cisco SD-Access environment."

This value typically provides the user with a lower level of access, such as read-only, as opposed to full administrative access, which would be set by using the Administrative service type.\n\nBy setting the Service-Type to NAS Prompt, the user is granted read-only access to the WLC, which aligns with the requirement."
