HSRP version 1 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C07.AC00 to 0000.0C07.ACFF.\n\n\u2022Adds support for MD5 authentication.\n\nWhen you change the HSRP version, Cisco NX-OS reinitializes the group because it now has a new virtual MAC address.\n\nHSRP version 2 has a different packet format than HSRP version 1.
