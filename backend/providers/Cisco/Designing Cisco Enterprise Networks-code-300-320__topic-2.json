Policy can be enforced opportunistically at the ingress leaf; otherwise, it is enforced on the egress leaf. Whether or not policy can be enforced at ingress is determined by whether the destination EPG is known. The source EPG will always be known, and policy rules pertaining to that source as both an sEPG and a dEPG are always pushed to the appropriate leaf switch when an endpoint attaches. After policy is pushed to an leaf, it is stored and enforced in hardware. Because the Cisco APIC is aware of all EPGs and the endpoints assigned to them, the leaf to which the EPG is attached will always have all policies required and will never need to punt traffic to a controller, as might be the case in other systems. (See Figure 11).\n\nAnswer is definitely D"

The fastest mechanism by far is the integrated OAM mechanism of SONET/SDH framing. Other mechanisms include Loss of optical Signal (LOS), PPP keepalives, and various LMI mechanisms. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a generic lightweight hello-based mechanism that can be used in conjunction with any type of media.\n\nTherefore, BFD should be the correct answer."
