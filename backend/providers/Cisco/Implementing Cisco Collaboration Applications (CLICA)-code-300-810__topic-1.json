The Jabber client will apply the re-log in upper and lower limits for the fallback. \n\nAutomatic fallback is not the default configuration, but it can be enabled.

Here we can see the voice mail pilot is using the Null CSS which means the voice mail pilot can only reach numbers that are in the Null partition, ie directory numbers that have not been assigned a partition.  Clearly the Hunt Pilot number (which is used for presenting the call to Unity Cnx ) is assoaited with a partition, ie INTERNAL_PT.  So, in the above config the voice mail pilot would never be able to reach the Hunt Pilot number unless you gave the voice mail pilot a CSS that contained the INTERNAL_PT partition.  Answer D is close but i only mentions Phones.  The question is all about getting the call forwarded to voice mail via the Hunt Pilot and a SCCP port"

This means that if domain1 is different from domain4, you must configure the voice services domain in the Jabber client. This is because the domain portion of the login is used in order to discover the Collaboration Edge services using Service (SRV) record lookups.\n\nThe client performs a Domain Name System (DNS) SRV record query for _collab-edge._tls.&lt;domain&gt;. This implies that when the domain from the login user ID is different than the domain from the Expressway E, you must use the voice service domain configuration. Jabber uses this configuration in order to discover the Collaboration Edge and the UDS."
