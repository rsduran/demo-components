Is correct.\nThe major components of the Cisco vBond Orchestrator are:\nControl plane connection: Each Cisco vBond Orchestrator has a persistent control plane connection in the form of a DTLS tunnel with each Cisco vSmart Controller in its domain. In addition, the Cisco vBond Orchestrator uses DTLS connections to communicate with edge routers when they come online, to authenticate the router, and to facilitate the router's ability to join the network. Basic authentication of an edge router is done using certificates and RSA cryptography.\n\nNAT traversal: The Cisco vBond Orchestrator facilitates the initial orchestration between edge routers and Cisco vSmart Controllers when one or both of them are behind NAT devices. Standard peer-to-peer techniques are used to facilitate this orchestration.\n\nLoad balancing: In a domain with multiple Cisco vSmart Controllers, the Cisco vBond Orchestrator automatically performs load balancing of edge routers across the Cisco vSmart Controllers when routers come online.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/system-overview.html#c_Components_of_the_Viptela_SEN_9290.xml"

Without configuring max-control-connections to 0, BFD sessions will not form on the MPLS link.  The restrict option, while desirable, is not necessary.  Tunnels will attempt from mpls&lt;-&gt;biz-internet and will fail, but mpls&lt;-&gt;mpls and biz-internet&lt;-&gt;biz-internet tunnels will still form.\n\nPer Cisco Press's SD-WAN Book:\n\"When a WAN Edge attempts to join the fabric, it attempts to build control connections across each transport deployed at that site. By default, if a transport doesn\u2019t have control connectivity to any of the Cisco SD-WAN controllers, then it won\u2019t build a data plane connection across that transport either. This is very common with cloud deployments where the controllers are in a public or private cloud and your MPLS transport has no connectivity to the Internet.\"\n\nFollowed by this note:\n\"There are a few options to still achieve data plane with no control connectivity. One option is to disable control connections on that transport via the max-control-connections command. \""

Therefore, the NAT DIA route overwrites the OMP advertised default to prefer the local Internet exit, instead of taking the remote data centre Internet exit within a VPN."

The centralized control policy configuration itself remains on the vSmart controller and is never pushed to local routers.\nCentralized data policy applies to the flow of data traffic throughout the VPNs in the overlay network.

With graceful restart, if the vSmart controller in the network goes down, or if multiple vSmart controllers go down simultaneously, the vEdge routers can continue forwarding data traffic. They do this using the last known good information that they received from the vSmart controller. When a vSmart controller is again available, its DTLS connection to the vEdge router is re-established, and the vEdge router then receives updated, current network information from the vSmart controller."

All traffic exiting from the Cisco vEdge device, going either to other overlay network sites or to a public network, passes through this interface.\n\n    To direct data traffic from other VPNs to exit from the Cisco vEdge device directly to a public network, enable NAT in those VPNs or ensure that those VPNs have a route to VPN 0.\n\n    On the vCisco vSmart Controller, create a centralized data policy the redirects the desired data traffic from the non-transport VPN to VPN 0, and then apply that data policy to the non-transport VPN.

The new SAs are established before the old ones are deleted, ensuring continuous protection of data during the rekey process. Once the new SAs are fully operational, the old SAs are removed. This allows for uninterrupted and secure communication while maintaining a higher level of security by frequently refreshing the cryptographic keys."

This is referred to as grey list action at Umbrella Cloud.\nOne potential limitation in using intelligent proxy unicast IP addresses is the probability of the datacenter going down when the client is trying to send the traffic to the intelligent proxy unicast IP address. This is a scenario where a client has completed DNS resolution for a domain which falls under grey-listed domain and client\u2019s HTTP/(S) traffic is being sent to one of the obtained intelligent proxy unicast IP address.

Anyway C is the good answer for me. You should match Syslog servers before for sure, because if not 0.0.0.0/0 will match all your traffic before any kind of match.

This integration enables the enforcement of security policies, such as content filtering and blocking malicious domains, at the DNS level.\n\nOption A (L2TPv3 tunnel) and Option B (IPsec tunnel) are VPN tunneling technologies and are not directly related to delivering traffic to the Cisco Umbrella SIG cloud.\n\nOption D (source NAT) is a networking technique used for translating source IP addresses but is not specifically related to delivering traffic to the Cisco Umbrella SIG cloud."

These policies can include various aspects, such as application-aware firewall policies, Quality of Service (QoS) policies, VPN policies, security policies, and more.\n\nRoute Policy: Route policies are used to control the advertisement and acceptance of routes between different routing domains within the SD-WAN network. They help in controlling the flow of traffic and implementing traffic engineering decisions based on network conditions, link performance, and other criteria.\n\nThe other options (B. lists, C. QoS map, and D. policy-based routing) are not components of centralized policy deployment in vManage. While they may be relevant in other contexts or for specific configurations, they are not the primary components involved in deploying policies centrally within the Cisco SD-WAN solution."

These additional transport interfaces provide hardware-level transport redundancy at the local site. By configuring TLOC extensions, you can create redundant transport paths, allowing the WAN Edge router to switch to an alternate transport interface in case the primary one fails.\n\nRedundancy at the transport level ensures high availability and fault tolerance for the SD-WAN overlay network. If one transport interface becomes unavailable, the SD-WAN traffic can automatically failover to the alternate transport interface, ensuring continuous connectivity and minimizing downtime.\n\nThe other options do not accurately represent the main purpose of TLOC extensions:"

TLOCs represent transport interfaces on a WAN Edge router and are used for data plane traffic handling.\n\nB. Creates an IPsec tunnel from WAN Edge to vBond Orchestrator: TLOC extensions are not directly involved in creating IPsec tunnels to the vBond orchestrator. The vBond orchestrator plays a role in initial authentication and bootstrapping of WAN Edge routers but does not rely on TLOC extensions for IPsec tunnel creation.\n\nD. Transports control traffic to a redundant vSmart Controller: While TLOC extensions are used for data plane transport, they are not specifically responsible for transporting control traffic to redundant vSmart controllers. Control plane connectivity to vSmart controllers is established independently using other mechanisms such as the OMP (Overlay Management Protocol)."

When a WAN Edge router loses connection to the SD-WAN Controllers, the router can continue forwarding traffic using last known good routing information. The default OMP graceful restart value is 12 hours and can be set to a maximum of 604,800 seconds, which is equivalent to 7 days. The IPsec rekey timer is set to 24 hours by default, and although both timers are configurable, the IPsec rekey timer must be at least two times the value of the OMP graceful restart timer. This is because the SD-WAN Controllers distribute the IPsec keys to the WAN Edge routers, and if connections to the SD-WAN Controllers are lost, any IPsec rekeying that occurs within the graceful restart time would cause traffic loss."
