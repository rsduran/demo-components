In this case, the controllers are separate from the physical LAN, so they cannot provide any control over the LAN.\n\nFlexConnect is similar to a Centralized WLAN, with the added ability for the local AP to operate in Autonomous mode if the link to the controller fails. Neither the upstream controller or the local AP can control the physical LAN.\n\nAutonomous mode is a single AP acting as a standalone, and would have no access to the physical LAN."

It can receive multiple copies of the same signal and then combine them into one single signal that has a better SNR then the two individually received signals. In a nutshell though, this requires that a transmitter sends the original signal out from two or more transmitters, and that the receiver also receives multiple copies of the same signal and then tries to improve the received signal into a higher quality signal."

    "answerDescription": "The authentication process leaves two considerations: the access point (AP) still needs to authenticate itself to the client station (STA), and keys to encrypt the traffic need to be derived. The earlier EAP exchange or WPA2-PSK configuration has provided the shared secret key PMK (Pairwise Master Key). To derive the<br>PMK from the WPA-PSK, the PSK is put through PBKDF2-SHA1 as the cryptographic hash function. This key is, however, designed to last the entire session and should be exposed as little as possible. Therefore the four-way handshake is used to establish another key called the PTK (Pairwise Transient Key). The PTK is generated by concatenating the following attributes: PMK, AP nonce (ANonce), STA nonce (SNonce), AP MAC address, and STA MAC address. The product is then put through a pseudo random function. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004",

This associated MAC address is called the basic service set identifier (BSSID), and it enables stations to know which AP offers which SSID.",

This channel is 22 MHz wide (if the center frequency is<br>2.412, this channel spans from 2.401 GHz to 2.423 GHz) and does not move (no hopping, which is why the sequence is said to be direct instead of hopping).<br>Then, over this 22 MHz channel, several bits of information are sent in parallel.

But the issue is still that you cannot make the native vlan on the switch trunk port the same as the tagged vlan for MGMT on the WLC. The switch will drop any tagged frames coming in over the native vlan. Solution is to either make the Native Vlan something else, or make the MGMT vlan on the WLC as VLAN 0, which will be sent untagged to the switch and be processed under the native vlan (1) on the trunk port."
