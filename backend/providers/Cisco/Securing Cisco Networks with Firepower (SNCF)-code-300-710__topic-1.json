When the downed interface comes back up, the second interface automatically comes back up, also. In other words, if the link state of one interface changes, the device senses the change and updates the link state of the other interface to match it. Note that devices require up to 4 seconds to propagate link state changes. Link state propagation is especially useful in resilient network environments where routers are configured to reroute traffic automatically around network devices that are in a failure state."

For example, you can set up the cabling between the FTD and the network as if the FTD were inline and analyze the kinds of intrusion events the FTD generates. Based on the results, you can modify your intrusion policy and add the drop rules that best protect your network without impacting its efficiency. When you are ready to deploy the FTD inline, you can disable tap mode and begin dropping suspicious traffic without having to reconfigure the cabling between the FTD and the network."

Would they count this as a policy? Only the person who wrote the question knows. However, there are no Policies configured at all, that's why after you create your interface, you need to go and add your policy rules or it will be blocked by default. That's why I say it depends on what they are looking for with this question. Is there a \"deny ip any\" yes sure, but that's the default for everything and not only the DMZ, does it count as a policy? I don't think so, because when you go to the ACP it will tell you that you don't have any rules and you have to create a rule.\nWith that being said, I will go with the provided answer and pray for the best."

A transparent firewall, on the other hand, is a Layer 2 firewall that acts like a \u201cbump in the wire,\u201d or a \u201cstealth firewall,\u201d and is not seen as a router hop to connected devices. However, like any other firewall, access control between interfaces is controlled, and all of the usual firewall checks are in place. Layer 2 connectivity is achieved by using a \"bridge group\" where you group together the inside and outside interfaces for a network, and the Firepower Threat Defense device uses bridging techniques to pass traffic between the interfaces. Each bridge group includes a Bridge Virtual Interface (BVI) to which you assign an IP address on the network. You can have multiple bridge groups for multiple networks. In transparent mode, these bridge groups cannot communicate with each other"

Configure a trust policy for the CEO.\n\nA trust policy is a special type of access control policy that identifies trusted hosts and networks that are exempt from certain intrusion policies. By creating a trust policy for the CEO, the engineer can ensure that traffic coming from the CEO is always allowed, regardless of any other rules or policies that may be in place. This is a more targeted and specific solution than simply changing the intrusion policy or creating a general firewall bypass. NAT policies, while useful for translating IP addresses, do not provide the same level of control over traffic as access control policies."

According to the first sentence of the \"INTERFACE MODES AND TYPES\" section of The FMC configuration manual:  \n     \"You can deploy FTD interfaces in two modes: Regular firewall mode and IPS-only mode.\"   TAP mode would be an Advanced setting on an interface in IPS-only mode.\n\nIf this question is based on the FMC GUI, then there are three modes available. Two mode choices on Firewall mode interfaces. Default is mode:none, but mode can be set to passive mode, or ERSPAN mode.  There is one mode on an inline pair interface, \"Tap mode\" found in the advanced options.\n\nAnd to muddy the waters even more, ERSPAN could also be the correct answer because ERSPAN traffic is passive copies of traffic that doesnt go through the device, but the original traffic still has to go out somewhere, and that somewhere is probably through that ftd's firewall mode interfaces.  \n\nI'm undecided between IPS-only mode, and TAP mode."

A transparent firewall, on the other hand, is a Layer 2 firewall that acts like a \u201cbump in the wire,\u201d or a \u201cstealth firewall,\u201d and is not seen as a router hop to connected devices. However, like any other firewall, access control between interfaces is controlled, and all of the usual firewall checks are in place.\n\nLayer 2 connectivity is achieved by using a \"bridge group\" where you group together the inside and outside interfaces for a network, and the ASA uses bridging techniques to pass traffic between the interfaces. Each bridge group includes a Bridge Virtual Interface (BVI) to which you assign an IP address on the network. You can have multiple bridge groups for multiple networks. In transparent mode, these bridge groups cannot communicate with each other.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa97/configuration/general/asa-97-general-config/intro-fw.html"

However, it's important to note that ECMP is limited to multiple interfaces, not a single interface.\nNSR (Nonstop Forwarding) with BGPv4: Ensures continuous forwarding of traffic even during BGP process restarts or failovers, enhancing network resilience."

Malware analysis involves analyzing known malware to identify its characteristics and behavior, and this could also be useful in identifying unknown malware.\n\nHowever, sandbox analysis is generally considered to be a more comprehensive option for analyzing unknown files, as it involves executing the file in a controlled environment and monitoring its behavior to detect any malicious activity.\n\nSo while A could be a valid option in some cases, C, \"Sandbox analysis,\" is typically the more appropriate option for further analyzing unknown files in the Talos cloud."

Dynamic analysis is a security technique that involves executing files in a sandbox environment and observing their behavior to determine whether they are malicious.\n\nThe Cisco FMC supports dynamic analysis using its Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) feature, which includes a cloud-based sandbox for analyzing files. The AMP feature analyzes files in real-time to detect malware and other malicious activity.\n\nLocal malware analysis and spere analysis are not appropriate solutions for testing files for viruses on a sandbox system. Local malware analysis involves scanning files using antivirus software installed on the local system, which is not as effective as dynamic analysis. Sphere analysis involves analyzing files in a separate virtual environment, but it is not as comprehensive as dynamic analysis.\n\nCapacity handling is a general term that refers to the ability of a system to handle a large volume of traffic or data, and is not related to testing files for viruses on a sandbox system."

Use the Packet Capture feature to collect real-time network traffic.\n\nIn this scenario, since the FTD appliance utilization is peaking above 90% of total capacity, it is possible that the appliance is dropping packets and causing users to get disconnected from their corporate applications. To further analyze the issue, the network engineer can use the Packet Capture feature in the FTD to collect real-time network traffic and determine whether packets are being dropped, and if so, which packets are being dropped.\n\nOption A, Packet Export feature, allows you to export captured packets to an external storage device. It does not help in analyzing the issue at hand.\n\nOption C, Packet Tracer feature, is used to simulate and troubleshoot network traffic through the firewall. It does not help in capturing real-time network traffic for analysis.\n\nOption D, Packet Analysis feature, provides a way to analyze packet captures taken with the Packet Capture feature. However, before analysis can be done, packets must first be captured with the Packet Capture feature."

Therefore, the correct answer is D, Enable Automatic Application Bypass.\n\nWhen the SNORT inspection engine is overwhelmed, enabling Automatic Application Bypass allows the IPS to bypass specific applications or protocols that are causing the bottleneck. This ensures that critical traffic is not dropped, and network performance is not degraded during peak traffic times.\n\nEnabling IPS inline link state propagation (Option A) is a mechanism that ensures link state information is propagated to the inline security device, such as IPS. It helps ensure that the IPS does not forward traffic to an interface that is down. However, it does not directly address the issue of SNORT engine overload."

The Cisco FMC needs to include a file inspection policy for malware lookup:\nA file inspection policy can be used to inspect and analyze files that are transmitted over the network to determine if they contain malware. By configuring a file inspection policy in Cisco FMC, you can specify the types of files that should be inspected, the types of malware to look for, and the actions to take when malware is detected.\n\nB. The Cisco FMC needs to connect to the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service:\nBy connecting to the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service, Cisco FMC can leverage the advanced threat intelligence provided by AMP to analyze and identify potential malware threats in network traffic."

The bridge group is represented by a Bridge Virtual Interface (BVI) that has an IP address on the bridge network.\n\nYou can route between routed interfaces and BVIs, if you name the BVI. In this case, the BVI acts as the gateway between member interfaces and routed interfaces. If you do not name the BVI, traffic on the bridge group member interfaces cannot leave the bridge group. Normally, you would name the interface so that you can route member interfaces to the internet.\n\nOne use for a bridge group in routed mode is to use extra interfaces on the FTD device instead of an external switch. You can attach endpoints directly to bridge group member interfaces. You can also attach switches to add more endpoints to the same network as the BVI."

The static route tracking feature provides a method for tracking the availability of a static route and installing a backup route if the primary route should fail. For example, you can define a default route to an ISP gateway and a backup default route to a secondary ISP in case the primary ISP becomes unavailable.\n\nThe Firepower Threat Defense device implements static route tracking by associating a static route with a monitoring target host on the destination network that the Firepower Threat Defense device monitors using ICMP echo requests. If an echo reply is not received within a specified time period, the host is considered down, and the associated route is removed from the routing table. An untracked backup route with a higher metric is used in place of the removed route.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/601/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v601/fpmc-config-guide-v60_chapter_01100100.html#ID-2105-00000029"

Use the packet capture tool to check where the traffic is being blocked and adjust the access control or intrusion policy as needed.\n\nUsing the packet capture tool on the Cisco FTD device is an effective method for troubleshooting connectivity issues. By capturing packets and analyzing them, the engineer can identify where the traffic is being blocked and adjust the access control or intrusion policy as needed. In this case, capturing the real DNS packets can help determine if the packets are being blocked by the FTD device or if there is an issue with the DNS server itself. Once the issue is identified, the engineer can make necessary adjustments to the device policies to allow the traffic to flow properly."

With VPNs, you have split-tunnels and full tunnels, so you have to have one or the other with a remote access VPN and neither would fix the problem without a hairpin NAT statement.  Split-tunnels is essentially where the network specifies which subnets and hosts are to go across the VPN and which terminate locally out of your modem like normal internet traffic, hence the splitting of the tunnel.  \nAnother term for a hairpin is U-Turn, because it essentially leaves your home, goes into the outside interface of the firewall, makes a U-Turn and goes right back out the outside interface of the firewall to the Anyconnect users computer, wherever they may be in the world.  It is not D because that is for a site-to-site VPN, not a remote access VPN."

This means that when a remote user is on a call with another remote user using their softphone, the audio traffic may be sent directly between the two remote users and not through the corporate network. If split tunneling is enabled, the audio traffic would not be routed through the corporate network and would fail to reach the remote users.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the network administrator should disable split tunneling on the Remote Access VPN configuration in the FTD device. This will force all traffic to be routed through the corporate network, allowing the audio traffic to reach the remote users."

The main purpose of using pxGrid is to share contextual data between the integrated partners.\n\npxGrid uses a built-in API in ISE and it is comprised of three main components which are the controller, publisher and the subscriber. The controller is the core component to make everything working and as said is going to be ISE. The publisher instead is the partner that has some contextual data to be shared with the other partners. And finally the subscriber is the partner that is interested in parsing some contextual data from the other partners.\n\nReference: https://bluenetsec.com/fmc-pxgrid-integration-with-ise/\n\nTherefore the controller is ISE, there is no \u201csubscriber\u201d option so the best answer should be \u201cpublisher\u201d."

Transparent mode, by definition, means that the FTD is transparent to the network and does not modify the source and destination IP addresses of the packets that it receives. Therefore, to enable transparent mode, the FTD must have at least two interfaces connected to the same network segment. These interfaces are then placed in a bridge group, which allows the FTD to forward traffic between them without modifying the packets. Without a bridge group interface, the FTD cannot operate in transparent mode, and any attempt to do so will result in the device not passing traffic."

A bridge group is a logical entity that enables traffic forwarding between interfaces. By creating a separate bridge group for each network segment, traffic between the segments can be routed through the FTD appliance.\n\nOnce the bridge groups are created, the FTD appliance can be configured to allow traffic between the segments using access control policies. The policies can specify which traffic is allowed to pass between the segments and which traffic is blocked.\n\nIn summary, to configure access between two network segments within the same IP subnet using a Cisco FTD appliance, separate bridge groups must be created for each segment."

Although the bridging functions are separate for each bridge group, many other functions are shared between all bridge groups. For example, all bridge groups share a syslog server or AAA server configuration.\n\nYou can include multiple interfaces per bridge group.

Using SMB for backups can provide this secure storage.\n\nReports: Auditors need to access reports with their Active Directory logins. This requirement is well-suited for using NFS, as it allows for easy access control and integrates with Active Directory for authentication.\n\nWhile using SMB for both purposes is possible, it may not provide the same level of granularity and access control for reports as NFS integrated with Active Directory.\n\nSo option C is a more flexible choice that aligns with the specific requirements of the scenario."

You can control the flow of ARP packets by enabling ARP inspection.\n\nARP inspection prevents malicious users from impersonating other hosts or routers (known as ARP spoofing). ARP spoofing can enable a \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attack. For example, a host sends an ARP request to the gateway router; the gateway router responds with the gateway router MAC address. The attacker, however, sends another ARP response to the host with the attacker MAC address instead of the router MAC address. The attacker can now intercept all the host traffic before forwarding it on to the router.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/610/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v61/platform_settings_for_firepower_threat_defense.html#:~:text=all%20ARP%20packets%20are%20allowed%20between%20bridge%20group%20members."
