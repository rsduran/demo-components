    "answerDescription": "Extended Unique Identifier (EUI), as per RFC2373, allows a host to assign iteslf a unique 64-Bit IP Version 6 interface identifier (EUI-64). This feature is a key benefit over IPv4 as it eliminates the need of manual configuration or DHCP as in the world of IPv4. The IPv6 EUI-64 format address is obtained through the 48-bit<br>MAC address. The Mac address is first separated into two 24-bits, with one being OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and the other being NIC specific. The<br>16-bit 0xFFFE is then inserted between these two 24-bits to for the 64-bit EUI address. IEEE has chosen FFFE as a reserved value which can only appear in EUI-<br>64 generated from the EUI-48 MAC address.<br>Here is an example showing how the Mac Address is used to generate EUI.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02670/0002200001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Next, the seventh bit from the left, or the universal/local (U/L) bit, needs to be inverted. This bit identifies whether this interface identifier is universally or locally administered. If 0, the address is locally administered and if 1, the address is globally unique. It is worth noticing that in the OUI portion, the globally unique addresses assigned by the IEEE has always been set to 0 whereas the locally created addresses has 1 configured. Therefore, when the bit is inverted, it maintains its original scope (global unique address is still global unique and vice versa). The reason for inverting can be found in RFC4291 section 2.5.1.<br>Reference:<br>https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/100566/understanding-ipv6-eui-64-bit-address",

This is accomplished as a result of each EVN having a unique routing and forwarding table, thereby enabling support for overlapping IP addresses across multiple EVNs.<br>Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/evn/configuration/xe-3sg/evn-overview.pdf",

You select a load-balancing algorithm with the ip cef load- algorithm command. sharing<br>\u2711 Original algorithm--The original Cisco Express Forwarding load-balancing algorithm produces distortions in load sharing across multiple routers because the same algorithm was used on every router. Depending on your network environment, you should select either the universal algorithm (default) or the tunnel algorithm instead.<br>\u2711 Universal algorithm--The universal load-balancing algorithm allows each router on the network to make a different load sharing decision for each source- destination address pair, which resolves load-sharing imbalances. The router is set to perform universal load sharing by default.<br>\u2711 Tunnel algorithm--The tunnel algorithm is designed to balance the per-packet load when only a few source and destination pairs are involved.<br>\u2711 Include-ports algorithm--The include-ports algorithm allows you to use the Layer 4 source and destination ports as part of the load-balancing decision. This method benefits traffic streams running over equal cost paths that are not load shared because the majority of the traffic is between peer addresses that use different port numbers, such as Real-Time Protocol (RTP) streams. The include-ports algorithm is available in Cisco IOS Release 12.4(11)T and later releases.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipswitch_cef/configuration/15-mt/isw-cef-15-mt-book/isw-cef-load-balancing.html",

This can be seen in normal situations when there are multiple paths to/from a destination.

I agree now that correct answer is C.\n\nTCP MSS as described earlier takes care of fragmentation at the two endpoints of a TCP connection, but it does not handle the case where there is a smaller MTU link in the middle between these two endpoints. PMTUD was developed in order to avoid fragmentation in the path between the endpoints. It is used to dynamically determine the lowest MTU along the path from a packet's source to its destination.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/25885-pmtud-ipfrag.html#anc6"

The hosts will then compare the MSS size received against their own interface MTU and again choose the lower of the two values.\nScenario 2 illustrates this additional step taken by the sender in order to avoid fragmentation on the local and remote wires. Notice how the MTU of the outgoing interface is taken into account by each host (before the hosts send each other their MSS values) and how this helps to avoid fragmentation.\nIn Scenario 2, fragmentation does not occur at the endpoints of a TCP connection because both outgoing interface MTUs are taken into account by the hosts. Packets can still become fragmented in the network between Router A and Router B if they encounter a link with a lower MTU than that of either hosts' outbound interface.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/25885-pmtud-ipfrag.html#anc3"

    "answer": "Explanation",
    "answerDescription": "Stateful autoconfiguration is the IPv6 equivalent of DHCP. A new protocol, called DHCPv6 (and based closely on DHCP), is used to pass out addressing and service information in the same way that DHCP is used in IPv4. This is called \"stateful\" because the DHCP server and the client must both maintain state information to keep addresses from conflicting, to handle leases, and to renew addresses over time.<br>Stateless Autoconfiguration allows an interface to automatically \"lease\" an IPv6 address and does not require the establishment of an server to delve out address space. Stateless autoconfiguration allows a host to propose an address which will probably be unique (based on the network prefix and its Ethernet MAC address) and propose its use on the network. Because no server has to approve the use of the address, or pass it out, stateless autoconfiguration is simpler. This is the default mode of operation for most IPv6 systems, including servers",

If several match commands are present in a clause, all must succeed for a given route in order for that route to match the clause (in other words, the logical AND algorithm is applied for multiple match commands). In this question, both the \"match tag 6\" and \"match route-type external type-2\" must be matched for this route to be denied -&gt; A is correct.<br>If a match command is not present, all routes match the clause. In this question, all routes that reach clause 30 match and their tags are set to 8 -&gt; E is correct.<br>If a route is not matched with clause 10 or 20 then it will be matched with clause 30 for sure -&gt; F is correct.<br>Option C is incorrect because it says the route will be redistributed if it matches the prefix-list pfx AND the metric values. This is not true.<br>The route-map statement 20 SETS the seed metric for the prefixes identified by the prefix-list pfx. So the statement in option C is missing the \"SET\" keyword.<br>Option F is correct because the only deny statement in route-map is statement 10 which only denies Type-2 External routes that have a tag value of 6. This means all Type-1 External routes will be redistributed because they will match either permit statement 20 or 30.<br>Note: Route-maps that are applied to redistribution behave the same way as ACLs: if the route does not match any clause in a route-map then the route redistribution is denied, as if the route-map contained deny statement at the end.<br>Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a008047915d.shtml",

Dynamic ACLs starts with the application of an extended ACL to block traffic through the router.<br>Common reasons to use Dynamic ACLs are:<br>When you want a specific remote user or group of remote users to access a host within your network.<br>Connecting to the outside of your network (Internet) Lock-and-key authenticates the user and then permits limited access through your firewall router.<br>You want a subset of hosts on a local network to access a host from a remote network that is protected by a firewall.<br>Lock-and-key requires users to authenticate through an AAA, TACACS server or other security server before it allows access.<br><br>Reflexive ACLs -<br>Reflexive ACLs allow IP packets to be filtered based on upper-layer session information. Generally are used to allow outbound traffic and to limit inbound traffic by using sessions that originate inside the router. When a router sees a new outbound connection it adds an entry to a temporary ACL to allow replies back into the network. Reflexive ACLs can be defined only with an extended named IP ACL. They cannot be defined with numbered or standard named ACLs or with other protocols.<br><br>Time-Based ACLs -<br>Time-Based ACLs are like extended ACLs in function, but they allow access control based on time. To use time-based ACLs you create a time range that defines specific times of the day and days of the week. You use the time range with a name and then refer to it by a function. The time range relies on the router system clock. This feature works with NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization, but the router clock can also be used.<br><br>Numbered ACL -<br>You can assign a number based on whether your ACL is standard or extended<br>1 to 99 and 1300 to 1999 are Standard IP ACL<br>100 to 199 and 2000 to 2699 are Extended IP ACL<br>You cannot add or delete entries within the ACL (You have to totally delete the ACL in order to edit it)<br><br>Named ACL -<br>You can assign names to the ACL instead of numbers.<br>Names can contain alphanumeric characters<br>Recommended to type the name in all CAPITAL LETTERS<br>Names cannot contain spaces or punctuation and must begin with an alphabetic character<br>You can add or delete entries within the ACL<br>You can specify whether the ACL is standard or extended",

They contain temporary entries that are automatically created when a new IP session begins. They are nested within extended, named IP access lists that are applied to an interface. Reflexive access lists are typically configured on border routers, which pass traffic between an internal and external network. These are often firewall routers. Reflexive access lists do not end with an implicit deny statement because they are nested within an access list and the subsequent statements need to be examined.\n\ncisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_data_acl/configuration/15-1s/sec-access-list-ov.html"

So ip forward-protocol is not correct either.\nip dhcp relay is to configure additional option for the relay.\nI have configured ip helper address many times and it works out of the box by just configuring the ip helper-address command under a interface. The only way it won't work is if the service DHCP is turnned off for some reason which will disable both the DHCP server and relay agent functions on the router so in my opinion this answer makes most sense considering the question is worded"

Real- time traffic is delay sensitive. For Voice data, packet loss is manageable to some extent, but frequent losses impair communication between endpoints.<br>The UDP jitter operation is the most popular operation because the user can obtain packet loss, jitter and latency from one operation. This also includes unidirectional measurements as well. The Jitter operation is designed to measure the delay, delay variance and packet loss in IP networks by generating active<br>UDP traffic. It sends N packets, each of size S, from source router to a target router (which requires Cisco IOS IP SLAs responder enabled) each T milliseconds apart. All these parameters are user configurable.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipsla/configuration/15-mt/sla-15-mt-book/sla_udp_jitter.pdf",

R4 has been added to the existing OSPF network to provide the interconnect between the OSPF and EIGRP networks. Two links have been added that will provide redundancy.<br>The network requirements state that you must be able to ping and telnet from loopback 101 on R1 to the OPSF domain test address of 172.16.1.100.

    "answerDescription": "Information conventionally stored in a route cache is stored in several data structures for Cisco Express Forwarding switching.<br>The data structures provide optimized lookup for efficient packet forwarding. The two main components of Cisco Express Forwarding operation are the forwarding information base (FIB) and the adjacency tables.<br>The FIB is conceptually similar to a routing table or information base. A router uses this lookup table to make destination-based switching decisions during Cisco<br>Express Forwarding operation. The FIB is updated when changes occur in the network and contains all routes known at the time. For more information, see the<br>FIB Overview section.<br><br>Adjacency tables maintain Layer 2 next-hop addresses for all FIB entries. For more information, see the CEF Adjacency Tables Overview section.<br>This separation of the reachability information (in the Cisco Express Forwarding table) and the forwarding information (in the adjacency table), provides a number of benefits:<br>The adjacency table can be built separately from the Cisco Express Forwarding table, allowing both to be built without any packets being process-switched.<br>The MAC header rewrite used to forward a packet is not stored in cache entries, so changes in a MAC header rewrite string do not require validation of cache entries.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipswitch_cef/configuration/15-mt/isw-cef-15-mt-book/isw-cef-overview.html",

    "answerDescription": "The IP protocol was designed for use on a wide variety of transmission links. Although the maximum length of an IP datagram is 65535, most transmission links enforce a smaller maximum packet length limit, called an MTU. The value of the MTU depends on the type of the transmission link. The design of IP accommodates MTU differences since it allows routers to fragment IP datagrams as necessary. The receiving station is responsible for the reassembly of the fragments back into the original full size IP datagram.<br>Fragmentation and Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (PMTUD) is a standardized technique to determine the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size on the network path between two hosts, usually with the goal of avoiding IP fragmentation. PMTUD was originally intended for routers in IPv4. However, all modern operating systems use it on endpoints.<br>The TCP Maximum Segment Size (TCP MSS) defines the maximum amount of data that a host is willing to accept in a single TCP/IP datagram. This TCP/IP datagram might be fragmented at the IP layer. The MSS value is sent as a TCP header option only in TCP SYN segments. Each side of a TCP connection reports its MSS value to the other side. Contrary to popular belief, the MSS value is not negotiated between hosts. The sending host is required to limit the size of data in a single TCP segment to a value less than or equal to the MSS reported by the receiving host.<br>TCP MSS takes care of fragmentation at the two endpoints of a TCP connection, but it does not handle the case where there is a smaller MTU link in the middle between these two endpoints. PMTUD was developed in order to avoid fragmentation in the path between the endpoints. It is used to dynamically determine the lowest MTU along the path from a packet's source to its destination. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/25885-pmtud-ipfrag.html<br><br>(there is some examples of how TCP MSS avoids IP Fragmentation in this link but it is too long so if you want to read please visit this link)<br>Note: IP fragmentation involves breaking a datagram into a number of pieces that can be reassembled later.",

Each route that is redistributed into OSPF from other protocols is advertised individually with an external LSA. To reduce the size of the OSPF LSDB, you can configure a summary for external routes. Summarization of external routes can be done on the ASBR for type 5 LSAs (redistributed routes) before injecting them into the OSPF domain. Without summarization, all the redistributed external prefixes from external autonomous systems are passed into the OSPF area. A summary route to Null0 is created automatically for each summary range.\n\nThe ASBR will summarize external routes before injecting them into the OSPF domain as type 5 external LSAs. Table 3-4 shows the parameters used with the summary-address command.
