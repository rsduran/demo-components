Always consider reverting to the previously used software image before performing a factory reset. In many situations this will recover the system*.<br>A factory reset should only be performed by a system administrator or in contact with Cisco technical support. When factory resetting the video system the following happens:<br> The call logs will be deleted.<br> Passwords will be reset to default.<br> All system parameters will be reset to default values.<br> All files that have been uploaded to the system will be deleted. This includes, but is not limited to, custom backgrounds, certificates, and the favorites list (My contacts).<br> The previous (inactive) software image will be deleted.<br> Release keys and option keys will not be affected. The system restarts automatically after the reset. It is using the same software image as before. We strongly recommend that you backup your systems log files and configuration before you perform a factory reset.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01537/0005200001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\">",

This increases the maximum number of endpoints supported in a conference and can reduce bandwidth across links, depending on how the multipoint devices are deployed. Note that cascading conferences can create an inconsistent user experience, especially when features such as continuous presence are used by the endpoints. This is due to the remote conference appearing as just another endpoint on the local conference.\n\nWhen making use of cascading for a large briefing conference type, it is a best practice to have all slave MCUs set to full-screen voice switched, and the master MCU set to the desired Continuous Presence layout. All the main speakers should be located in the master MCU so that they can be provided with the best experience.\n\nread carefully; about the \"inconsistent\" experience with Contineous presence. This states against Continuous presence. It more or less recommends Voice switches (aka Active speaker) which does make more sense."
