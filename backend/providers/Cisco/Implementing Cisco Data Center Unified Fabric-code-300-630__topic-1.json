Why would you ever enable unicast routing if ACI is not the L3 Gateway?  Without Unicast routing enabled, ACI will not learn the IP address for Endpoints. This leads some customers to enable Unicast routing, because (understandably) they want to learn the IP endpoint and not just the mac-address of connected devices. The problem with this, is it can lead to asymmetric routing, which can result in packets being dropped or mis-routed."

Similarly, you won\u2019t experience issues with the BUM traffic that needs \n\n\nto be sent to remote pods, since only the spine nodes that are connected to the IPN \ndevices will be responsible for handling such traffic."

If that default value is not modified, the ISN must support an MTU size of at least 9000 bytes\n\nSo assuming the Spines control-plane settings are left at default the answer is A : 9000\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739609.html#IntersiteNetworkISNdeploymentconsiderations"

This approach allows existing network architecture and flows to remain the same, henceforth allowing IT resources considerable amount of time  to get acclimatized with the new terminologies of ACI fabric.\nOn the other hand, Application Centric approach is comparatively a new approach model where application tiers are defined by EPGs . In this setup, Application Profiles are created for each application with EPGs based on the application architecture tiers.
