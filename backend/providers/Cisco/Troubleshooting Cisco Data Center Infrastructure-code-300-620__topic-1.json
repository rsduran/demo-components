As soon as leaf receives the traffic and determines the end point information, it assigns the traffic to Proper EPG by matching the VLAN ID on port.\nExtending the Bridge Domain out of the ACI Fabric: It is also possible to extend the bridge domain by creating the layer 2 outside connection (External Bridge network). By doing so, it extend the bridge domain to the outside network."

Each FTag tree does not necessarily use all fabric uplinks. That is why ACI creates multiple FTag trees and load balances multi-destination traffic across them. All switches in a fabric understand based on the FTag bits in the GIPo address how to forward the traffic they receive further along the specified FTag tree. Four bits are used to identify FTag IDs; ACI fabrics support up to 12 FTag trees."

It effectively extends the bridge domain to the outside network.\n\n\n\nThe following sections explain these three options in greater detail.\n\nExtend the EPG Out of the ACI Fabric\n\nThe user can extend an EPG beyond an ACI leaf by statically assigning a leaf port (along with a VLAN ID) to an EPG. After doing so, all the traffic received on this leaf port with the configured VLAN ID will be mapped to the EPG and the configured policy for this EPG will be enforced. The endpoints need not be directly connected to the ACI leaf port. They can be behind a layer 2 network as long as the VLAN associated with the EPG is enabled within the layer 2 network that connects the remote endpoint to the ACI fabric.\n\nTo statically assign port to an EPG, go to menu Tenant\u00e0Application Profiles\u00e0EPG\u00e0Static Binding (Paths)."

Interleak redistribution in the Cisco ACI fabric refers to this redistribution of L3Out routes to the BGP IPv4/IPv6 address family.

A single data center might include multiple ACI fabrics; each data center might have its own APIC cluster and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches that are part of the fabric. To ensure that a switch is managed only by a single APIC cluster, each switch must be registered with that specific APIC cluster that manages the fabric.\n\nThe APIC discovers new switches that are directly connected to any switch it currently manages. Each APIC instance in the cluster first discovers only the leaf switch to which it is directly connected. After the leaf switch is registered with the APIC, the APIC discovers all spine switches that are directly connected to the leaf switch. As each spine switch is registered, that APIC discovers all the leaf switches that are connected to that spine switch. This cascaded discovery allows the APIC to discover the entire fabric topology in a few simple steps."

In order to get the DVS to use CDP, configure a vSwitch policy on the VMM Domain that has CDP enabled and LLDP disabled.\n\nAlong with this, the only supported load balancing mechanism when UCS B series is used is Route Based on Originating Virtual Port.

Suppose that hardware proxy has been enabled on a bridge domain, ARP flooding has been disabled, and ACI has already learned a silent host in the BD through ARP gleaning. If the silent host moves from one location to another without notifying the new ACI leaf via GARP or some other mechanism, ACI switches continue to forward traffic intended for the silent IP address to the previous location until retention timers clear the endpoint from COOP. Until that point, if an endpoint sends ARP requests toward this silent host, ARP gleaning is not triggered because COOP considers the destination endpoint to be known. On the other hand, with ARP flooding enabled on the BD, ARP requests are flooded, and the silent host responds at its new location, enabling the new local leaf to learn the silent host and update COOP."

This behaviour is controlled by the hardware proxy option associated with a bridge domain: if the destination is not known, send the packet to the spine proxy; if the spine proxy also does not know the address, discard the packet (default mode).\n\nThe advantage of the hardware proxy mode is that no flooding occurs in the fabric. The potential disadvantage is that the fabric has to learn all the endpoint addresses.\n\nWith Cisco ACI, however, this is not a concern for virtual and physical servers that are part of the fabric: the database is built for scalability to millions of endpoints. However, if the fabric had to learn all the IP addresses coming from the Internet, it would clearly not scale."

By default, ARP traffic is not flooded but sent to the destination endpoint. By enabling ARP flooding, ARP traffic is also flooded. A good use case for enabling ARP flooding would be when the Default Gateway resides outside of the ACI Fabric. This non-optimal configuration will require ARP Flooding enabled on the BD.\n\nThis mode of operation is equivalent to that of a regular Layer 2 switch, except that in Cisco ACI this traffic is transported in the fabric as a Layer 3 frame with all the benefits of Layer 2 multi-pathing, fast convergence, and so on.\n\nHardware proxy and unknown unicast and ARP flooding are two opposite modes of operation. With hardware proxy disabled and without unicast and ARP flooding, Layer 2 switching would not work.\n\nThis option does not have any impact on what the mapping database actually learns; the mapping database is always populated for Layer 2 entries regardless of this configuration."

        "content": "The APIC startup topology auto discovery, automated configuration, and infrastructure addressing uses these industry-standard protocols: Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS), Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). \n\nThe ACI fabric is brought up in a cascading manner, starting with the leaf nodes that are directly attached to the APIC. LLDP and control-plane IS-IS convergence occurs in parallel to this boot process. The ACI fabric uses LLDP- and DHCP-based fabric discovery to automatically discover the fabric switch nodes, assign the infrastructure VXLAN tunnel endpoint (VTEP) addresses, and install the firmware on the switches. Prior to this automated process, a minimal bootstrap configuration must be performed on the Cisco APIC controller. After the APIC controllers are connected and their IP addresses assigned, the APIC GUI can be accessed by entering the address of any APIC controller into a web browser. The APIC GUI runs HTML5 and eliminates the need for Java to be installed locally."

Multiple pods provide intensive fault isolation in the control plane along with infrastructure cabling flexibility. As the name indicates, it connects multiple Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) pods using a Layer 3 interpod network (IPN).\n\nNote:     Pod spine switches cannot be connected back to back. IPN supports only Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) connectivity between the IPN and the spine switches. Though each pod consists of its own spine and leaf switches, all the pods reside within the same fabric and are managed by a single APIC cluster. This approach provides a single management and policy domain across all pods for end-to-end policy enforcement. In the data plane, the Multi-Pod solution uses Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) connectivity over the IPN between the spine switches from each pod for communication using Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) encapsulation."

If you do not mark the subnet with this control, then routes learned from one EPG are advertised to the other external EPG, but packets are dropped in the fabric. The drops occur because the APIC operates in a allowed list model where the default behavior is to drop all data plane traffic between EPGs, unless it is explicitly permitted by a contract.

The IPN is not managed by the APIC, instead the user would configure it separately. Connectivity within each pod to the IPN takes place on the spine nodes, but there is no requirement to connect every spine to the IPN. All inter-pod traffic is encapsulated with VXLAN. Multi-destination traffic is dispersed to the pods via multicast, so there is a requirement for the IPN to support PIM bidirectional mode multicast.\n\nThe control-plane between the pods leverages MP-BGP EVPN. This is how endpoint information is advertised between the pods so that communication from an endpoint in one pod to an endpoint in another pod will be seamless."

Thus, use of Rogue EP Control instead of Ep Loop Protection is recommended after APIC Release 3.2. Please be aware that the detection mechanism of Ep Loop Protection is strictly for a loop, because it triggers the move only when the move is between the same two interfaces.

Cisco ACI data-plane endpoint learning detects these events quickly and updates the Cisco ACI endpoint database on a new leaf. In addition to data-plane learning, Cisco ACI uses bounce entries to manage the old endpoint information on the original leaf.\n\nWhen a new local endpoint is detected on a leaf, the leaf updates the COOP database on spine switches with its new local endpoint. If the COOP database has already learned the same endpoint from another leaf, COOP will recognize this event as an endpoint move and report this move to the original leaf that contained the old endpoint information. The old leaf that receives this notification will delete its old endpoint entry and create a bounce entry, which will point to the new leaf. A bounce entry is basically a remote endpoint created by COOP communication instead of data-plane learning."

Multi-Protocol BGP has been chosen for this function. This is due to the flexibility and scalability properties of this protocol and its support of different address families (like EVPN and VPNv4) allowing the exchange of Layer 2 and Layer 3 information in a true multi-tenant fashion."

This can be done on the granularity of a snapshot file. This means that a single tenant can be moved back to a previous configuration while the other tenants keep their current configuration state. This is often referred to as partial rollback.

Enabling this feature is a best practice and it should be enabled globally and on all interfaces, regardless of the end device.  MCP works to stop Layer-2 loops, it should be enabled right away on an ACI Fabric prior to connecting Layer-2 devices for migration purposes.\n\nAs explained in this article, ACI Operation with L2 Switches and Spanning-tree Link Types, by default, the STP link type on Legacy switches is P2P.  ACI acts as a hub for BPDUs. By configuring the STP link type as Shared for your external switch interfaces which connect to ACI, you ensure that you allow the switches to take their time with the STP transition process, thereby protecting your environment from potential STP loop formation. Even though ACI does not generate STP BPDUs, ACI switches will forward STP BPDUs across EPGs on which they are received. This allows the externally connected switches to maintain a loop-free topology and avoid broadcast storms and other nastiness that goes hand-in-hand when layer-2 loops form!"

Cisco ACI data-plane endpoint learning detects these events quickly and updates the Cisco ACI endpoint database on a new leaf. In addition to data-plane learning, Cisco ACI uses bounce entries to manage the old endpoint information on the original leaf.\n\nThe difference between a bounce entry and a remote endpoint is in whether or not the leaf rewrites the outer source IP address of the packet. When a packet uses a normal remote endpoint, the Cisco ACI leaf uses its own TEP address as the outer source IP address, so the remote leaf learns this packet with its own TEP. When a packet uses a bounce entry, the Cisco ACI leaf doesn\u2019t rewrite the outer source IP address, so the remote data-plane learning will behave as if the packet came from the originating leaf rather than the intermediate \u201cbounce\u201d leaf."

This EPG connects to the external switches that run MST.\n\nAdministrator must configure the mapping of MST instances to VLANs to define which MAC address table must be flushed when a Topology Change Notification (TCN) occurs. When a TCN event occurs on the external Layer 2 network, this TCN reaches the leafs to which it connects via the MST EPG, and flushes the local endpoint information associated with these VLANs on these leafs; as result, these entries are removed from the spine-proxy mapping database."

This IP reachability will be leveraged so that each node can individually query the same NTP server as a consistent clock source. To configure NTP, a Date and Time policy must be created that references an out-of-band management endpoint group.

By default, a tenant administrator does not have rights to the infra domain. In this case, a tenant administrator who plans to use a bare metal server connected to a leaf switch could not complete all the necessary steps to do so. The tenant administrator would have to coordinate with a fabric administrator who has rights to the infra domain.

        "content": "The difference of enabling and disabling the ARP flooding option appears once ACI learns a silent host IP. One of the benefits of enabling ARP flooding is to be able to detect a silent IP that moved from one location to another without notifying an ACI leaf. Because the ARP request is flooded within the BD, even if the ACI leaf still thinks the IP is at the old location, the host with the silent IP would respond appropriately so that the ACI leaf can update its entry accordingly. If ARP flooding is disabled, the ACI leaf would keep forwarding the ARP request only to the old location until the IP endpoint ages out. On the other hand, the benefit of disabling ARP flooding is to be able to optimize traffic flow by sending the ARP request directly to the location of the target IP, assuming no endpoint moves without notifying its movement via GARP and such.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739989.html#Silenthostsconsiderations"

This behavior is originally triggered by the spine when the spine couldn\u2019t find the unknown IP, even in the COOP database. This behavior is called silent host detection, or ARP gleaning.

        "content": "The difference of enabling and disabling the ARP flooding option appears once ACI learns a silent host IP. One of the benefits of enabling ARP flooding is to be able to detect a silent IP that moved from one location to another without notifying an ACI leaf. Because the ARP request is flooded within the BD, even if the ACI leaf still thinks the IP is at the old location, the host with the silent IP would respond appropriately so that the ACI leaf can update its entry accordingly. If ARP flooding is disabled, the ACI leaf would keep forwarding the ARP request only to the old location until the IP endpoint ages out. On the other hand, the benefit of disabling ARP flooding is to be able to optimize traffic flow by sending the ARP request directly to the location of the target IP, assuming no endpoint moves without notifying its movement via GARP and such.                                                                       https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739989.html"

While ARP requests can help in endpoint discovery, this option does not apply to how silent hosts are detected since the host does not send ARP messages.\nSould be D no ? Bounce entries are created when ACI detects that an endpoint has moved from one location to another within the fabric. If the endpoint (silent host) moves but doesn't announce itself via ARP or other traffic, a bounce entry is used to track the old location of the host. When traffic is sent to this silent host, the bounce entry on the original leaf forwards the traffic to the new location, allowing the fabric to update its endpoint database."
