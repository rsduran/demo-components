To achieve this, a DNS zone must be configured on the Expressway Edge. This allows the system to perform DNS lookups to resolve the domain names of external organizations using a public DNS address. The Expressway Edge will query public DNS servers to find the appropriate address or SRV records to route the call to the correct destination.\n\nTo clarify:\n\nA. Traversal zone to a public DNS address: Traversal zones are used for internal communication between the Expressway Core and Edge, not for resolving unknown external domains.\nTherefore, the correct configuration for routing calls to an unknown domain in a B2B environment is D.

The SIP registrar maintains a record of the endpoint\u2019s details against the endpoint\u2019s AOR. The AOR is the alias through which the endpoint can be contacted; it is a SIP Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) and always takes the form username@domain. \n\nIf the Server Discovery mode is set to manual, the user must specify the IP address or FQDN of the registrar (Expressway or Expressway cluster) with which they want to register, and the endpoint will attempt to register with that registrar only."
