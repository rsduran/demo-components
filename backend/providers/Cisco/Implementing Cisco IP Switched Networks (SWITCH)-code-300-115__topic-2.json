Authentication is to be done via a<br>Radius server:<br>- Radius server host: 172.120.40.46<br>- Radius key: rad123<br>- Authentication should be implemented as close to the host as possible.<br>\u2711 Devices on VLAN 20 are restricted to the subnet of 172.120.40.0/24.<br>- Packets from devices in the subnet of 172.120.40.0/24 should be allowed on VLAN 20.<br>- Packets from devices in any other address range should be dropped on VLAN 20.<br>- Filtering should be implemented as close to the server farm as possible.<br>The Radius server and application servers will be installed at a future date. You have been tasked with implementing the above access control as a pre-condition to installing the servers. You must use the available IOS switch features.<br>Note: Named access list is not supported.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01585/0014600001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01585/0014700001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01585/0014800001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>",
