    "answerDescription": "At a basic level,roamingin an enterprise IEEE 802.11 network occurs when an IEEE 802.11 client changes its access point (AP) association from one AP to another AP within the same WLAN. Depending on client capabilities, an 802.11 WLAN client may roam on the same WLAN between APs within the same frequency band or between the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. Smartphones and tablets that have simultaneous cellular and Wi-Fi connections may seamlessly roam across networks provided there is a suitable infrastructure network design. When a clientroams from a WLAN with one service set identifier<br>(SSID) to a WLAN with another SSID, the roam will not be seamless. The Wi-Fi client logic maintains only one Wi-Fi WLAN authentication at a time.<br>Reference:<br>http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/RToWLAN/CCVP_BK_R7805F20_00_rtowlan-srnd/<br>CCVP_BK_R7805F20_00_rtowlan-srnd_chapter_0101.html#CCVP_RF_R0D3C4EC_00",

The initial handshake with the new Access Point (AP) occurs before client roams to the target AP, called as Fast Transition (FT).\n\nInitial handshake allows the client and APs to do Pairwise Master Key (PMK) calculation in advance. Once the client performs the re-association request or response exchange with the new AP, the PMK keys are applied to the client and AP. The FT key hierarchy allows clients to make fast Base Station Subsystem (BSS) transitions between APs without the need for re-authentication at every AP. 802.11r eliminates the handshake overhead while roaming and thereby reduces the hand off times between APs, which provides security and QoS. It is useful for client devices with delay-sensitive applications, such as, voice and video over Wi-Fi.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-1/Enterprise-Mobility-8-1-Design-Guide/Enterprise_Mobility_8-1_Deployment_Guide/Chapter-11.html"
