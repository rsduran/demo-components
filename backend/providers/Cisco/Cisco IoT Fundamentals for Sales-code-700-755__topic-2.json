Because of this, I want to say the answer is D...but...\nThe Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controller on Catalyst 9K switches is not something that was covered in any of the videos, but slide 51 in this PDF points me to this as the answer. https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/apjc/docs/2020/pdf/BRKEWN-2670.pdf\nThe 9800-L is a device that does support SD-Access, but also supports other modes of deployment, so the inclusion of the word \"only\" in the question I feel rules this answer out.\nThe 9800-CL is a software appliance/VM and does support SD-Access, but not \"only\", thus ruling this answer out, as well.\nSo, I think the answer is A or D, but I can't confirm which one is *the* correct answer."
