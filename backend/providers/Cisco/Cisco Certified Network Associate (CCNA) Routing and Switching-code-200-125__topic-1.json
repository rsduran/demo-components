This command sets the number of seconds R3 waits before sending the next hello packet out this interface. In this case after configuring this command, R3 will send hello packets to R5 every 50 seconds. But the default value of hello-interval is<br>10 seconds and R5 is using it. Therefore we can think of a hello interval mismatch problem here. You can verify with the \"show ip ospf interface &lt;interface&gt;\" command on each router.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01508/0003000001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>So we can see both hello and dead interval are mismatched because the dead interval always four times the value of hello interval, unless you manually configure the dead interval (with the ip ospf dead-interval &lt;seconds&gt; command).",

RFC 1994 describes the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol ( CHAP ) which is the preferred way to perform PPP authentication, although the Password Authentication Protocol ( PAP ) is sometimes still used. Another option for authentication is the Extensible Authentication Protocol ( EAP ).\nCompression . Effectively increases the throughput of a PPP connection by compressing data in a frame. The best known PPP frame compression algorithms are Stacker and Predictor.\nError detection . Includes Quality-Protocol and helps identify feedback loops through Magic Numbers RFC 1661 .\nMultichannel . Multilink PPP (MLPPP, MPPP, MLP) provides methods for propagating traffic over multiple physical links with a single logical connection. This option allows you to expand bandwidth and provides load balancing."

So Answer C: Leased lines require little installation and maintenance expertise IS CORRECT !!!\n\n+ Quality: Point-to-point communication links usually offer high service quality, if they have adequate bandwidth.\nThe dedicated capacity removes latency or jitter between the endpoints. So Answer B: Leased lines with sufficient bandwidth can avoid latency between endpoints IS CORRECT!!!!!\n\nThe disadvantages of leased lines include:\n+ Limited flexibility: WAN traffic is often variable, and leased lines have a fixed capacity, so the bandwidth of the line seldom matches the need exactly, therefore answer D IS NOT CORRECT.\n\nAdditionally, any change to the leased line generally requires a site visit by ISP personnel to adjust capacity."

Conversely, a southbound interface allows a particular network component to communicate with a lower-level component.\nThe northbound APIs on an SDN controller enable applications and orchestration systems to program the network and request services from it.\n\nSouthbound interfaces are implemented with a Service Abstraction Layer (SAL) which speak to network devices using SNMP and CLI (Command Line Interface) of the elements that make up the network. The main functions of SAL are:\n+ Expose device services and capabilities to apps\n+ Determine how to fulfill requested service irrespective of the underlying protocol\n\nNote:\n+ An API is a method for one application (program) to exchange data with another application.\n+ Interface here refers to the \u201csoftware interface\u201d, not the physical interfaces."

This isn\u2019t possible on an infrastructure based on IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels, so ISATAP solves that in a different way. An ISATAP router is provided on the network and its IPv4 address is made known to the ISATAP hosts (usually using the hostname isatap. in DNS). The ISATAP hosts then can use that address to set up their IPv6 connectivity."

This new mechanism uses a mix of ICMPv6 messages and multicast addresses.\nStateless Auto-Configuration \u2013 This mechanism allows nodes on the local link to configure their IPv6 addresses by themselves by using a mix of ICMPv6 messages and multicast addresses.\nRouter Redirection \u2013 The router sends ICMPv6 messages to an IPv6 node to inform it of the presence of a better router address on the same local link to reach a destination network."
