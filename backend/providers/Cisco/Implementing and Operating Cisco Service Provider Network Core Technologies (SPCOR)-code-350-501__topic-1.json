Customer subnets (like a.b.c.d/30) were automatically redistributed into the IGP by the PE routers, so they are known by the other PEs and border routers. iBGP address-family ipv4 between border routers and PE routers was not used, so the IGP was involved for distributing the default route and customer subnets."

EGP is used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems (AS), while IGP is used to exchange routing information within an AS. By separating Internet access and MPLS L3 VPN services into different routing instances, it is possible to use different routing protocols for each service. This can help to optimize network performance and reduce the risk of routing conflicts and instability.\nAnother reason for implementing a full separation model is that it allows the network operator to choose whether to separate or centralize each individual service. This means that services can be deployed in a way that best suits the needs of the organization, rather than being constrained by the limitations of a single routing instance. For example, the Internet access service may be centralized for better security, while the MPLS L3 VPN service may be separated for better performance."

The FRR mechanism allows data to continue to flow while the headend router attempts to establish a new end-to-end LSP that bypasses the failure. FRR locally repairs any protected LSPs by rerouting them over backup tunnels that bypass failed links or nodes.\n\nThe headend is notified of the failure through the IGP and through RSVP. The headend then attempts to establish a new LSP that bypasses the failure (LSP rerouting).\n\nThe important fact to remember is that when using fast reroute, the protection kicks in as soon as the protected interface fails, which in turn forces the head end to recalculate a new path for the dynamic Cisco MPLS TE tunnel. In that brief period of time, between when the head-end of tunnel 1 realizes that the path is invalid and when the new path is calculated, the fast reroute happens via a predefined tunnel. Fast Reroute prevents end to end traffic loss during the path recalculation."

It would include TCP and UDP as the protocol has not been configured for specific protocol 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP)\n\nC is not correct for what we see configured.  \n\nI still think D is correct because indeed this policy is learned via BGP Flowsec and does have active traffic on it as shows by the Matched and Dropped counters.  \n\n\nhttps://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/emea/docs/2019/pdf/BRKSPG-3012.pdf"

This is the Service Provider exam, so in my opinion we need to approach this as being the service provider, and therefore, need to see this as changes that need to be made on our equipment. Service providers generally don't make changes of this kind for one customer but they do have BGP policy lists that are available to customers to use to put community tags on their prefixes that will cause policies on the service provider to be enacted. Through the use of community tags by the customer, and community lists by us (the service provider), the path can be manipulated by use of a route-map that adjusts the local preference of how to reach the customer's site. So I think B is the best answer."

So the configuration will be what they are doing in their network which throws MED out of the equation since that's something the ISP would do to influence their traffic outbound. Local Pref is the way you influence how you route outbound for the entire AS domain. However, the policy is applied to the routes you learn which means as the route comes INBOUND you use a matching clause and set the local pref. The correct answer is Local Pref inbound FOR THE CUSTOMER, which is who you are helping."

If a packet with an IPv4 MTU larger than the maximum arrives at the router interface, it will be either discarded, if the DF bit in the packet header is set, or it will be fragmented. OSPF for IPv4 packets completely relies on IPv4 for the possible fragmentation. Although RFC 2328 does not recommend OSPF packet fragmentation, in some situations the size of the OSPF packet has greater value than the interface IPv4 MTU. If MTUs are mismatched between two neighbors, this could introduce issues with exchange of link-state packets, resulting in continuous retransmissions.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe interface command for setting the IPv6 MTU parameter is ipv6 mtu. An IPv6 router does not fragment an IPv6 packet unless it is the source of the packet.\n\nTo prevent such issues, OSPF requires that the same IPv4 MTU be configured on both sides of the link. If neighbors have a mismatched IPv4 MTU configured, they will not be able to form full OSPF adjacency. They will be stuck in the ExStart adjacency state."

The administrator of ASN 64502 wants traffic from ASN 64501 to 10.0.0.0/8 to travel via the primary link, North_A\n\nWe have an eBGP peering from South_A to North_A. We can apply a route-map of LP with LP of 200 for example, assuming this value will be higher, the route-map gets applied to the neighbor statement in the inbound direction. The 10/8 prefix advertised by 64502 to 64501 would be advertised by North_A and received by South_A. South_A has the route-map applied, applying the LP of 200 to the 10/8 route. \n\nLocal Preference influences how traffic will leave the local AS. Traffic from 64501 towards 64502 is the egress path via South_A. A higher local preference would send the traffic the correct direction. \n\nWeight goes by the higher value. Lowest metric for MED. Technically both of these could be used, but other configurations would be needed to get traffic to South_A in the first place. Local Preference is advertised to all iBGP peers in the AS."

A horrible idea.  origin can be set with route maps, but thats not the intended purpose.  Origin should be left alone.\nAnswer C: incorrect.  Setting MED on the inbound routes at PE1 has no effect on incoming traffic.  you would have to set lower MED on the outbound prefixes to allow the Provider to prefer PE1... and that is ONLY IF both PE1 and PE2 connect to the same provider.  you would also have to set a higher med on PE2 so that PE1 is preferred.\n-None of the answers are a good solution because asymmetric routing can still occur. but the question asks for a preffered path \"TO the internet\", so that means outbound traffic.  \nI'll stick with answer A.

For these nondirectly connected neighbors, the LSR sends out a targeted Hello message as a UDP packet, but as a unicast message specifically addressed to that LSR. The nondirectly connected LSR responds to the Hello message and the two routers begin to establish an LDP session. This is called EXTENDED DISCOVERY.\nAn MPLS LDP targeted session is a label distribution session between routers that are not directly connected. When you create an MPLS traffic engineering tunnel interface, you need to establish a label distribution session between the tunnel headend and the tailend routers. You establish nondirectly connected MPLS LDP sessions by enabling the transmission of targeted Hello messages.\nYou can use the ****mpls ldp neighbor targeted****command to set up a targeted session when other means of establishing targeted sessions do not apply, such as configuring mpls ip on a traffic engineering (TE)...."

However, if R2 does not accept targeted-hellos than the session protection will not work. \n\nFrom Karen's Comment: \nif you were to set the timer on both routers, then you would enable session protection on both routers. This will bring up the session:\nR1(config)# mpls ldp session protection duration 30\nR2(config)# mpls ldp session protection duration 30\n\n\nAlthough Cisco says that you can enable session protection on 1 router, it also says that the neighbor would need to be configured to accept targeted hellos. In this question we have no way of knowing targeted-hellos are enabled on either router thus, we are left with C being the best option."

The traffic from sources to the RP initially flows encapsulated in register messages. This activity presents a significant burden because of the encapsulation and de-encapsulation mechanisms. Additionally, an SPT is built between the RP and the source, which results in (S,G) entries being created between the RP and the source.\nBIDIR-PIM (Bidirectional PIM) is designed to be used for many-to-many applications. Multicast groups in bidirectional mode can scale to an arbitrary number of sources without incurring overhead due to the number of sources. BIDIR-PIM eliminates the registration and encapsulation process and the (S,G) state. Packets are natively forwarded from a source to the RP using the (*,G) state only. This capability ensures that only (*,G) entries will appear in multicast forwarding tables"

The only exception is the redistribution of the RR (ABR) loopbacks from core IGP into aggregation IGPs because the loopback prefix of the RRs must be known in the aggregation IGP also, so that BGP on the PE router can peer with the loopback of the RR. Other prefixes are never redistributed between the core and aggregation layers. \n\nRoute Reflectors are configured with the next-hop-self all feature to allow for RRs to change next hop to their own loopback IP even for the reflected prefixes. LDP operates normally inside the IGP islands, however ***BGP labeled unicast layer*** is responsible for the inter network segment label exchange."

The objective is to join them together so that there is a single MPLS path (Internal BGP (iBGP) hierarchal LSP) between Pre-Aggregation (Pre-Agg) Nodes. As the network is a single BGP Autonomous System (AS), all sessions are iBGP sessions. Each segment runs its own IGP (OSPF, IS-IS,or EIGRP) and LDP LSP paths within the IGP domain. Within Cisco Unified MPLS, the routers (ABRs) that join the segments must be BGP inline route-reflectors with the Next-Hop-Self and RFC 3107 in order to carry a IPv4 + Label configured on the sessions.

NetFlow and Classification ACLs are the two primary methods to accomplish this with Cisco IOS software. NetFlow can provide visibility into all traffic on the network. Additionally, NetFlow can be implemented with collectors that can provide long-term trending and automated analysis.

In a Cisco networking device, packet forwarding is provided by Cisco Express Forwarding. Cisco Express Forwarding maintains the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), and uses the FIB information that is current at the time of a switchover to continue forwarding packets during a switchover, to reduce traffic interruption during the switchover.\"\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9400/software/release/16-6/configuration_guide/stck_mgr_ha/b_166_nsf_sso_9400_cg.html"

While OSPF can work with NSF to reduce convergence time during failover, simply implementing OSPF does not ensure packet forwarding during the switchover. The forwarding capability is managed by CEF in the context of NSF. NSF requires the routing protocol (like OSPF) to support NSF to avoid re-convergence, but OSPF alone is not sufficient to ensure packet forwarding during the failover.\nD. Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is a key component in maintaining packet forwarding during failovers when NSF is enabled. CEF allows the router to continue forwarding packets even if the control plane (routing protocols) is momentarily unavailable during a switchover. This makes CEF implementation crucial for NSF to function effectively, which is why this is the correct answer."

In this scenario, since the organization is merging two networks that are using different routing protocols, route redistribution is likely necessary. \nThe route map named match-tag is configured to match routes with the tag 15. This route map should be applied during the redistribution process to control which routes are redistributed based on the tag.\nTo complete the implementation, the route map must be attached to the redistribution command.

The centralized intelligence can focus on network resource optimization by pushing optimum end-to-end paths in the network by a centralized entity."

The two PE routes establish an MP-EBGP session to share their customers' respictive VPNv4  routes (but these sessions are not directly to each other but via ASBRs) \nC. is not correct - because only the ASBRs exchange routes via unlabeled IPv4. PEs must use VPNv4 for their VRF\nD. Not correct - this is interAS-C!

Once LDP has established, the IGP readvertises the link with its normal metric, allowing traffic to flow over the link.\n\nDisabling the holddown only limits the length of time the IGP will wait before establishing a session on the interface, so answer A is incorrect.\n\nSync delay is used to delay the \"synchronized\" message from LDP to the IGP. This is not necessary for LDP-IGP sync to function, so answer D is incorrect.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/ios/config/17-x/mpls/b-mpls/m_mp-ldp-igp-synch.html"

The BGP table looks like this:\n\nentry1: AS(PATH) 100, med 200, external, rid 1.1.1.1\nentry2: AS(PATH) 500, med 100, internal, rid 172.16.8.4 \nentry3: AS(PATH) 500, med 150, external, rid 172.16.13.1\nThere is a group for AS 100 and a group for AS 500. The best entries for each group are compared. Entry1 is the best of its group because it is the only route from AS 100. Entry2 is the best for AS 500 because it has the lowest MED. Next, entry1 is compared to entry2. Since the two entries are not from the same neighbor autonomous system, the MED is not considered in the comparison. The external BGP route wins over the internal BGP route, making entry1 the best route.\nClearly A, the example is  copy/paste from this"

It says \"Application server traffic should pass through the R1 Eth2/1 interface for further analysis after it is monitored\"  But the server traffic is not going to the flow collector! Thats a dead end.  Application server data is going out to the desistination determined by the application.   It is only the Netflow data which is going to the flow collector.    This is unfortunately another poorly written question.   But of course looking at the topology, the correct answer must be C."

DWDM allows multiple optical signals, each operating at a different wavelength, to be combined and transmitted over a single optical fiber.\n\nReconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) is indeed a technology used in conjunction with Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) to manage and optimize wavelengths in a fiber-optic network. A ROADM allows for the flexible addition and dropping of specific wavelengths at different points in the network without disturbing the rest of the traffic.\nSo, while DWDM is the primary technology for adding new wavelengths, a ROADM is a key component that provides flexibility in routing and managing those wavelengths"

On the LAN, we can have IPv4 and IPv6 hosts. When an IPv6 host transmits a packet, the CE router encapsulates the IPv6 packet in an IPv4 packet and depending on the destination, it is transferred to another CE router or the BR (Border Relay) router of the ISP.\n\nThe border relay router has an IPv4 address on the ISP network side and provides connectivity between the CE routers and the IPv6 Internet. When it receives an IPv6 packet that is encapsulated in an IPv4 packet from one of the CEs, it de-encapsulates the packet and forwards it to the IPv6 internet.\n\nhttps://networklessons.com/cisco/ccie-routing-switching-written/ipv6-6rd-rapid-deployment"

The IGP traffic path was switched to the alternate path via E and F, but label forwarding didn't occur on the new path. LDP sync only holds the IGP forwarding until LDP is up, but it doesn't ensure the end-to-end path traffic.\n\nIf there was LDP session protection on rotuers A and D, it would keep sending targeted hellos using the alternate path (A-E-F-D); hence, it would ensure traffic in case of one path failure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."

Upon link-up, for example, IGP can advertise and use a link before LDP convergence has occurred;\nLDP IGP synchronization synchronizes LDP and IGP so that IGP advertises links with regular metrics only when MPLS LDP is converged on that link. \n\nB: B is also a good answer. LDP Session Protection lets you configure LDP to automatically protect sessions with all or a given set of peers (as specified by the peer ACL). When configured, LDP initiates backup targeted hellos automatically for neighbors for which primary link adjacencies already exist. These backup targeted hellos maintain LDP sessions when primary link adjacencies go down. \nIn brief. LDP targeted hellos maintain the protection path for the non-directly connected neighbor. And it is the best solution for the protection path."
