It includes the ability to execute Python scripts as part of its workflow, which offers an unparalleled level of flexibility. Today, POAP can download and install additional management agents and apply specific configurations, based on information such as location in a network topology.\n\nA similar approach is achieved using PXE, which uses a process that is well known in compute environments. PXE has extended its presence into the network because infrastructure devices are increasingly managed more like servers. Cisco NX-OS uses Enhanced Preboot Execution Environment (iPXE), which is an open source network firmware that is based on gPXE/Etherboot. With PXE, you can use existing skill sets and infrastructures that were developed for compute environments to simplify initial device startup."
