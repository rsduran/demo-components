The access switch provides the same routing functionality as the branch router, and the distribution switch provides the same routing functions as the WAN aggregation router. In the branch WAN, the EIGRP stub feature is configured on all of the branch routers to prevent the aggregation router from sending queries to the edge access routers. In the campus, configuring EIGRP stub on the Layer 3 access switches also prevents the distribution switch from generating downstream queries. \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Campus/routed-ex.html\nA is a better answer"

A typical connection from a distribution device to a remote device would have much less bandwidth than a connection at the network core. Attempting to use a remote device with a limited bandwidth connection as a transit path would generally produce excessive congestion at the remote device. The EIGRP stub routing feature can prevent this problem by preventing the remote device from advertising core routes back to the distribution devices. In the above example, routes learned by the remote device from distribution Device 1 will not be advertised to distribution Device 2. Therefore, distribution Device 2 will not use the remote device as a transit for traffic destined to the network core."

Following figure 2-14 in the book and below output, routes learned from spoke where stub configured are not advertised through the links (transit links) to other spokes from hub perspective. \n\nWith the EIGRP stub routing feature, the routers (typically\nthe spokes) configured as a stub will send a special peer information packet to all\nneighboring devices to report its status as a stub router. In turn, any EIGRP neighbor\nthat receives a packet informing it of the stub status will not query the stub device for\nany routes (see Figure 2-14), and a router that has a stub peer will not query that peer.\nTherefore, the stub device will depend on the hub router(s) to send proper updates to all\nother spokes. Also, when an EIGRP stub is configured at the spokes routers, they will not\nbe used as transit routers by the other spokes or hub routers."

In addition, when building topology with point-to-point links, consider using /31 subnets for the links to conserve address space when possible. Address the links out of the address space that is available on the spoke to allow for simple summarization.
