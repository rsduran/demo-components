If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration."

Specifically, network operators should prefer summarization, stub area usage, queue tuning, and buffer tuning before changing the default timers.Furthermore, there are no guidelinesfor changing timer values; each OSPFdeployment is unique and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
