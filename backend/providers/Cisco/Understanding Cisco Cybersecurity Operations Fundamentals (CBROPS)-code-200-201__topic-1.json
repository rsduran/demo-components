Agentless antivirus protection performs scans on hosts from a centralized system. Agentless systems have become popular for virtualized environments in which multiple OS instances are running on a host simultaneously. Agent-based antivirus running in each virtualized system can be a serious drain on system resources. Agentless antivirus for virtual hosts involves the use of a special security virtual appliance that performs optimized scanning tasks on the virtual hosts. An example of this is VMware\u2019s vShield."

A central authority is responsible for scanning the machines in the enterprise and for initiating all actions on those machines. Agentless systems have a number of advantages over agent-based systems. Strict agent-based systems can only report on machines that have the agent actively running. If the agent has been disabled the machine will appear to not exist. In addition, new machines can be introduced to a network and these rogue machines will not only be agentless, they may well be invisible. Agentless systems, on the other hand, can scan ranges of IP addresses and report on machines it finds. Even if it cannot access the system, the agentless scanner will at least report that a new IP address is present on the network. In many cases agentless systems lower the cost of ownership, reduce management overhead, and provide for quick and easy deployment. This is especially true in large enterprises managing 10,000 or more machines.  An administrator can be scanning and fixing their network within minutes using an agentless system."

BOTH systems utilise a central server to collate results, if they didn't you would have to examine every device to see what was going on. Hence \"centralized admin\" isn't a benefit. The benefit if agent-based protection is that devices will continue to be protected even if they lose connection with the centralized server. Agentless devices will not be scanned if they lose connection with the server because agentless uses \"push\" technology to scan hosts. So for me, the benefit here is that devices are scanned locally and thus remain protected at all times. "

Agent-based protection can often result in higher maintenance costs compared to agentless protection, as there are additional software components that need to be installed, updated, and managed on each device.\n\nB. While some centralized management platforms for agent-based protection may be available, this is not a direct benefit of using agent-based protection over agentless protection.\n\nD. Agent-based protection may allow for the management of numerous devices simultaneously, but this is not a unique advantage when compared to agentless protection, as many agentless solutions also have centralized management capabilities.\n\nSo, the key advantage of agent-based protection over agentless protection is that it allows for the collection and detection of all traffic locally, which can lead to improved performance, greater accuracy, and more comprehensive security coverage. This is because the agent software runs directly on the device, allowing it to collect and analyze all traffic, including local and network traffic, without relying on any external systems."

It manages numerous devices simultaneously.\n\nAgent-based protection allows for centralized management and control of security agents installed on individual devices. This centralized approach enables administrators to manage and monitor multiple devices, often across different platforms and locations, from a single management console or platform. It simplifies the management of security policies, updates, and configurations for all protected devices, making it easier to ensure that security measures are consistently applied and up to date across the organization.\n\nIn contrast, agentless protection typically relies on network-level security controls and may not provide the same level of centralized device management and control. This can make it more challenging to manage a large number of devices and ensure uniform security policies and configurations across the network."

It does this by keeping track of the state of each connection, and only allowing packets that match an established connection to pass through. Stateful inspection can provide basic security against network attacks, such as denial-of-service attacks and spoofing attacks.\n\nDeep packet inspection, on the other hand, operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the network stack. It inspects the contents of each packet in detail, looking for specific application-level information such as URLs, keywords, or file types.

This causes the other devices to update their ARP caches with the attacker's MAC address instead of the actual owner's MAC address.

The term was derived from the corresponding notion of vector in biology. An attack vector may be exploited manually, automatically, or through a combination of manual and automatic activity.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_vector"

But this is not an attack which is seen often and therefore I wouldn't say this to be the right answer.\nIt could also indeed be answer C where the goal is to install several files but this would be more an delivery step then a installation step. Normally you would use the installed files to create a better RCE exploit which allows you to install something malicious on the system itself and from there work on.\nSo I think A is the best answer as it looks more like the threat actor is just trying different sites to see where the code will work."

The cybersecurity analyst knows the steps for a successful exploit.\nProbabilistic Analysis: Statistical techniques are used to determine the probability that a successful exploit will occur based on the likelihood that each step in the exploit will succeed."

In a cybersecurity context, this might involve using a formula to calculate the potential loss from a specific type of attack based on known variables such as the value of the data that could be stolen or the cost of system downtime.\n\nIn contrast, probabilistic analysis involves assigning probabilities to potential outcomes based on known variables. This might involve assessing the likelihood of a specific type of attack succeeding and calculating the expected value of the potential loss."

It also says this in the stealthwatch documentation\n\"After the initial 7 days, Stealthwatch tracks 14 key attributes to create a rolling 28-day\nbaseline. This baseline is the average of the daily attribute values for the past 28 days,\nheavily weighted for the last 7 days. Since the baseline incorporates the last seven\ndays, these are used to represent weekly values. Therefore, the baseline includes\nvalues for the previous month, but is heavily weighted to the most recent week. \"\nSo I would really say B is the right answer."

The goal is to distinguish between malicious and nonmalicious behaviors. The promise of such systems is great: Theoretically, this type of solution can deal with all attacks, both known and unknown. Moreover, it promises to free the user from having to keep the system updated, since there is no use of attack signatures.\n\nA signature is actually a fingerprint of a given attack. The signature captures the actions, which are unique to a given attack. This pragmatic approach is focused on specific attacks and is very accurate at lowering the rate of false positives.\n\nref: https://www.computerworld.com/article/2581345/behavioral-rules-vs--signatures--which-should-you-use-.html"

Rule-based systems have established patterns that do not change with new data.

The main difference between these two methods is how they identify potential threats.\n\nSignature-based detection involves using a predefined set of rules, or signatures, to identify known patterns of malicious activity. These signatures are often based on specific characteristics of a known threat, such as a particular virus or malware strain. When a signature-based system detects a pattern that matches one of these predefined rules, it generates an alert or takes some other action to prevent the attack.\n\nOn the other hand, behavior-based detection focuses on identifying abnormal behavior that may indicate an attack. Instead of using predefined rules or signatures, behavior-based systems analyze patterns of activity to identify anomalies that may be indicative of an attack. For example, a behavior-based system might flag an unusual amount of network traffic from a particular device or identify a user accessing a critical system outside of normal business hours."

When a client connects to a server using SSL/TLS, the server presents its SSL/TLS certificate, which includes a public key. The client then uses this public key to encrypt data that is sent to the server.\n\nThe SSL/TLS certificate provides assurance to the client that they are communicating with the intended server, and that the communication is encrypted and secure.

NetFlow works by capturing traffic at the network layer and generating flow records, which are then exported to a collector for further analysis. NetFlow data is typically used for network traffic analysis, capacity planning, and security monitoring.\n\nTraffic mirroring, on the other hand, involves copying network traffic from a switch port and sending it to another port for analysis. This allows administrators to capture and inspect all of the data contained in the mirrored traffic, including payload content."

        "content": "ARP Spoofing\nAlso known as ARP poisoning, is a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack that allows attackers to intercept communication between network devices. \n\nThe attack works as follows:\nThe attacker must have access to the network. They scan the network to determine the IP addresses of at least two devices\u2060.\nThe attacker uses a spoofing tool such as Arpspoof or Driftnet, to send out forged ARP responses. \nThe forged responses advertise that the correct MAC address for both IP addresses, belonging to the router and workstation, is the attacker\u2019s MAC address. This fools both router and workstation to connect to the attacker\u2019s machine, instead of to each other.\nThe two devices update their ARP cache entries and from that point onwards, communicate with the attacker instead of directly with each other.\nThe attacker is now secretly in the middle of all communications.\n\nhttps://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/arp-spoofing/"

It provides detailed information about traffic flows, including the source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and the amount of data transferred.\n\nNetFlow data is a compact format that summarizes the network traffic data and is therefore an efficient way to build a baseline of traffic seen over an extended period of time. It can help detect patterns of network traffic that may be indicative of security threats or other abnormal activity.\n\nIn contrast, full packet capture and firewall event logs can provide more detailed information about network traffic but can be less efficient in terms of storage and processing requirements. Syslog messages can also provide valuable information, but may not provide the level of detail needed for building a baseline of traffic over an extended period of time."

Ping of death: This is a type of denial of service attack where an attacker sends a ping packet that is larger than the maximum size allowed by the IP protocol. When the target system receives this oversized packet, it can crash or become unresponsive. This type of attack exploits a vulnerability in the target system's network stack and can affect a wide range of systems.\n\nD. UDP flooding: This is a type of denial of service attack where an attacker floods a target system with a large number of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. The target system becomes overwhelmed with the flood of incoming packets, and as a result, legitimate traffic cannot get through. This type of attack can be particularly effective against applications that rely heavily on UDP traffic, such as online gaming or VoIP applications."

It is often surprising how much useful information simple hostnames give out. \n\n-sn (No port scan)\nThis option tells Nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery, and only print out the available hosts that responded to the host discovery probes. This is often known as a \u201cping scan\u201d, but you can also request that traceroute and NSE host scripts be run. This is by default one step more intrusive than the list scan, and can often be used for the same purposes. It allows light reconnaissance of a target network WITHOUT ATTRACTING MUCH ATTENTION.

This includes not only the hardware and software components of the system but also the interfaces, networks, and protocols that allow data to enter and leave the system.\n\nA vulnerability, on the other hand, is an exploitable weakness or flaw in a system or its design that can be used by an attacker to compromise the system's security and gain unauthorized access. Vulnerabilities can exist in hardware, software, network configurations, or even in human behavior.\n\nIn summary, while a vulnerability is a specific weakness or flaw that can be exploited by an attacker, an attack surface is the sum of all possible avenues an attacker can use to gain access to a system or environment and carry out an attack."

If the attacker can get the user to reveal information, it is much easier for the attacker to cause harm rather than use some other method of reconnaissance. This could be done through email or misdirection of web pages, which results in the user clicking something that leads to the attacker gaining information. Social engineering can also be done in person by an insider or outside entity or over the phone."

By configuring network systems to use a cipher suite that supports decryption, the engineer can inspect the traffic for malicious activity, including command and control communications.\n\nThe other options are not correct. Option A, static IP addresses, is not a technology that can be used to decrypt traffic.

Option D, signatures, are used to verify the integrity of a message, but they do not provide encryption."

Of course that a private key and a digital certificate in the end have a suite of ciphers but you need a digital certificate for this, to have a match and not the cipher suite used for that certificate because if you are going on this logic path, ANY certificate issued with the same cypher will work, which is very wrong..........."

By configuring the network systems to decrypt ingress and egress perimeter traffic using a cipher suite, network security devices can inspect the traffic for command and control communications and other malicious outbound communications."

ISO files are commonly used to back up disc contents or distribute software/data on discs.\n\n- CDFS format - CDFS stands for CD File System. It's a file system used to organize files and metadata on CD and DVD discs. \n\n- So in this case, we have an ISO file, which contains a full disc image, and that disc image uses the CDFS format internally.\n\nThe CDFS format is used by Windows natively to organize CD/DVD discs. ISO files are a common format used across Windows, Mac and Linux to back up and distribute disc contents.\n\nTherefore, the ISO file being in CDFS format implies it is an image of a CD that was originally copied or created on a Windows system, using the native CDFS file system.\n\nThe answer is D - data from a CD copied using Windows."

(Eyewitness, Witness, Fingerprint)\n\nPhysical Evidence or Real Evidence\n- It is a material object with a connection to the defendant's potential role in a crime.\nTwo Types of Physical Evidence:\n- Individual Physical Evidence - involves pieces that are unique to a person, such as DNA or fingerprints.\n- Class Physical Evidence -  Relates to a certain segment of the population, which may help professionals narrow down a list of suspects. Examples of class physical evidence include blood type, tire tread and weapon manufacturers.\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/different-types-of-evidence"

It provides a controlled environment where the application can run with restricted access to system resources and sensitive data. This isolation helps prevent the application from causing harm to the host system or other applications and serves as a security mechanism to contain potential threats. The other options, such as application allow lists, application block lists, and host-based firewalls, can be part of a broader security strategy but do not inherently provide the same level of isolation as a sandbox."

The inspection takes place in real-time and in-line with the traffic flow.\n\nB. Traffic mirroring passes live traffic to a tool for blocking - Traffic mirroring, also known as port mirroring or SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer), is a technique for forwarding a copy of network traffic to a monitoring device. The copy of the traffic is sent to a separate tool for analysis, security or other purposes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Inline inspection acts on the original traffic data flow."

NBAR works with quality of services (QoS) features to help ensure that the network bandwidth is best used to fulfill its main primary objectives. The benefits of combining these features include the ability to guarantee bandwidth to critical applications, limit bandwidth to other applications, drop selective packets to avoid congestion, and mark packets appropriately so that the network and the service provider\u2019s network can provide QoS from end to end.\nCisco CyberOps Associate CBROPS 200-201 Official Cert Guide\nBy Omar Santos"

Although the port is TCP443, but it doesn't mean that is a HTTPS traffic! It's only a traffic that use TCP443: for extreme idiot example this traffic would be a telnet traffic with modified port number. \nOn the other hand the HTTP also wrong answer: firstly the wireshark recognise the HTTP also, secondly in this case the bulk data/body is showed in the captured packet as \"Hyperttext Transfer Protocol\" not as simple \"Data [205 byte]\"\nI know there is a \"www\" data in the body, but it isn't mean that is a real HTTP packet.

The monitoring device actively inspects all traffic passing through it, typically at wire speed, and can take action to block or allow specific traffic based on security policies.\n\nIn contrast, tap mode involves using a network tap, which is a device that is inserted into the network without disrupting the normal flow of traffic. The tap makes a copy of the traffic and sends it to a monitoring device for analysis. This means that tap mode can capture traffic as it crosses the network, but at a potentially lower speed than inline mode.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as inline mode monitors traffic path, examining any traffic at a wire speed, while a tap mode monitors traffic as it crosses the network."

NetBIOS is an older transport layer that allows Windows computers to talk to each other on the same network.\nPort 445 - Later versions of SMB (after Windows 2000) began to use port 445 on top of a TCP stack. Using TCP allows SMB to work over the internet.\n\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/smb-port\n\nSMB Ports 139 and 445 are open\nEmail Ports 25 and 110 are closed\nTherefore \"D.

These examples demonstrate what makes incident detection and analysis so difficult: each indicator ideally should be evaluated to determine if it is legitimate. Making matters worse, the total number of indicators may be thousands or millions a day. Finding the real security incidents that occurred out of all the indicators can be a daunting task.\nfrom guide it says this and then,\nthere's the sentence:\n==On the same day an engineer noticed a disabled antivirus software and was not able to determine when or why it occurred. ==\nfor me it's A because it's already detected."

Stateful inspection verifies data at the transport layer, and deep packet inspection verifies data at the application layer.\n\nStateful inspection primarily operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the network protocol stack. It examines the header information of packets and tracks the state of network connections to enforce security policies.\n\nDeep packet inspection, on the other hand, operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the network protocol stack. It involves analyzing the content of packets beyond the header information, allowing for a more granular inspection of the network traffic. Deep packet inspection can identify and analyze specific protocols, applications, and even content within the packets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.

A vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in a system or network that can be exploited by attackers to cause harm, while risk is the likelihood or probability of that harm occurring and its potential impact. In other words, a vulnerability is a security weakness, and risk is the possibility that the vulnerability will be exploited to cause damage or loss. Vulnerabilities are one of the factors that contribute to the overall risk of a system or network, but risk is not the same as vulnerability."

It provides information about network flows, which are essentially records of network communications between devices. This data includes details about network sessions, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and the amount of data transferred during a session. NetFlow is commonly used for network monitoring, traffic analysis, and security purposes, making it particularly useful for obtaining session data. It does not provide full packet capture, application logs, or network downtime reports on its own, but it can be used in conjunction with other tools to support these functionalities."

This type of firewall is considered less resource-intensive compared to deep packet inspection because it only examines a limited set of fields in the packets.\n\nDeep packet inspection (DPI) firewall examines the payload of the packets beyond the header information. DPI can analyze the content of the traffic and block traffic based on characteristics like malware, URLs, or content type. DPI operates on layer 7 of the OSI model, whereas stateful inspection operates on layer 3.\n\nTherefore, D is correct because stateful inspection is capable of TCP state tracking, and deep packet filtering checks only TCP source and destination ports.

These agents collect data locally, perform filtering or preprocessing of the data, and then transmit the relevant or valuable information to the monitoring system. Agent-based monitoring allows for local processing and filtering, which can reduce network utilization by only transmitting essential data.\n\nAgentless monitoring: Agentless monitoring, on the other hand, does not require software agents to be installed on the monitored systems or devices. Instead, it relies on leveraging existing protocols and interfaces, such as APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), to remotely access and retrieve monitoring data from the target systems. Agentless monitoring generally involves higher network utilization as the monitoring system needs to gather data from remote systems over the network."

This is achieved by encoding data within DNS queries or responses, which can then be sent between the endpoints without detection by security systems. DNS tunneling can be used to bypass firewalls, exfiltrate data, or carry out other malicious activities.\n\nDNS amplification, on the other hand, involves exploiting the characteristics of the DNS protocol to amplify the volume of traffic directed at a target server. This is achieved by sending a small DNS query to a DNS server that is configured to respond with a much larger DNS response. The attacker can then spoof the source IP address of the query, causing the amplified response to be sent to the target server. This can result in a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, where the target server is overwhelmed with traffic and becomes unavailable to legitimate users."

Additionally, the logs would show that the *requests and responses contain data* that is not typical of normal DNS traffic, indicating that it is being used to exfiltrate data."

They would be useless in Court. We preserve the evidence.\n- Evidence in cybersecurity investigations that go to court is used to prove (or disprove) facts that are in dispute, as well as to prove the credibility of disputed facts (in particular, circumstantial evidence or indirect evidence).\n- Digital forensics evidence provides implications and extrapolations that may assist in proving some key fact of the case.\n- Such evidence helps legal teams and the court develop reliable hypotheses or theories as to the committer of the crime (threat actor).\n- The reliability of the evidence is vital to supporting or refuting any hypothesis put forward, including the attribution of threat actors."

Phishing attacks typically involve the attacker posing as a trustworthy entity, such as a bank, government agency, or well-known company, to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial information, or personal details. The attacker achieves this by sending an email or message with a link that appears to be legitimate, but in fact leads to a fake website designed to steal the victim's information. In this way, phishing attacks can be used to steal sensitive information and commit fraud or identity theft."

Attackers spoof the source IP address of the DNS query to make it appear as if it originated from the victim's IP address. The DNS servers then send their responses, which can be significantly larger than the original query, to the victim's IP address, flooding it with unwanted traffic.\n\nNTP (Network Time Protocol): NTP amplification attacks exploit the Monlist feature in older versions of NTP servers. Attackers send a specially crafted request to an NTP server, asking for a list of the last clients that connected to it (Monlist). The response generated by the NTP server can be much larger than the request, allowing attackers to amplify their attack traffic. This method is similar to DNS amplification but involves NTP servers instead."

Each connection attempt starts with a SYN flag, and no subsequent flags (such as SYN-ACK or ACK) are visible.\n\nThis pattern indicates a **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack**, specifically a **SYN flood**. In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to a target but does not complete the three-way TCP handshake. This causes the target's resources to become overwhelmed by the half-open connections, potentially leading to service disruption.\n\n### Correct Answer: **D. denial-of-service attack**"
