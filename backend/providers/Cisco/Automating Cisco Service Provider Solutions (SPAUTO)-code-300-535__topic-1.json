The only reason we deploy XTCs in dual pairs is for redundancy purposes and for separation of functions to avoid having that functionality tied to a specified Hardware (under consideration that it runs on any IOS XR platform). So it makes sense to deploy this XTC peer and sync with it to make sure that all PCCs have dual connectivity and do not lose the path computation function should the master XTC fail."

Protocol buffers are one of the core technologies developed and used by Google to serialize data for communication between the elements of highly loaded systems. The reason they are so efficient has to do with the way the data is encoded for transmission: Only key indexes, data types, and values are converted to binary format and sent over the wire\n\nIndexes: The schema identifies an index associated with each variable name, as the names aren\u2019t included in the Protobuf message sent over the wire. It is the indexes that are included. This is very different from XML and JSON data formats, where the actual key names are transferred. The indexes are both an advantage and a disadvantage of the Protobuf: On the one hand, they allow you to save a lot of bandwidth on the wire, especially in bandwidth-hungry applications such as streaming telemetry."
