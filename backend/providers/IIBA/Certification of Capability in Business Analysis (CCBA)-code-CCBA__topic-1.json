It describes how this approach allows the analyst to observe work processes directly and gain insights into informal practices, tasks performed outside formal processes, and potential workarounds.\nUnderstanding Informal Work:\n\nThe use of job shadowing helps identify the \"informal\" or \"ad-hoc\" aspects of work processes that may not be captured in formal documentation. This can provide critical insights into how work is truly performed and highlight areas for improvement or standardization."
