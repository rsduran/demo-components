This understanding helps in managing stakeholder relationships, addressing concerns, and ensuring successful project outcomes.\n\nWhy Not C?\nChanges in business needs: While understanding changes in business needs is crucial for a BA, it is not the primary focus of stakeholder analysis. Changes in business needs are typically identified through requirements elicitation and continuous business analysis activities, not specifically through stakeholder analysis."

Assessing the stability of requirements helps in understanding and managing the risk associated with requirements changes."

The use case that is being extended must be completely functional in its own right and must not depend on the extending use case for its successful execution. This relationship may be used to show that an alternate flow has been added to an existing use case (representing new requirements).<br>Include: allows for the use case to make use of functionality present in another use case. The included use case does not need to be a complete use case in its own right if it is not directly triggered by an actor. This relationship is most often used either when some shared functionality is required by several use cases or to abstract out a complex piece of logic.",

Representations of information may range from highly conceptual or summarized to very detailed. In determining how much detail each stakeholder may require as the initiative evolves, consideration is given to the needs of the stakeholders, the complexity of what is being explained, and the importance of the change. Rather than present the same information to all stakeholders, business analysts should present information with appropriate breadth and level of detail based on each stakeholder's role. Business analysis information regarding a topic of significant importance or high level of risk is frequently represented in greater detail.\n\nBABOK page 44. Correct Answer, C"

There might be a great deal of information needed to conduct elicitation including people, systems, historical data, materials and documents. Documents could include existing system documents, relevant business rules, organizational polices, regulations, and contracts. Supporting materials might also take the form of outputs of analysis work, such as draft versions of analysis models (see Specify and Model Requirements). Business analysts procure or develop the materials and tools needed. Additional planning for experimental elicitation might be required if novel tools, equipment, or techniques are going to be used."

Stakeholder points of view are articulated and addressed to understand any conflicts between the goals\nand objectives of different groups of stakeholders. Assumptions are identified and validated. The objectives that will be met once the problem is solved are clearly specified, and alternative solutions are considered and possibly developed. Alternatives are measured against the objectives to determine which possible\nsolution is best, and identify the value and trade-offs that may exist betweensolutions."
