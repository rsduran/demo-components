The scores are then used to compare and rank the solutions. This systematic approach allows for a more quantitative evaluation and comparison, helping to identify the most suitable solution.\n\nIn practice, you may use acceptance and evaluation criteria within a scoring system. The criteria define what is important, and the scoring system quantifies how well each solution meets those criteria, aiding in the decision-making process."

Hence, each pair of stakeholders adds two channels. However, when we calculate the total number of communication channels, each pair is counted twice (once for each stakeholder in the pair).

It breaks down the project into smaller, more manageable components, providing a hierarchical representation of the work to be done.\nThe Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS) is a hierarchical representation of resources organized by resource category or type, such as labor, equipment, materials, or facilities. RBS primarily focuses on resources allocation and categorization rather than decomposing the program scope and deliverables. Further, RBS is not a terminology used in BABOK v3."

Root cause analysis looks at the main types of causes such as people (human error, lack of training), physical (equipment failure, poor facility), or organizational (faulty process design, poor structure). Root cause analysis helps organize the information in a framework, which allows for deeper analysis if needed.

However, in an agile approach, business analysis activities are integrated throughout the project lifecycle in an iterative and incremental manner.\n\nThe transition to an agile approach affects the timing of when business analysis work is conducted. In agile, requirements may be continually refined and adjusted as the project progresses, and the business analyst's involvement may extend beyond the initial planning phase."

The current success rate on mortgage closures is 80% (24 closures of 30) - again this for 3 months. The new success rate remains the same after implementing the BAs recommendation (80%). What is the average number of successes per month for the mortgage closure process (only that process) if the current process capability were (was -bad grammar) increased by 50%? You increase the number of Transactions for mortgage closures from 30 to 45 (capability) keeping the same 80% success rate. Previously we processed 30 at 80% success = 24 closures. Now we process 45 at 80% success = 36 closures for 3 months. You take that and divide by 3 and you have... 12 Monthly Closures."

    "body": "A business unit of a transnational manufacturer wants to implement a robust process for addressing integrity-critical equipment deterioration incidents. Timely and complete resolution of such incidents is vital for the business unit's continuous safe and profitable operation. Treating each incident involves many employees from different departments extensively collaborating and exchanging information. That information is spread across multiple systems having their access limited to particular user groups. With the current manual process, some incidents get forgotten and remain unresolved for years.<br>The project's Sponsor is an Equipment Integrity and Reliability Advisor, who moved into this position from another business unit. That business unit implemented a proprietary application to integrate the information and to assist in tracking and managing the incidents. Having a positive experience with the application, the<br>Sponsor is suggesting to customize it and reuse in the new business unit.<br>The business unit's Enterprise Architect (EA), who is responsible for assessing solution options and presenting them to executive decision makers, has a few concerns with adopting the existing application. The application uses point-to-point interfaces with other data sources whereas the business unit's target architecture relies on a data warehouse-based integration. Moreover, the two business units use different legacy systems, as well as different front-end implementation technologies. Additionally, the existing application is monolingual, while the business unit needs user interfaces and some data to be presented in two languages. With all of this, it may be easier to build a new application from scratch than to customize the existing one. To understand which option is better, the EA asks a business analyst (BA) to define business requirements.<br>Through the elicitation process, the BA identifies the following requirement: \"Particular incident-related activities require approval by authorized personnel before beginning them, as well as confirmation of acceptance of their completion.\"<br>What kind of asset should the BA provide to fully specify the approval requirement?<br>",

The distributor's management wants to identify and consider more cost-effective options as resorting to adding more trucks and drivers would not be economically feasible.<br>A business analyst (BA) has spent several days observing and measuring the warehouse activities to understand the situation and to gain insights into possible solutions. The delivery workflow is a four-step process: (1) picking the orders and assembling them on trays, (2) bringing the trays to the loading bay, (3) loading the orders into trucks, and (4) delivering the orders to customers. As the following table illustrates, overall performance depends is dependent on five major resources: (1) the workers who pick the orders and load them into trucks, (2) the tallyers who check the orders, (3) the drivers, (4) the trucks, and (5) eight loading bays (LBs).<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03521/0019400001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>What is the company's primary business objective in this scenario?<br>",

    "body": "A very large insurer of General Liability and Property Damage insurance has an upward trend of increased claims over the past 5 years.<br>The Risk Control Area for that company has just completed a 12 month Pilot of a new improved Risk Control Site.<br>The purpose of the site is to help their customers manage their exposures and ideally prevent them from having claims. There were 100 customers that were part of the Pilot that represented 25 different industries. The business goals were to increase use of the site and provide tools to help customer awareness of their exposures, so that they may reduce existing exposures and ultimately reduce claims.<br>The sites Features were as follows:<br>\u2711 Improvements to the search engine to all customers to search for articles, tools and services on the site.<br>\u2711 A checklist function that allow customer to create their own unique Checklists or utilize a sample provided by ABC company to use daily, weekly etc for an area of their facility.<br>\u2711 A promotion feature \"\" where Risk preventing Articles, and tools on the site are marketed toward a customer.<br>\u2711 A profile section allowing for Customer Name, Address and contact Phone number.<br>After the 12 months pilot, the business sponsor received an assessment of what was working and what was not. The Assessment of the pilot revealed overall site activity had significantly increased, however only 5% of the time the promotions were viewed. And the most shocking was that total claims increased by nearly<br>20% for these 100 customers during the pilot period. The business sponsor was perplexed as he had an expectation of reduced claims and at least for 30% viewing of promotions since the project team had spend a lot of careful time and effort on this feature. A BA was assigned to do further analysis regarding the low use of the promotions and why claims were not being reduced.<br>Regarding the use of promotion the BA looked into other similar companies to see what they did differently to get their customer to look at their promotions. The<br>BA found that similar companies had promotions that targeted the industry the customer was in so it was more relevant to them and they were more interested to view the promotion. In addition the BA sent out survey to all 100 pilot customers asking probing questions about what they thought of the site and if they felt it had decreased their exposure to risk sufficiently. The Survey responses came back with raving positive comments and providing examples of how the site had been helping in the reduction of claims from the customer's perspective. In addition the survey also revealed insight that the customers found the promotion often irrelevant to their industry.<br>The BA asked for a dump of all documentation of the 100 claims that were filed over the 12 month pilot period. The BA found the nearly 90% of the claim field were all in one region of the country and were all for property damage related to several severe winter storms in the region and the claims were nearly all unavoidable by the customers. The BA brought all this analysis back to the business sponsor and made the recommendation to the business sponsor to require the customer to select 1 of 25 industries in their profile. This would in turn allow for the ability to show industry specific promotions and promote search results relative to a customer's industry to be stored at the top giving the customer a more personalized experience.<br>What type of recommendation has the BA made to the business sponsor?<br>",

A BA was assigned to do further analysis regarding the low use of the promotions and why claims were not being reduced.<br>Regarding the use of promotion the BA looked into other similar companies to see what they did differently to get their customer to look at their promotions. The<br>BA found that similar companies had promotions that targeted the industry the customer was in so it was more relevant to them and they were more interested to view the promotion. In addition the BA sent out survey to all 100 pilot customers asking probing questions about what they thought of the site and if they felt it had decreased their exposure to risk sufficiently. The Survey responses came back with raving positive comments and providing examples of how the site had been helping in the reduction of claims from the customer's perspective. In addition the survey also revealed insight that the customers found the promotion often irrelevant to their industry.<br>The BA asked for a dump of all documentation of the 100 claims that were filed over the 12 month pilot period. The BA found the nearly 90% of the claim field were all in one region of the country and were all for property damage related to several severe winter storms in the region and the claims were nearly all unavoidable by the customers. The BA brought all this analysis back to the business sponsor and made the recommendation to the business sponsor to require the customer to select 1 of 25 industries in their profile. This would in turn allow for the ability to show industry specific promotions and promote search results relative to a customer's industry to be stored at the top giving the customer a more personalized experience.<br>What was the business sponsor looking to validate about the use of promotions?<br>",

A business analyst (BA) conducted a process improvement workshop and identified the following issues as the top three items to be addressed:<br>1. There are multiple teams to define systems, functionality, and content. In many instances multiple teams are defining the same functionalities while other functionalities are not being defined at all, leading to unclear understanding of business requirements.<br>2. Product specification forms are published each year. A comparison tool is used to evaluate specification between yearly releases, but does not adequately identify changes between versions and needs to be improved.<br>3. Training consists of a new team member shadowing a seasoned team member. There are not written training materials for formal training sources therefore training is inconsistent and not meeting the needs of the organization.<br>Which stakeholders would the BA interview to determine the changes needed to the comparison tool?<br>",

However, for a group of old delivery trucks, it was noticed that the engine sound and vibration disturbed the tracking signal and caused interruptions. Therefore, the tracking does not perform accurately on these vehicles. Although the majority of management would like to sell these vehicles and replace them with newer ones, the Chief<br>Financial Officer (CFO) was strongly against that approach. The CFO argued that instead of hanging tracking devices on the trucks' body, they can have the truck drivers manually send the truck location from a hand held mobile device every 30 minutes.<br>The company has a total of 134 old delivery trucks that have been in service for 10 years. Each vehicle was bought at a price of $22,000. Depreciation is done using a straight line basis and it is estimated that the vehicle depreciates at $1000 per year. The estimated salvage value per vehicle is about $3,000.<br>Another area of tactical improvement for the courier company is pricing. The management strongly believes that they can start a price war with the most aggressive competitor. Management thinks, with their variable cost of $4 per parcel and fixed cost of $6 per parcel, they can win the market. However, after implementing the tracking solution, fixed cost will jump to $8 per parcel which made management reconsider their options. The competitor has variable costs of $5 per parcel and fixed costs o $7 per parcel.<br>In order to align with the added value required from the parcel tracking solution that would be an important requirements' category for the BA to give more focus?<br>",

Implementing a regulatory requirement may depend on the implementation of other related requirements or may necessitate the implementation of certain requirements before others. Therefore, using a \"Dependency\" relationship helps to identify the dependencies between different regulatory requirements and prioritize their implementation accordingly."

    "body": "A bank moves currency from the main office to the branches daily for operational use. To avoid paying overnight interest, the branches return the currency at the end of the business day. The bank requires a new inventory management system to account for the whereabouts of the cash at all times. A software provider has proposed a heavily customized version of their standard inventory management software. As the project progresses, the business analyst (BA) identifies a number of subtleties that would suggest a fully made to order solution may be a better option for the bank. What inputs does the BA need to perform the analysis?<br>",

Potential value and design options\nAccording to the BABOK 7.6 pg 157, the analysis involves estimating and modeling the potential value delivered by different design options. This includes considering potential positive outcomes (benefits) as well as potential negative outcomes (costs) associated with each design option. The potential value is compared between design options to determine which one is most appropriate to meet the enterprise's requirements. Therefore, the potential value and design options are essential inputs for the BA to assess and recommend a solution."
