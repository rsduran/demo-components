The distributed architecture of Aruba VSX enables each member of the virtual switch to have its own dedicated control plane, which helps to reduce latency and improve overall network performance.\n\nYes, Aruba VSX allows upgrading members with near-zero downtime or loss of packets. This is because Aruba VSX uses a distributed architecture that allows for hitless software upgrades, where software can be upgraded on one member at a time without affecting the operation of the other members. This means that network administrators can upgrade the software on individual members of the virtual switch without any disruption to the overall network operation."

It's interesting to note that with Aruba switches, front plane stacking, such as VSX and VSF uses shortest-path forwarding by default. This means that if there is an upstream / downstream LAG it will take this path first before using the load balancing hashing algorithm. the hashing algorithm kicks in if there is more than one uplink / downlink port on a single member VSF/VSX switch. The reason for shortest-path forwarding (I just made up that term - not sure what we call it inside Aruba) is it reduces the potential traffic across the VSF/VSX links as traffic will prefer the direct path, not the ISL path. This can play an important part in the design of VSF/VSX as you might not need 8 ports between your member switches - but it depends what your uplinks are and how much east-west traffic there is."

If it is, it leaves the tag intact, and sends the frame. If VLAN 10 is not allowed, it drops the frame\n4. Switch 2 receives the frame on tagged port 1. This switch also determines if VLAN 10 is allowed on this port, and drops it if it is not. Switch 2 determines that port 2 should send the frame\n5.

It is a form of packet filtering that locates, identifies, classifies and reroutes or blocks packets with specific data or code payloads that conventional packet filtering, which examines only packet headers, cannot detect."
