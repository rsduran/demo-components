These series are typically targeted for more demanding network environments where high availability and redundancy are critical.\n\nIf you require high availability and dual-control planes, it is recommended to consider the Aruba 5400R zl2 or Aruba 8400 series switches or consult the official Aruba documentation to explore other switch models that meet your specific requirements."

BFD was designed to be fast, its packets can be processed by some interface modules or line cards so there isn\u2019t much overhead.\n\nBFD runs independent from any other (routing) protocols. Once it\u2019s up and running, you can configure protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, HSRP, MPLS LDP etc. to use BFD for link failure detection instead of their own mechanisms.

They have implemented 802.1X authentication on access ports where laptop and IOT devices typically connect. An administrator has noticed that for POE devices, the AOS-CX switch ports are delivering the maximum wattage to the port instead of what the device actually needs. Upon connecting the IoT devices, the devices request the maximum wattage through information exchange.<br>Concerned about this waste of electricity, what should the administrator implement to solve this problem?<br>",

So i think this ACL is not valid, by the way, the only answer that matches the ACL entries is the C BUT it matches the first entry, so it will never generate a log, but a counter increment.

But then the traffic is forwarded as regular traffic on the switch port, so the switch would also attempt to perform authentication of this client. Since the 802.1X traffic of the client is terminated at the IAP, the switch would attempt to perform MAC authentication for the client MAC address. This is unnecessary and confusing, since ClearPass would see the same MAC address as 802.1X authenticated on the IAP, and MAC-authenticated on the switch port. For this scenario, the switch can be set to \u2018port-based\u2019 authentication; that is, device mode."
