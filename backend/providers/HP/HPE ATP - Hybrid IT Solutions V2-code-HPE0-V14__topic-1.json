There  are  no  unnecessary  \u201cgeometry\u201d limitations such as library slots, cartridge sizes, and so on. The catalyst\nallows ISV software to be aware of the StoreOnce Backup system and its capabilities. The backup server is able to support node failover on multinode systems without complex restart scripts and restart from checkpoints. It also uses bandwidth-efficient methods to move (copy) data without rehydration. This enables backup over WAN or LAN, with increased performance."

Logically pooling resources reduces both underutilization and overprovisioning to create a more agile, cost-effective data center. A unified management interface integrates formerly siloed infrastructure and operations and allows IT to be offered as a service, enabling modern DevOps practices to be adopted by organizations with critical legacy applications that need to remain on premises."
