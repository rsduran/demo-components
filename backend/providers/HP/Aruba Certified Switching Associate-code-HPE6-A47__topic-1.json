You might have suggested one of three approaches: one VLAN per floor, one VLAN per building, or one VLAN per campus. The one VLAN per floor approach is not recommended because it interferes with roaming and adds complexity. If you did take this approach, the /24 subnets are not large enough for the requirements on every floor. You would need to ask for /23 subnets.\nThe one VLAN per building approach would work if you considered each building its own RF domain. It provides roaming within a building and, if you are using a single cluster at the data center, between buildings. If you deployed two MCs or clusters, one at each building, though, GRE tunneling would be required to support roaming between buildings."

        "content": "Starting from ArubaOS 8.0.0.0, an AP can fail over between clusters. Redundancy across geographically separated data centers are supported. An AP terminates on an AAC in a cluster. If a member in the cluster fails, the AP will fails over to the S-AAC in the same cluster. If the AP is unable to establish communication with any of the members in the first cluster, then it terminates on another cluster setup in the backup data center. It terminates on another cluster only if the other cluster member IP is provided in the AP system profile as backup LMS.\n\nFor example, a cluster with four managed devices is deployed in the West Coast data center. Similarly, a cluster with four managed devices is deployed in the East Coast data center. An AP is configured to have a primary termination on the West Coast data center and backup termination on the East Coast data center. If a managed device fails in the West Coast data center, then the AAC moves to another managed device in the same data center. However, if the entire West Coast data center is inaccessible to the AP, then it fails over to the East Coast data center."
