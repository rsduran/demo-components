Typically, when a device cannot authenticate, the RADIUS server sends a RADIUS Reject message, and the switch port denies access. However, for a captive portal solution, ClearPass, as the RADIUS server, behaves differently. It uses a service with a special type of MAC-Auth (called Allow All MAC-Auth). When a device fails authentication, this service matches the device to a \u201cdeny any\u201d profile rather than simply rejects the access. The profile defines various RADIUS attributes and VSAs to apply to the device\u2019s session."

The exhibits also indicate whether VLAN 20 is statically configured on each link, either as an untagged or a tagged VLAN. If the link has no label, VLAN 20 is not statically configured on that link.<br>A network administrator needs to deploy AOS-Switches at the access layer. They enforce 802.1X on edge ports. In the exhibits, Switch-1 represents the access layer switches. The plan calls for users to be dynamically assigned to VLAN 20 or VLAN 30, based on identity. If the RADIUS server authorizes the user but does not assign a VLAN, the user should be assigned to VLAN 30. Switch-2 is the default router for the user VLANs.<br>Which exhibit shows the correct plan for VLAN 20 in the wired infrastructure?<br>",
