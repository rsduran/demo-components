You can select an NVIDIA Tesla accelerator tray, an Intel accelerator tray, or an AMD\naccelerator tray. You can then install up to two accelerators of the corresponding type in the tray (NVIDIA\nTesla K40, Tesla K80, Tesla M60, Tesla M60 LAF, or Grid K1 Quad GPUs, Intel Xeon Phi 5110P or\n7120P coprocessors, or AMD FirePro S9150 GPUs, as of the publication of this course). To make room\nfor the accelerators, the XL250a is a double-width server tray. Therefore, the density of servers perchassis is lower\u2014five 2P servers per-chassis. However, for the right HPC applications, the accelerators\ncan more than make up for this lower density."
