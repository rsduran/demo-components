If you want to load-balance between the two devices, it may be good to have two virtual IPs which can mutually fail over. For just redundancy, a single VIP is fine. And you can also still use the radius server backup in your switches, APs, etc, but that in general is slower than a virtual IP on the ClearPass. I found that this works for me, in other situations different approaches may work. Also, if you are at the point where the choice between one or multiple VIPs really makes impact, you probably should have a look at an external network load balancer as that is even faster and much more flexible in how you route/distribute your traffic.\"\n\nBE is correct"
