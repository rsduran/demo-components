Some of the benefits of HPE GreenLake include:\n\nCustomers can control costs since advanced metering allows them to only pay for what is used: HPE GreenLake offers a pay-per-use model that aligns costs with actual usage, reducing overprovisioning and improving cash flow. Customers can also scale up or down as needed and only pay for what they use.\n\nHPE actively monitors, manages, and deploys capacity ahead of demand so the customer can scale with ease within an installed buffer: HPE GreenLake provides customers with buffer capacity that is ready to use in minutes, not months, enabling them to respond quickly to changing business needs. Customers can also access a range of cloud services from HPE and partners through a self-service portal."
