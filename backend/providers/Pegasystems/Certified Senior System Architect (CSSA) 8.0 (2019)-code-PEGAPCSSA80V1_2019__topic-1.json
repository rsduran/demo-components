Currently, there is an evaluation subprocess in which a physician reviews the diagnosis and enters the recommended procedure and its urgency. The request then advances to a medical director who analyzes the feedback and approves the appropriate procedure. The health care organization has created a new requirement, which states that three physicians can perform the evaluation independently.<br>Only two evaluations are necessary to advance the case to the medical director.<br>In order to allow the three physicians to review the orders in parallel, how would you configure the process?<br>",
