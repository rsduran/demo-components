Data pages provide a performance improvement for Pega Platform\u2122 applications by caching information in memory, rather than querying a data store, such as a database or web service. Data pages typically return either a list of items or information about a single item. \n\nTo provide instant access to a particular item in a list-structure data page, you can enable keyed access. By using keyed access, you avoid maintaining two separate data pages: one page to return a list of items and a second page to return information about a single item. Using a keyed data page when retrieving data for application use can make processing more efficient by reducing the number of exchanges with a system of record."
