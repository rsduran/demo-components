For customers that lack the expertise in house to deploy and manage converged systems, appliances offer a \u201csimple-to-procure, deploy, and manage\u201d option. As with blocks, appliances also are based on a SINGLE  personality where a customer can add a single cloud layer on these systems.\n\nThis next category of Racks is where we start to look at application transformation.\n\nRacks come in two flavors:\n\nTurn-key cloud or application systems, which in addition to the hardware and hypervisor layers also offer a complete single cloud or application experience out of the factory, built to customer specifications and systems that offer the ability to support multiple personas on top of a common hardware platform. Customers can then add one or more cloud deployment models to deliver applications to fit their business and application needs. These systems provide the flexibility of not only multiple personas, but also the ability to scale storage independently of the compute."

CPU, RAM, and disk are allocated to the service, along with the proper network connection. \nThe orchestration mechanism can also trigger the creation of other service options, like creating a backup schedule for a service, or provisioning metering and monitoring. \nThe catalog and orchestration mechanism can also track the time that a service is made available and then what to do at lease expiration. \nOnce the service is created, the consumer is alerted and can start consumption."

Examples of fixed costs are compute, memory, storage, network, load balancers, firewalls, licensing , power, and cooling.\n\nVariable costs identify administrative and operational activities to be performed and assigns a cost to each activity. These are typically indirect, or overhead, operational expenditures. Examples of variable costs include Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) for development, administration and server, storage and network administrators, cloud operators and administrators, developers, operators, and support engineers"

The goal is applications that continue to function\u2015even if the underlying physical hardware fails or is removed or replaced. One way to accomplish this goal is to avoid \u201csingle points of failure.\u201d For example, having a distributed architecture supporting multiple instances, allows the infrastructure to reorganize service workloads as required."
