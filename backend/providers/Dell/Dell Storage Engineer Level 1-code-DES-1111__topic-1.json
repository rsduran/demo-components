VSI shows the properties of the datastores. To provision and manage PowerMax and VMAX All Flash, VSI requires a supported version of PowerMaxOS and Unisphere for PowerMax 9.x. The ESXi hosts must have a masking view on the array, and the array must be registered in Dell EMC VSI."

This is because the Host I/O limits are set at 10,000 IOPS . The Dynamic Distribution policy is set to OnFailure, which means that if a port fails, the system will automatically redistribute the I/O load to the remaining ports in the Port Group . Since the director remains online, the Storage Group can still achieve the maximum IOPS of 10,000"
