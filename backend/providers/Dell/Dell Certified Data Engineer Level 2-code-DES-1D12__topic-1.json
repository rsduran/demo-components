So if you need more throughput than 8x 10Gb iSCSI ports are able to deliver, you'll need to go for FC front-end."

        "content": "According to the SC Series sizing course notes: \n\"Why size front-end ports based on double the peak throughput? Remember that in a\nclustered or dual-controller design, it is best practice to account for operation of the\narray in a failover condition. When a dual-controller solution is in production, the\nactive-active controllers share the total front-end throughput. If a controller is down for\nmaintenance or as the result of failure, the single remaining controller will handle\n100% of the front-end traffic.\"\nSO I think 10Gb = 600MB/s therefore 4687/600 = 7.8 = 8 cards per controller which will bring the total front end ports to a minimum of 16. So answer would be D. Got similar question in EMC practise exam right with this reasoning."

This is an optional Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae application that monitors the systems participating in synchronous replication for critical failures or outages. If a failure or outage is detected, MetroSync Manager automatically initiates a cabinet-level failover to simultaneously fail over all synchronously replicated NAS servers and associated VMware vSphere NFS \ndatastores to the peer system in parallel. Just as MetroSync synchronous replication works bi-directionally between two systems, MetroSync Manager does as well. If either system fails or becomes unavailable, MetroSync Manager performs the necessary cabinet-level failover to the surviving system. Like manual failover, when a system becomes unavailable, synchronous replication between it and the destination system stops."

For the PowerStore T model, these ports are internally referred to as the system bond. This interface is created to ensure that there is no single point of failure and data services and production data are always available. Below shows a list of different types of traffic that flows through the system bond if the data services are leveraged on the PowerStore system:\n\n\u2022 Management traffic (for PowerStore X models)\n\u2022 Cluster communication\n\u2022 iSCSI host traffic\n\u2022 Replication traffic\n\u2022 NAS traffic (for PowerStore T models)\n\nDell EMC PowerStore: Introduction to the Platform | H18149.6"

FSN is a high availability feature that extends link failover into the network by providing switch-level redundancy. FSN appears as a single link with a single MAC address and potentially multiple IP addresses. FSN can consists of Ethernet ports, link aggregations, or any combination of the two. FSN adds an extra layer of availability to link aggregations alone as link aggregations provide availability in the event of a port failure while FSN provides availability in the\nevent of a switch failure. Each port or Link aggregation is considered as a single connection and only the primary port or link aggregation in an FSN is active at a time. All ports in an FSN must have the same MTU size, but the speed and duplex settings can vary."

We\u2019re not going to balance and put a bunch of stuff in nearline when there's plenty of SSD space available. What happens is, once that tier reaches 90%, we start to spill data down into the \nnext tier: 90% on the SSD, then we spill into the 10K or 15K whatever that next \ntier is, and then once that hits 90%, then we\u2019ll tier down to the nearline. If you \nhave 100TB pool and 50TB of that is SSD and 10K and you've only got 40TB of \ndata\u2026guess what\u2026it\u2019s going to perform really, really well.\n.- So the answer is C (not D, the 5% percent is other thing, is about pools are recommended to have a 5% flash in them)."
