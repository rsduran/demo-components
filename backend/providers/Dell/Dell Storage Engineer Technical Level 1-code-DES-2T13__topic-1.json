It also helps to predict future requirements. To monitor PaaS development environment utilization, response, and event, the application tool that is best suited should be considered during designing. The effectiveness of a metering solution relies on the visibility into how cloud resources are used. You may have to consider a single metering and billing solution when services are deployed in a private or public cloud. You have to use a unified metering solution, if deployed across multiple clouds. Example: Amazon Cloud Watch: It collects and track metrics, monitors logfiles, set alarms, and automatically reacts to changes of AWS resources. \nCorrect D"
