There is two optons cab be performed  in case of XIO  connected:\nDX_Lite  1/3 of EFD are external\nDX_Heavy 2/3 of EFD are external\n6. According options we have DX_Hevay is the closest.\nBUT!\nI have doubts 'bout understaning the phrase \"How can the existing infrastructure be leverage while minimizing increased storage capacity?\"\nWhat does it mean \"leverage\" in this sentence?  utilize, using or enhance or strenghten ?\nAnd what the question is about capacity?
