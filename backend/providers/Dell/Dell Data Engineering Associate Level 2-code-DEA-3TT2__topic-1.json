The primary disadvantage to incremental backups is that they can be time-consuming to restore.\n\nFor example, a full backup is created on Sunday, and incremental backups are created for the rest of the week. Monday's backup would contain only the data that has changed since Sunday. Tuesday's backup would contain only the data that has changed since Monday and so forth.  To restore the data to Thursday, it would require the restore of 5 backups (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday)."

This conserves disk space and allows multiple VMs to use the same software installation. Linked clones make it easier to create unique virtual machines for individual tasks. They are also easier to share among people who need access to the same virtual disks (like support and dev teams)."

This is achieved by generating a unique content address for each object and validating the content address for stored objects at regular intervals. Content authenticity is assured because the address assigned to each object is as unique as a fingerprint. Every time an object is read, CAS uses a hashing algorithm to recalculate the object\u2019s content address as a validation step and compares the result to its original content address. If the object fails validation, CAS rebuilds the object using a mirror or parity protection scheme."

Then, we divide the uptime by the number of failures.\n\nFirst, we calculate the operating hours:\n\nThe system operates 24 hours a day from Monday to Saturday.\nThere are 6 operating days in a week.\nThus, the total operating time in a week is 24 hours/day * 6 days = 144 hours.\nNext, we calculate the total system failure time during the week:\n\nTuesday: 5 A.M. to 7 A.M. (2 hours)\nThursday: 4 P.M. to 8 P.M. (4 hours)\nFriday: 8 A.M. to 11 A.M. (3 hours)\nSum of failure hours: 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 hours\nThe total uptime in a week is 144 hours (total operating time) - 9 hours (failure time) = 135 hours.\n\nFinally, we calculate the MTBF by dividing the uptime by the number of failures:\n\nMTBF = 135 hours / 3 failures = 45 hours.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 45 hours"

Lower RTO and RPO increase the cost\n\nWhen designing a disaster recovery plan based on RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective), one of the key considerations is that lower RTO and RPO values typically increase the cost of the solution. This is because achieving shorter recovery times and minimizing data loss requires more robust infrastructure, advanced technologies, and potentially more frequent data replication, all of which can drive up the overall cost of the disaster recovery plan."
