This means that the host will still be able to access the data on the source system, and the import process will not disrupt the host's I/O operations.\n\nThis is a key point to consider when managing import sessions, as it allows administrators to pause the import process without disrupting the host's access to the data.\n\nIn relation to the previous question, this means that the data path from the host to the PowerStore system does not become the active I/O path until the import session is completed, and the host is actively using the PowerStore system for I/O operations. Until then, the host will continue to use the source system for I/O operations, even if the import session is paused."
