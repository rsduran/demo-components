So, to achieve 2 TB (2000 GB), you'd need 2000 GB / 250 GB per drive = 8 disk drives.\nNext, let's consider the IOPS requirement during peak workloads:\nThe application is expected to generate 4500 IOPS with a typical I/O size of 4 KB. Each drive can perform a maximum of 90 IOPS with a 70% utilization. To calculate the number of drives needed for IOPS, divide the required IOPS by the maximum IOPS per drive: 4500 IOPS / 90 IOPS per drive = 50 drives\nTherefore, for a RAID 0 configuration to meet both the capacity and performance requirements (considering the higher number between capacity and performance), you would need a minimum of 50 disk drives."

In port zoning, access to node is determined by the physical switch port to which a node is connected. The zone members are the port identifiers (switch domain ID and port number) to which FC HBA and its targets (storage systems) are connected. If a node is moved to another switch port in the fabric, port zoning must be modified to enable the node, in its new port, to participate in its original zone. However, if an FC HBA or storage system port fails, an administrator has to replace the failed device without changing the zoning configuration."

Fibre Channel SANs can be zoned according to the World Wide Name (WWN) of each device, or according to switch ports.\nWWN zoning groups a number of WWNs in a storage-area network zone and allows them to communicate with each other. The switch port that each device is connected to is irrelevant when WWN zoning is configured. An advantage to this type of zoning is that if a port is suspected of being faulty, another port can be used without the need for fabric reconfiguration. A disadvantage with WWN zoning is that if there's a host bus adapter (HBA) failure, the fabric will need to be reconfigured for the host to reconnect to its storage. WWN zoning is sometimes referred to as soft zoning."

It shows connectivity between a compute system with an iSCSI initiator and a storage system with an FC port. As the storage system does not have any iSCSI port, a gateway or a multiprotocol router is used. The gateway facilitates the communication between the compute system with iSCSI ports and the storage system with only FC ports. The gateway converts IP packets to FC frames and conversely, thus bridging the connectivity between the IP and FC environments. The gateway contains both FC and Ethernet ports to facilitate the communication between the FC and the IP environments.

A full mesh topology may be appropriate when the number of switches involved is small. A typical deployment would involve up to four switches or directors, with each of them servicing highly localized host-to-storage traffic. In a full mesh topology, a maximum of one ISL or hop is required for host-to-storage traffic. However, with the increase in the number of switches, the number of switch ports used for ISL also increases. &lt;&lt;This reduces the available switch ports for node connectivity.&gt;&gt;\"\n\nInformation Storage and Management .

Organizations are now looking for ways to transport data over a long distance between their disparate SANs at multiple geographic locations. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to interconnect geographically dispersed SANs through reliable, high-speed links. This approach involves transporting the FC block data over the IP infrastructure. FCIP is a tunneling protocol that enables distributed FC SAN islands to be interconnected over the existing IP-based networks. The FCIP standard has rapidly gained acceptance as a manageable, cost-effective way to blend the best of the two worlds: FC SAN and the proven, widely deployed IP infrastructure. &lt;&lt;As a result, organizations now have a better way to store, protect and move their data by leveraging investments in their existing IP infrastructure. FCIP is extensively used in disaster recovery implementations in which data is duplicated to the storage located at a remote site.&gt;&gt;\n\nInformation Storage and Management . Wiley.

With VM storage migration, organization can make it easier and faster to embrace new storage platforms. This is to adopt flexible leasing models, retire older systems, and conduct storage upgrades.\n\u2022 Dynamically optimize storage I/O performance: With storage migration, IT administrators can move VM disk files to alternative LUNs that are properly configured to deliver optimal performance. This migration avoids scheduled downtime, eliminating the time and cost associated with traditional methods.\n\u2022 Efficiently manage storage capacity: Nondisruptive VM disk file migration to different classes of storage enables cost-effective management of VM disks as part of a tiered storage strategy.\""

In a multisite replication, data from the source site is replicated to two or more remote sites. The illustration provides an example of a three-site remote replication solution. In this approach, data at the source is replicated to two different storage systems at two different sites. The source-to-bunker site (target 1) replication is synchronous with a near-zero RPO. The source-to-remote site (target 2) replication is asynchronous with an RPO in the order of minutes. The key benefit of this replication is the ability to fail over to either of the two remote sites in the case of source-site failure."

Additional writes on the source cannot occur until each preceding write has been completed and acknowledged. This ensures that data is identical on the source and replica at all times. Further, writes are transmitted to the remote site exactly in the order in which they are received at the source. Therefore, write ordering is maintained.
