GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) is a block cipher mode of operation that uses universal hashing over a binary Galois field to provide authenticated encryption. And finally, CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) is a mode of operation for a block cipher - one in which a sequence of bits are encrypted as a single unit, or block, with a cipher key applied to the entire block. I didn't come across GCM or CBC in any of the ECS documentation. Therefore, answer: A."
