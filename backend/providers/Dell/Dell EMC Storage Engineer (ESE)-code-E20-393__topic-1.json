When logging into Unisphere for the first time, license installation appears as a step of the Unisphere Configuration Wizard, prompting the administrator to install the license file obtained from EMC. If this license file includes D@RE functionality, D@RE will be enabled once the license file is installed successfully<br>Note: Unity storage systems address sensitive data concerns through controller-based Data at Rest Encryption (D@RE), which encrypts stored data as it is written to disk.<br>D@RE is a license controlled feature available by default on Unity storage systems, and, being designed to be largely invisible to administrative end users, requires almost no effort to enable or manage.

This architecture avoids a performance penalty that Copy on First Write technology has when existing data is changed. With Redirect on Write technology, when a snapshot is taken, the existing data on the storage object remains in place and provides the snapshot point-in-time view of the data. Production data access also uses this view to read existing data. Another benefit of Redirect on Write is that no storage resource is needed to create a snapshot. With Copy on First Write technology, a storage resource had to be reserved to hold original data that changed to preserve the point-in-time view. As its name implies, with Redirect on Write technology, when writes are made to the storage object, those writes are redirected to a new location allocated as needed from the parent pool in 256 megabyte stripes. New writes are stored in 8 kilobyte chunks on the newly allocated stripe. Reads of the new writes are serviced from this new location as well.\""
