It can easily adjust to evolving technologies, workloads, and demands without requiring significant reconfiguration or rebuilding.\n\nSoftware-defined: Modern infrastructure leverages software-defined principles, where the management and control of infrastructure resources are abstracted and controlled through software. This allows for greater agility, automation, and programmability in managing and provisioning resources, enabling organizations to respond quickly to changing demands.\n\nScale-out: Modern infrastructure is built to scale-out, meaning it can easily expand its capacity by adding additional resources or nodes. It allows for horizontal scalability, where organizations can incrementally add resources to meet growing demands, ensuring high performance and availability."

While this isolation provides several benefits, such as enhanced compatibility and easier application management, it does not eliminate the need for OS modifications.\n\nIn contrast, option B suggests that application virtualization removes the requirement to modify the operating system. However, application virtualization does not directly impact the need for OS modifications. Modifying the operating system may still be necessary for various reasons, such as security updates, patches, or configuration changes unrelated to application virtualization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question remains:\n\nA.
