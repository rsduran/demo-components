        "content": "To meet the requirements, the replication connection mode must be set to Both, which allows both synchronous and asynchronous replication sessions to be configured on the same connection. This way, block resources can use synchronous replication, which ensures zero data loss, and file resources can use asynchronous replication, which allows some data difference on the destination. Setting Unisphere resource filtering to All is not necessary, as it only affects the display of resources in the Unisphere GUI. Setting an RPO of 0 on the synchronous replication sessions is redundant, as synchronous replication always has an RPO of 0. Configuring the replication interfaces on the 4-port mezzanine card is not relevant, as it only affects the performance and availability of the replication network."
