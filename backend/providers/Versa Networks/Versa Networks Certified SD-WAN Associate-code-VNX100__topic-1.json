This is accomplished by using a simple drag-and-drop command to define the service chain, for example third party WAN optimization. Relevant service chain templates can be attached to required device groups, and these too can be easily duplicated by using a cloning tool.\n\nTemplates that automate configuration allow administrators to easily divide and conquer their network, while achieving operational excellence. Re-using templates improves productivity and streamlines the entire deployment process, while implementing a modular methodology and eliminating configuration errors. Network monitoring and analytics are also enhanced, generating granular dashboards for network availability, application usage, top sites and circuits by bandwidth, top applications and usage, and a global site-to-site geo map."
