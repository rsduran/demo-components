Information provided to stakeholders related to risk should include potential impact and the plans for responding to each risk. This communication is on-going and should occur in parallel with the four sequential steps discussed thus far\"\"risk identification, assessment, prioritization and mitigation. The Scrum Team may also discuss specific risks related to their Tasks with the Scrum Master during Daily Standup Meetings. The Product Owner is responsible for the prioritization of risks and for communicating the prioritized list to the<br>Scrum Team. An important tool which can be used for communicating information related to risks is the Risk Burndown Chart.<br>Reference:<br>http://blog.scrumstudy.com/risk-management-in-scrum/",

A skills matrix maps the skills, capabilities, and interest level of team members in using those skills and capabilities on a project. Using this matrix, the organization can assess any skill gaps in team members and identify the employees who will need further training in a particular area or competency. Team members may not always possess the required knowledge or skills to work in the Scrum environment. The Product Owner should evaluate the training needs of potential team members and facilitate training to bridge any knowledge gaps in the team.<br>Reference:<br>http://blog.scrumstudy.com/preparing-an-organization-for-implementing-scrum-to-deliver-projects/",
