In addition, you can also assign granular privileges by layer or sub-policy to distribute workload and tasks to the most qualified administrators<br>\u2711 With layers, the rule base is organized into a set of security rules.  These set of rules or layers, are inspected in the order in which they are defined, allowing control over the rule base flow and the security functionalities that take precedence. If an \u05d2\u20acaccept\u05d2\u20ac action is performed across a layer, the inspection will continue to the next layer. For example, a compliance layer can be created to overlay across a cross-section of rules.<br>\u2711 Sub-policies are sets of rules that are created for a specific network segment, branch office or business unit, so if a rule is matched, inspection will continue through this subset of rules before it moves on to the next rule.<br>\u2711 Sub-policies and layers can be managed by specific administrators, according to their permissions profiles.

Create SmartConsole objects that use the valid (NATed) IP addresses. Create NAT rules to translate the original IP addresses of the objects to valid IP addresses. Then configure the Firewall Rule Base to allow traffic to the applicable translated objects with these valid IP addresses.\n\nNote - For manual NAT rules, it is necessary to configure Proxy ARP entries to associate the translated IP address.\n\nThese are some situations that must use manual NAT rules:\n\nRules that are restricted to specified destination IP addresses and to specified source IP addresses\nTranslate both source and destination IP addresses in the same packet.\nStatic NAT in only one direction\nTranslate services (destination ports)\nRules that only use specified services (ports)\nTranslate IP addresses for dynamic objects"

This means that the fw will intercept this http authentication to the server, and (i suppose) will redirect us to a fw-1 http window where to authenticate. This exactly matches the condition on rule 4, because now we will be connecting to the fw, so it will drop this and so the redirection to http on the fwsingapore wont appear and we wont be able to authenticate through the fw and therefore also not with our destination server."

During the phase, SAs are negotiated on\nbehalf of services such as IPSec, the shared-secret key material is determined, and an\nadditional DH occurs. Once the two computers reach an agreement, two SAs are\nestablished, one for outbound communication and the other for inbound\ncommunication. The following process occurs:\n- More key material is exchanged and IPSec authentication and encryption parameters\nare agreed on.\n- The DH key is combined with the key material to produce the symmetrical IPSec key.\n- IPSec keys are generated."

This path is also referred to as\nthe Slow Path.\n\u2022 Accelerated Path \u2014 Packets and connections that are offloaded from the Firewall to\nSecureXL. These packets and connections are quickly processed.\n\u2022 Medium Path \u2014 Packets that cannot use the accelerated path because they require\ndeeper inspection. Although it is not necessary for the Firewall to inspect these packets,\nthey can be offloaded by another feature. For example, packets that are examined by\nIPS cannot use the accelerated path and can be offloaded to the IPS Passive Streaming\nLibrary (PSL), which provides stream reassembly for TCP connections. As a result,\nSecureXL processes these packets quicker than packets on the slow path.\n\ni think this is medium path, because traffic need to be checked by antivirus"

This is the case in High Availability mode, where all connections are routed through the same cluster member, and hence, sticky. This is also the case in Load Sharing mode when there are no VPN peers, static NAT rules or SIP.\n\nIn Load Sharing mode, however, there are cases where it is necessary to ensure that a connection that starts on a specific cluster member will continue to be processed by the same cluster member in both directions. To that end, certain connections can be made sticky by enabling the Sticky Decision Function.\n\nRelevant just for Load sharing. The answer is A."

These\npackets and connections are not processed by SecureXL. This path is also referred to as\nthe Slow Path.\n\u2022 Accelerated Path \u2014 Packets and connections that are offloaded from the Firewall to\nSecureXL. These packets and connections are quickly processed.\n\u2022 Medium Path \u2014 Packets that cannot use the accelerated path because they require\ndeeper inspection. Although it is not necessary for the Firewall to inspect these packets,\nthey can be offloaded by another feature. For example, packets that are examined by\nIPS cannot use the accelerated path and can be offloaded to the IPS Passive Streaming\nLibrary (PSL), which provides stream reassembly for TCP connections. As a result,\nSecureXL processes these packets quicker than packets on the slow path."

The priority algorithm subtracts the priority delta from the priority value to calculate an effective priority. If you configure your system correctly, the effective priority will be lower than the backup gateway priority in the other Virtual Routers. This causes the problematic master to fail over for the other Virtual Routers as well."

First, user management in User Directory is handled externally and\nnot locally. Secondly, User Directory server templates, unlike internal user templates, can be\nmodified and applied to users dynamically. This means that user definitions are easy to change and manage. Changes that are applied to a User Directory template are reflected immediately for all users who are using that template"

Therefore, more than one user can have open sessions from the same IP address. When this occurs, the permissions for each account remain active until their User/IP association timeout occurs. In this scenario, there is a risk that currently connected users can access network resources, for which they do not have permissions.\n\nhttps://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R80.20_GA/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R80.20_IdentityAwareness_AdminGuide/html_frameset.htm?topic=documents/R80.20_GA/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R80.20_IdentityAwareness_AdminGuide/149265"

This industry includes cyber-criminals, malware operators, tool providers, coders, and affiliate programs. Their \"products\" can be easily ordered online from numerous sites (for example, do-it-yourself malware kits, spam sending, data theft, and denial of service attacks) and organizations are finding it difficult to fight off these attacks.<br>\u2711 Ideological and state driven attacks that target people or organizations to promote a political cause or carry out a cyber-warfare campaign.<br>Both of these trends are driven by bot attacks.<br>A bot is malicious software that can invade your computer. There are many infection methods. These include opening attachments that exploit a vulnerability and accessing a web site that results in a malicious download.<br>Reference:<br>https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R77/CP_R77_ThreatPrevention_WebAdmin/102176.htm",
