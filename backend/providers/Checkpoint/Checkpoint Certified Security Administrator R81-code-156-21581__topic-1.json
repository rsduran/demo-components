Ports can be dynamically opened and closed if necessary for completing a transaction. For example, when you make a connection to a server using HTTP, the server will initiate a new connection back to your system on a random port. A stateful inspection firewall will automatically open a port for this return connection.\n\nStateful inspection firewalls are considered more secure than packet filtering firewalls. Stateful inspection firewalls process application layer data. Therefore, they are able to take a deeper look into the transaction to understand what is going on."

They can be used in firewall policies to control which traffic is allowed or denied. However, they cannot be used in Automatic NAT rules.\n\nAutomatic NAT rules are used to automatically translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses when traffic leaves the network. Security zones are not used in Automatic NAT rules because they are not needed. The firewall will automatically translate the IP addresses based on the security zone that the traffic is coming from or going to."

Check Point FireWall-1\u2019s Stateful Inspection overcomes the limitations of the previous two approaches by providing full application-layer awareness without breaking the client/server model. With Stateful Inspection, the packet is intercepted at the network layer, but then the INSPECT Engine takes over. It extracts state-related information required for the security decision from all application layers and maintains this information in dynamic state tables for evaluating subsequent connection attempts. This provides a solution which is highly secure and offers maximum performance, scalability, and extensibility."

It is a powerful protocol that can be used to collect a wide variety of information from DCs, including user accounts, computer accounts, and group memberships.\n\nAD Query uses WMI to collect information from DCs and then stores the information in a local database on the Security Gateway.
