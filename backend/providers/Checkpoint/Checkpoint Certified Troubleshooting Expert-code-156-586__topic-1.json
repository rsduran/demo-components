The debug method depends on the VPN solution (Remote Access or Mobile Access VPN). \n\n\nNOTE: The debug process is similar to the process discussed for Advanced Site-to-Site VPN. See Chapter 8 for a review.\n\nSo it is similar to the normal VPN debug method but because of the portal use it might require debugging of the HTTPD or CVPND"

The basic workflow is: 1. An identity source acquires the identity (for example, username or computer) and associated IP address and sends this information to the PDP, which resides on a Check Point machine. 2. The PDP uses relevant user sources (LDAP / RADIUS / Internal DB) and runs authorization requests and group lookups on the ID to match Access Roles. 3. The PDP sends the identify information to the enforcing Security Gateway's PEP over a SIC connection. The PEP might be on the same Gateway or a different server. 4. The PEP enforces the traffic accordingly; for example, redirecting users to Captive Portal."

Run the following command to verify the communication between the\nSecurity Gateway:\n\npdp connections idc\n\n3. Verify that the query pool and filter are defined properly and associated\nwith the Security Gateway\n\nIf necessary to investigate further, run the debug.\nIf the problem is on the Security Gateway side, debug the pdpd daemon, as\ndiscussed in this chapter."
