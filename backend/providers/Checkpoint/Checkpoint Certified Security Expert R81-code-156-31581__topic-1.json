For instance, on account of the fact that the Active Security Management Server has undergone changes since the previous synchronization (objects have been edited, or a Security Policy has been newly installed), the information on the Standby Security Management Server is lagging.\nAdvanced - the peer Security Management Server is more up-to-date.\nCollision - the Active Security Management Server and its peer have different installed Security Policies and databases. The administrator must perform manual synchronization, and decide which of the Security Management Servers to overwrite."

It also cannot be handled by the Medium Path, as the Application Control Blade requires deeper inspection than what the Medium Path can provide. Therefore, the traffic must be handled by the Slow Path.\n\nKey points to remember:\n\nSecureXL and CoreXL can significantly improve firewall performance, but they cannot accelerate all types of traffic.\nTraffic that requires deep inspection by security blades like Application Control, IPS, URL Filtering, etc., will typically be handled by the Slow Path.\nOptimizing firewall performance involves a balance between acceleration and security requirements."

This is crucial for maintaining network uptime during upgrades.\n&gt; Zero Downtime Goal: The goal of a zero downtime upgrade is to minimize service interruptions. clusterXL_admin down aligns with this goal by orchestrating a seamless failover, ensuring traffic continues to flow uninterrupted.\n\ncpstop: This command entirely stops Check Point services, which is not appropriate for a zero downtime upgrade as it would lead to service interruptions."
