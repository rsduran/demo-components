The principle involved is a simple extension of SecureXL\u2019s approach to one-time validation of a Firewall flow. The one-time validation is extended from a particular 5-attributes to a range, or block, of one or more of these attributes. This means that to accelerate the rate of new connections, connections that do not match a specified 5-attributes are still processed by SecureXL."

This path prevents a trip through all the irrelevant modules of the F2F path and directly sends packets to the Passive Streaming Layer (PSL) or the Check Point Active Streaming (CPAS) modules. The path that SecureXL uses to send packets to the PSL is called PSLXL, which is used for deeper inspection for IPS, Application Control, URL Filtering etc. In this path the gateway can do the inspection passively but cannot make changes or insert data in the stream. The path that SecureXL uses to send packets to the CPAS is called CPASXL, which is used by modules like Anti- Virus, HTTPS Inspection, VoIP, DLP etc. This module works like a transparent proxy, breaking the connection and acting as man- in- the- middle. This way it has complete control of the to connection and can make changes to the data inside the application."

As part of the Check Point SandBlast Zero-Day Protection solution, the Threat Emulation engine picks up malware at the exploit phase, even before hackers can apply evasion techniques attempting to bypass the sandbox. Files are quickly quarantined and inspected, running in a virtual sandbox to discover malicious behavior before it enters your network. This innovative solution combines CPU-level inspection and OS-level sandboxing to prevent infection from the most dangerous exploits, and zero-day and targeted attacks."
