The IP addresses can be a set of discrete IP addresses, or a subnet.\nWhen negotiating a VPN tunnel between Check Point Security Gateway and certain 3rd-party devices, IKE Quick Mode may fail, if the subnets are defined differently on each end of the VPN tunnel. One reason is that Check Point Security Gateway dynamically supernets subnets to reduce the amount of SA overhead."
