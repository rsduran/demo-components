SGM1 runs a predictive hash calculation simulating what would happen if SGM1 itself was to fail and calculates SGM3 would then get the C2S connection, so it Hypersyncs the connection info to SGM3 (BC2S).  SGM1 also runs a predictive hash calculation to determine where the return traffic will come back (S2C), and based on that Hypersyncs the connection to SGM2, who will correct the return traffic to SGM1 the connection owner for handling.  SGM2 now runs a predictive hash calculation and determines that if it fails SGM4 would get the S2C return traffic, and Hypersyncs the connection info to SGM4 (BS2C).  All 4 SGMs are consuming a connection table slot for the single NATted connection.\n\nAll of this is in the new Maestro Expert R81.10 course offered by various ATCs, and is where the \"divide connection table capacity by 4\" rule came from when dealing with NATted traffic in a Maestro Security Group.\n\nSo I would be tempted to say actually the correct answer is between 2 and 4."
