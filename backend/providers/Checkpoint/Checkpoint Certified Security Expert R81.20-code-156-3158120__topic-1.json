External services providers publish lists of IP addresses or Domains or both to allow access to their services. These lists are dynamically updated. Updatable objects derive their contents from these published lists of the providers, which Check Point uploads to the Check Point cloud. The updatable objects are updated automatically on the Security Gateway each time the provider changes a list. There is no need to install policy for the updates to take effect.
