When a Trojan horse program is run, its hidden code runs to destroy or scramble data on the hard disk. An example of a Trojan horse is a program that masquerades as a computer logon to retrieve user names and password information. The developer of a Trojan horse can use this information later to gain unauthorized access to computers. Trojan horses are normally spread by e-mail attachments. Ping sweep is a technique used to determine which of a range of IP addresses map to live hosts. It consists of ICMP<br>ECHO requests sent to multiple hosts. If a given address is live, it will return an ICMP ECHO reply. A ping is often used to check that a network device is functioning. To disable ping sweeps on a network, administrators can block ICMP ECHO requests from outside sources. However, ICMP TIMESTAMP and ICMP<br>INFO can be used in a similar manner. Spamware is software designed by or for spammers to send out automated spam e-mail. Spamware is used to search for e-mail addresses to build lists of e-mail addresses to be used either for spamming directly or to be sold to spammers. The spamware package also includes an e- mail harvesting tool. A backdoor is any program that allows a hacker to connect to a computer without going through the normal authentication process. The main advantage of this type of attack is that the network traffic moves from inside a network to the hacker's computer. The traffic moving from inside a network to the outside world is typically the least restrictive, as companies are more concerned about what comes into a network, rather than what leaves it. It, therefore, becomes hard to detect backdoors.",

    "answerDescription": "Fiber optic cable is also known as optical fiber. It is made of glass or plastic and transmits signals in the form of light. It is of cylindrical shape and consists of three concentric sections: the core, the cladding, and the jacket. Optical fiber carries much more information than conventional copper wire and is in general not subject to electromagnetic interference and the need to retransmit signals. Most telephone company's long-distance lines are now made of optical fiber. Transmission over an optical fiber cable requires repeaters at distance intervals. The glass fiber requires more protection within an outer cable than copper.<br>Answer option B is incorrect. Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors (the forward and return conductors of a single circuit) are twisted together for the purposes of canceling out electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources. It consists of the following twisted pair cables:<br>Shielded Twisted Pair: Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) is a special kind of copper telephone wiring used in some business installations. An outer covering or shield is added to the ordinary twisted pair telephone wires; the shield functions as a ground. Twisted pair is the ordinary copper wire that connects home and many business computers to the telephone company. Shielded twisted pair is often used in business installations. Unshielded Twisted Pair: Unshielded Twisted Pair<br>(UTP) is the ordinary wire used in home. UTP cable is also the most common cable used in computer networking. Ethernet, the most common data networking standard, utilizes UTP cables. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to optical fiber and coaxial cable.UTP is also finding increasing use in video applications, primarily in security cameras. Many middle to high-end cameras include a UTP output with setscrew terminals. This is made possible by the fact that UTP cable bandwidth has improved to match the baseband of television signals.<br>Answer option A is incorrect. Coaxial cable is the kind of copper cable used by cable TV companies between the community antenna and user homes and businesses. Coaxial cable is sometimes used by telephone companies from their central office to the telephone poles near users. It is also widely installed for use in business and corporation Ethernet and other types of local area network. Coaxial cable is called \"coaxial\" because it includes one physical channel that carries the signal surrounded (after a layer of insulation) by another concentric physical channel, both running along the same axis. The outer channel serves as a ground. Many of these cables or pairs of coaxial tubes can be placed in a single outer sheathing and, with repeaters, can carry information for a great distance. It is shown in the figure below:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03651/0001900001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Answer option C is incorrect. Plenum cable is cable that is laid in the plenum spaces of buildings. The plenum is the space that can facilitate air circulation for heating and air conditioning systems, by providing pathways for either heated/conditioned or return airflows. Space between the structural ceiling and the dropped ceiling or under a raised floor is typically considered plenum. However, some drop ceiling designs create a tight seal that does not allow for airflow and therefore may not be considered a plenum air-handling space. The plenum space is typically used to house the communication cables for the building's computer and telephone network.",

A low-interaction honeypot captures limited amounts of information that are mainly transactional data and some limited interactive information. Because of simple design and basic functionality, low-interaction honeypots are easy to install, deploy, maintain, and configure. A low-interaction honeypot detects unauthorized scans or unauthorized connection attempts. A low-interaction honeypot is like a one-way connection, as the honeypot provides services that are limited to listening ports. Its role is very passive and does not alter any traffic. It generates logs or alerts when incoming packets match their patterns.<br>Answer option B is incorrect. A medium-interaction honeypot offers richer interaction capabilities than a low-interaction honeypot, but does not provide any real underlying operating system target. Installing and configuring a medium-interaction honeypot takes more time than a low-interaction honeypot. It is also more complicated to deploy and maintain as compared to a low-interaction honeypot. A medium-interaction honeypot captures a greater amount of information but comes with greater risk. Answer option C is incorrect. Honeyd is an example of a low-interaction honeypot.",

    "answerDescription": "Session hijacking refers to the exploitation of a valid computer session to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system. In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server. It has particular relevance to Web developers, as the HTTP cookies used to maintain a session on many Web sites can be easily stolen by an attacker using an intermediary computer or with access to the saved cookies on the victim's computer (see HTTP cookie theft). TCP session hijacking is when a hacker takes over a TCP session between two machines. Since most authentication only occurs at the start of a TCP session, this allows the hacker to gain access to a machine.<br>Answer option A is incorrect. Spoofing is a technique that makes a transmission appear to have come from an authentic source by forging the IP address, email address, caller ID, etc. In IP spoofing, a hacker modifies packet headers by using someone else's IP address to hide his identity. However, spoofing cannot be used while surfing the Internet, chatting on-line, etc. because forging the source IP address causes the responses to be misdirected.<br>Answer option B is incorrect. Smurf is an attack that generates significant computer network traffic on a victim network. This is a type of denial-of-service attack that floods a target system via spoofed broadcast ping messages. In such attacks, a perpetrator sends a large amount of ICMP echo request (ping) traffic to IP broadcast addresses, all of which have a spoofed source IP address of the intended victim. If the routing device delivering traffic to those broadcast addresses delivers the IP broadcast to all hosts, most hosts on that IP network will take the ICMP echo request and reply to it with an echo reply, which multiplies the traffic by the number of hosts responding.<br>Answer option D is incorrect. Phishing is a type of scam that entices a user to disclose personal information such as social security number, bank account details, or credit card number. An example of phishing attack is a fraudulent e-mail that appears to come from a user's bank asking to change his online banking password. When the user clicks the link available on the e-mail, it directs him to a phishing site which replicates the original bank site. The phishing site lures the user to provide his personal information.",

IPv6 is designed to solve many of the problems that were faced by IPv4, such as address depletion, security, auto-configuration, and extensibility. With the fast increasing number of networks and the expansion of the World Wide Web, the allotted IP addresses are depleting rapidly, and the need for more network addresses is arising. IPv6 solves this problem, as it uses a 128-bit address that can produce a lot more IP addresses. These addresses are hexadecimal numbers, made up of eight octet pairs. An example of an IPv6 address is 45CF: 6D53: 12CD: AFC7: E654:<br>BB32: 543C: FACE.<br>Answer option C is incorrect. The subnet masks used in IPv6 addresses are of the same length as those used in IPv4 addresses.",

If it is combined with fwsnort and the Netfilter string match extension, it detects most of the attacks described in the Snort rule set that involve application layer data.<br>Answer option C is incorrect. NetRanger is the complete network configuration and information toolkit that includes the following tools: Ping tool, Trace Route tool,<br>Host Lookup tool, Internet time synchronizer, Whois tool, Finger Unix hosts tool, Host and port scanning tool, check multiple POP3 mail accounts tool, manage dialup connections tool, Quote of the day tool, and monitor Network Settings tool. These tools are integrated in order to use an application interface with full online help. NetRanger is designed for both new and experienced users. This tool is used to help diagnose network problems and to get information about users, hosts, and networks on the Internet or on a user computer network. NetRanger uses multi-threaded and multi-connection technologies in order to be very fast and efficient.<br>Answer option D is incorrect. Nmap is a free open-source utility for network exploration and security auditing. It is used to discover computers and services on a computer network, thus creating a \"map\" of the network. Just like many simple port scanners, Nmap is capable of discovering passive services. In addition, Nmap may be able to determine various details about the remote computers. These include operating system, device type, uptime, software product used to run a service, exact version number of that product, presence of some firewall techniques and, on a local area network, even vendor of the remote network card. Nmap runs on Linux, Microsoft Windows, etc.",

It is commonly known as Token Ring and uses a physical ring topology in which devices are connected in a closed-loop configuration. Each device on the network is connected to its adjacent neighbors, forming a physical ring. This standard specifies how data is transmitted around the ring and how devices access the network."

It is responsible for establishing a reliable end-to-end connection between applications running on different hosts and for ensuring that data is delivered error-free, in order, and without loss or duplication. It also handles flow control and congestion control to prevent network congestion and ensure efficient use of network resources. Examples of protocols at the transport layer include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n\nThe Application layer (A) provides services to user applications, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing. The Internet layer (B) is responsible for routing packets across multiple networks and provides addressing and fragmentation services. The Link layer (D) provides data link communication services between nodes on the same network segment."

Fire suppression systems are designed to detect and extinguish fires in their early stages, before they can spread and cause significant damage. These systems can use a variety of methods to suppress fires, including the use of water, foam, and chemicals, as well as the use of inert gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon, which can displace oxygen and prevent the fire from spreading. Fire suppression systems are commonly used in commercial and industrial settings, such as data centers, laboratories, and manufacturing facilities, where the risk of fire is high and the potential damage from a fire can be significant."

Usually, small-sized companies do not have an Incident Response Team (IRT). In such scenarios, first responders usually lack the confidence required to deal with an incident."

This mode is useful for protecting traffic between different networks and is primarily used for interoperability with gateways. The tunnel mode of IPsec is generally implemented in configurations such as gateway-to-gateway, server-to-gateway and server-to-server. The IPsec tunnel mode is useful in protecting traffic while it is passing through untrusted networks."

Ping sweeps are attempts to discover live hosts on a network by sending echo requests (ping) to multiple IP addresses, and they can use either TCP or UDP packets with the appropriate source and destination ports."
