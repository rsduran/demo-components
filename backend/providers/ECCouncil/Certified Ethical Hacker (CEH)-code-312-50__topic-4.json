It is often used for data compression, digital signing, encryption and decryption of messages, emails, files, and directories, and to enhance the privacy of email communications. The algorithm used for message encryption is RSA for key transport and IDEA for bulk-message encryption. PGP uses RSA for computing digital signatures and MD5 for computing message digests"

        "content": "There are two different types of sniffing: Active and Passive.  Active sniffing involves launching an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing or traffic-flooding attack against a switch in order to capture traffic.  Passive sniffing involves listening and capturing traffic but not interacting with it.  As the names indicate -- active sniffing is detectable; passive sniffing isn\u2019t. --A quick primer on the phrase shuck and jive. Erik Wemple at the Washington Post helpfully directs us to the etymological origins of the verb shuck: Since 1819, it has meant to husk corn, and more broadly to engage in \u201cthe capers associated with husking frolics,\u201d such as \u201cfooling\u201d and \u201cdeceiving.\u201d And who were the ones originally carrying out antics while shucking corn? Those would be black slaves. According to the Dictionary of American Slang.  Recommend removal of this option."
