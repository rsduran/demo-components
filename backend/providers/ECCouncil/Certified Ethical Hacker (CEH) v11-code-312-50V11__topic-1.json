By scanning fewer ports, the scan can be completed more quickly and with less network traffic, which can be useful in situations where a more comprehensive scan is not necessary or not practical due to time constraints.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that scanning fewer ports may also lead to missing some important information, especially if the target system is using non-standard ports or services. Therefore, the choice of which ports to scan should be carefully considered based on the specific needs of the scan."

TCP port 80 is used for standard HTTP traffic, which is used to access websites through their URLs. When TCP port 80 is blocked, web browsers are unable to establish the necessary HTTP connections to load web pages using URLs.\nIf the issue were a blocked DNS UDP port 53 issue, you would likely encounter problems when initially trying to resolve domain names to IP addresses using DNS. This would prevent you from even reaching the stage where you could attempt to access websites by either IP address or URL. In that case, you would experience issues with the DNS resolution process itself, before even trying to establish an HTTP connection on port 80.\nIn contrast, when you can access websites by IP address but not by URL, it's more likely that the issue lies with establishing the HTTP connection on port 80, which is used to load web pages. This points to a potential issue with blocked traffic on TCP port 80."

The protocol uses DNS tables that contain the domain name and its equivalent IP address stored in a distributed large database. In DNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, the attacker tricks a DNS server into believing that it has received authentic information when, in reality, it has not received any. The attacker tries to redirect the victim to a malicious server instead of the legitimate server. The attacker does this by manipulating the DNS table entries in the DNS. This results in substitution of a false IP address at the DNS level, where web addresses are converted into numeric IP addresses."

The attacker can then see a variety of frames forwarded from other switches to it. STP recalculation may also cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the network by causing an interruption of 30 to 45 seconds each time the root bridge changes.

It probes ACLs on packet filtering routers/firewalls using the same method as tracerouting. Firewalking involves sending TCP or UDP packets into the firewall where the TTL value is one hop greater than the targeted firewall. If the packet makes it through the gateway, the system forwards it to the next hop, where the TTL equals one, and prompts an ICMP error message at the point of rejection with a \"TTL exceeded in transi\" message. This method helps locate a firewall; additional probing facilities fingerprinting and identification of vulnerabilities.\""

The infected code runs when the system is booted from an infected disk, but once loaded it will infect other floppy disks when accessed in the infected computer. While boot sector viruses infect at a BIOS level, they use DOS commands to spread to other floppy disks. For this reason, they started to fade from the scene after the appearance of Windows 95 (which made little use of DOS instructions). Today, there are programs known as \u2018bootkits\u2019 that write their code to the primary boot record as a means of loading early in the boot process and then concealing the actions of malware running under Windows. However, they are not designed to infect removable media.\n\nThe only absolute criteria for a boot sector is that it must contain 0x55 and 0xAA as its last two bytes. If this signature is not present or is corrupted, the computer may display an error message and refuse to boot. Problems with the sector may be due to physical drive corruption or the presence of a boot sector virus."

An IoT botnet powered by Mirai malware created the DDoS attack. The Mirai malware continuously scans the Internet for vulnerable IoT devices, which are then infected and used in botnet attacks. The Mirai bot uses a short list of 62 common default usernames and passwords to scan for vulnerable devices. Because many IoT devices are unsecured or weakly secured, this short dictionary allows the bot to access hundreds of thousands of devices.\n\nAnd one of Preventive Steps was:\n- Look for suspicious traffic on port 48101. Infected devices often attempt to spread malware by using port 48101 to send results to the threat actor."

This provides a great benefit in constructing a quick worm by speeding the initial infection."

Maintaining Access:\nHacker may just hack the system to show it was vulnerable or he can be so mischievous that he wants to maintain or persist the connection in the background without the knowledge of the user. This can be done using Trojans, Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is to maintain the access to the target until he finishes the tasks he planned to accomplish in that target."

In most cases, to determine if the port is open or closed, the RST packet should be generated as a response to a probe request. However, in many BSD systems, the port is open if the packet gets dropped in response to a probe. Nmap interprets a port as open|filtered when there is no response from the Maimon scan probe even after many retransmissions. The port is closed if the probe gets a response as an RST packet. The port is filtered when the ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is returned from the target host. In Zenmap, the -sM option is used to perform the TCP Maimon scan.\nFigure 3.45: TCP Maimon scan."

If the response time is significantly different, it can indicate the success of the injected condition.\n\n    Union-based Injection: Union-based injection involves exploiting SQL queries that use the UNION SQL operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements. By injecting a crafted UNION query, the attacker can combine their own query results with the original query's results.

The objective is to deceive the resolver into associating a domain name with an incorrect IP address, thereby redirecting traffic to a malicious website or server.\n\nThe first step in a DNS cache poisoning attack is for the attacker to forge a reply from the DNS resolver. The attacker crafts a DNS response packet that appears to come from a legitimate DNS resolver, containing a fake mapping between a domain name and an IP address. The forged reply is designed to convince the target's DNS resolver to store the incorrect mapping in its cache.\n\nOnce the DNS resolver receives the forged reply, it may cache the incorrect information, associating the domain name with the attacker's desired IP address. Subsequent requests for that domain name from users within the organization will then be directed to the attacker's malicious server instead of the legitimate server.\n- ChatGPT3.5"

In this type of attack, the attacker sends a false DNS response to the user's computer or intermediate DNS server, causing it to cache the malicious data instead of the correct data. When the user later attempts to access the legitimate website, they are directed to the attacker's website instead.\n\nIf an attacker queries a nameserver using a DNS resolver, this could be part of a reconnaissance or information gathering phase of a larger attack. By querying a nameserver, the attacker can obtain information about the DNS infrastructure for a particular domain, such as the IP addresses of servers hosting the domain's website or email services. This information can be used to plan and carry out further attacks, such as DNS cache poisoning or DDoS attacks."

        "content": "STP Attack\nIn a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) attack, attackers connect a rogue switch into the network to change the operation of the STP protocol and sniff all the network traffic. STP is used in LAN-switched networks with the primary function of removing potential loops within the network. STP ensures that the traffic inside the network follows an optimized path to enhance network performance. In this process, a switch inside the network is appointed as the root bridge. After the selection of the root bridge, other switches in the network connect to it by selecting a root port (the closest port to the root bridge). The root bridge is selected with the help of Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). BPDUs each have an identification number known as a BID or ID. These BIDs consist of the Bridge Priority and the MAC address. By default, the value of the Bridge Priority is 32769. If an attacker has access to two switches, he/she introduces a rogue switch in the network with a priority lower than any other switch in the network. This makes the rogue switch the root bridge, thus allowing the attacker to sniff all the traffic flowing in the network."

This type of attack has traditionally been considered time-intensive because a new statement needed to be crafted for each bit recovered, and depending on its structure, the attack may consist of many unsuccessful requests. Recent advancements have allowed each request to recover multiple bits, with no unsuccessful requests, allowing for more consistent and efficient extraction.

Each layer provides services to the layer above and receives services from the layer below.\nThe data link layer is the second layer of the OSI model. In this layer, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits. Sniffers operate at the data link layer and can capture packets from this layer. Networking layers in the OSI model are designed to work independently of each other; thus, if a sniffer sniffs data in the data link layer, the upper OSI layers will not be aware of the sniffing."

Attackers analyze the captured traffic to perform further attacks on the target network. To sniff wireless traffic, an attacker needs to enable the monitor mode on their Wi-Fi card.\nAll Wi-Fi cards do not support the monitor mode in Windows.

It operates almost entirely passively, collecting and sorting wireless data. While it can be used for analyzing wireless packets, it is not designed for active attacks. Kismet is often associated with Linux-based systems, although versions exist for other platforms. It is used for monitoring and analyzing wireless network activity rather than actively interacting with the network.\n\nIn this context, both tshark and Kismet can be considered passive wireless packet analyzers, but tshark is more generalized for overall network traffic analysis, while Kismet is specialized for wireless network monitoring."

There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit such commands; specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript XMLHttpRequests, for example, can all work without the user's interaction or even knowledge. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.\n\nIn a CSRF attack, an innocent end user is tricked by an attacker into submitting a web request that they did not intend. This may cause actions to be performed on the website that can include inadvertent client or server data leakage, change of session state, or manipulation of an end user's account."

Often, sandboxing is useful in executing untested code or untrusted programs from unverified or untrusted third parties, suppliers, users, and websites. This enhances security by isolating the app to prevent intruders, system resources, malware such as Trojans and viruses, and other apps from interacting with it. As sandboxing isolates applications from one another, it protects them from tampering with each other; however, malicious applications may exploit vulnerabilities and bypass the sandbox.\n\nAnswer is Reverse Engineering \n\nCEHv11 Module 17 Hacking Mobile Platforms Page 2390 (Search Page 2406)"

It can be URLs, file names and hashes, domain names, IP addresses, etc. Its use ranges from blocking attacks to triaging and validating alerts and searching and eliminating specific threats within a network.\n\nIOCs usually become outdated in a matter of hours. Still, it is important to note that aging indicators aren\u2019t good practice as threats may remain active for months or even years, continuing to pose danger to enterprises. As the most volatile of the three types of intelligence, Operational indicators should be closely vetted and monitored to assure their dependability. They are better consumed by tools like SPAM filters, firewalls, IDS/IPS, SIEM, SOAR, etc, helping security teams quickly respond to malicious campaigns.\n\nOperational threat intelligence indicators are collected from active campaigns, attacks performed against honeypots and data shared by third parties.\n\nhttps://www.malwarepatrol.net/three-types-of-cyber-threat-intelligence/"

To achieve this, he encrypts the checksum of the message using asymmetric cryptography. In asymmetric cryptography, there are two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption.\nBob uses Alice's public key for encryption: Bob wants Alice to be able to decrypt and verify the checksum. In asymmetric cryptography, anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. Therefore, by encrypting the checksum with Alice's public key, only Alice (who possesses the corresponding private key) can decrypt and verify it."

It involves applying a one-way function, such as a hash function or a key derivation function, to a key multiple times in order to increase the time and resources required for an attacker to brute-force or guess the original key.\nThe idea behind key stretching is to make the key stronger by increasing its length and making it more random-looking. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to guess the original key, even if they have access to the encrypted data and the algorithm used to encrypt it."

Tactical intelligence is often used for machine-to-machine detection of threats and for incident responders to search for specific artifacts in enterprise networks.\n\nOperational threat intelligence provides insight into actor methodologies and exposes potential risks. It fuels more meaningful detection, incident response, and hunting programs. Where tactical threat intelligence gives analysts context on threats that are already known, operational intelligence brings investigations closer to uncovering completely new threats.\n\nStrategic threat intelligence provides a big picture look at how threats and attacks are changing over time. Strategic threat intelligence may be able to identify historical trends, motivations, or attributions as to who is behind an attack. Knowing the who and why of your adversaries also provides clues to their future operations and tactics. This makes strategic intelligence a solid starting point for deciding which defensive measures will be most effective."

That is they are able to sense channels/frequencies (in the air) that have vacant/available/unused/white space, and from this unused space the radios/frequencies place themselves for transmission. Why do they need to sense? This is because there may be a channel/frequency that is allocated to premium user/subscribers. Cognitive radios aims to reduce the inefficiency and lack of utilization of free/unused spaces in the channel for free users/subscribers (because no premium user/subscriber will be using the channel all the time, and also frequency band are limited)"

Here's why:\n        Script-based injection (option C): In this scenario, Jack used fraudulent emails containing malicious links. When a victim employee clicks on the link, they are directed to a fraudulent website that automatically loads Flash and triggers the exploit. The term \"script-based\" refers to the use of scripts or code embedded in a web page or email to initiate an attack. In this case, the script is used to exploit vulnerabilities in Flash and deliver the fileless malware.\n        Phishing (option D): Phishing is a broader term that encompasses various deceptive techniques to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information. In this scenario, while there is an element of deception (fraudulent emails), the specific technique used for the malware injection is script-based."

The enumerated zone information can assist the attacker in building a host network map. Organizations use DNSSEC to add security features to the DNS data and provide protection against known threats to the DNS. This security feature uses digital signatures based on public-key cryptography to strengthen authentication in DNS. These digital signatures are stored in the DNS name servers along with common records such as MX, A, AAAA, and CNAME. While DNSSEC provides Internet security, it is also susceptible to a vulnerability called zone enumeration or zone walking. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can obtain network information of a target domain, based on which they may launch Internet-based attacks. \n\nAnswer is Cache snooping"

This archival process ensures that even if a user's private key is lost or becomes inaccessible, authorized Key Recovery Agents can retrieve it from Active Directory.\n\nEscrowing Encryption Keys: Instead of storing the private key within the user's system or within Active Directory, the private key is securely stored with the designated escrow agent. This ensures that if the user loses access to their private key or encounters issues, they can request the key from the escrow agent."

Key escrow is a process of storing a copy of a cryptographic key with a trusted third party, such as a key recovery agent or an escrow server. This enables the key to be retrieved in case the original key is lost or inaccessible. In the context of BitLocker, Active Directory can act as a key escrow agent by storing a copy of the BitLocker recovery key for each encrypted device. This allows administrators to recover the keys for encrypted devices in case of key loss or device failure."

Gray hat\n\n    Explanation:\n\n        Cybercriminal (option A): A cybercriminal engages in malicious activities for personal gain or with the intent to cause harm.

John's actions do not align with the ethical behavior expected of a white hat.\n\n        Gray hat (option C): Gray hat hackers fall somewhere between white hat and black hat hackers. They may violate ethical standards, but their actions are not explicitly malicious.
