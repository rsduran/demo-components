He also found than any non-validated query that is requested can be directly communicated to the active directory and enable unauthorized users to obtain direct access to the databases. Since James knew an employee named Jason from XYZ Inc., he enters a valid username `jason` and injects `jason)(&amp;))` in the username field.

Then, the remaining layers (bottom to top) are OS, apps, data, IAM. It only makes sense to do a cloud pen test if provider owns some of the layers and you own the others as in the case of SaaS (provider owns OS &amp; apps) or PaaS (provider owns OS).\nIn the case of IaaS, you own OS, apps, data, IAM and you can't test the other layers that provider owns then launching a cloud pen-test campaign does not make sense and not economical since you can totally set up a clone of OS, apps, data, IAM on prem and pen test the heck out of it."
