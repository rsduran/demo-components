So D is the correct answer. However If we are talking about the respond from the Zombie to the attacker's machine after receiving the SYN/ACK from attacker's machine at step 3, the Zombie will send the RST to attacker's machine and increase the IPID by 1 since step 2 (IPID = 31401 + 1 = 31402) so in this case B is the correct answer).

What if you are sending another packet to the zombie? Please, note that questing says something about an IDLE scan, but does not say anything about the kind of packet you sent to the zombie. Why not, an HTTP SYN request? Lets suppose this last case...\n\nThat case, you will send a SYN, IPID 31400, and zombie will answer SYNACK, 31401 and send its own IPID sequence, randomly generated.

A remote user accessing: http://router.address/level/$NUMBER/exec/.... (where $NUMBER is a number in the range of 16 to 99) bypasses all authentication checking. This leads to a remote user gaining a privilege level of 15, which in IOS software is full administrative access (also known as enable). With administrative access, remote attackers may be able to further compromise the network. They may be able to, for example: divert/redirect traffic, possibly monitor traffic, and/or cause a denial of service"

Polymorphic malware works by encrypting itself with a variable encryption key since the keys used for encryption are different so each copy looks different. But the virus decryption routine would remain constant and because of this static part of code, it gets easy for an antivirus program to identify the malware."

Dictionary attacks work because many computer users and businesses insist on using ordinary words as passwords. Dictionary attacks are rarely successful against systems that employ multiple-word phrases, and unsuccessful against systems that employ random combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters mixed up with numerals. In those systems, the brute-force method of attack (in which every possible combination of characters and spaces is tried up to a certain maximum length) can sometimes be effective, although this approach can take a long time to produce results."
