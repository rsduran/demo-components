It employs electromagnetic induction to enable communication between devices connected within a range of 10 cm. The NFC chip embedded within a mobile device can read RFID tags and also be used to establish Bluetooth connections with nearby devices to exchange information such as images and contact lists. Although it allows a very narrow communication range, an attacker with a specialized antenna can intercept and capture the data by jamming the traffic. This security issue may result from the improper configuration of NFC and non-encrypted data transmission. An attacker may craft and send malicious RFID tags, forcing the mobile user to visit a fake website in the browser. Furthermore, an attacker may perform a DoS attack by creating enormous RF signals to corrupt the NFC data being transmitted in that area."
