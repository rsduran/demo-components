For example, an attacker might request an authorized person to unlock a security door, saying that they have forgotten their ID badge. In the interest of common courtesy, the authorized person will allow the attacker to pass through the door.\n\nTailgating \nTailgating implies accessing a building or secured area without the consent of the authorized\nperson. It is the act of following an authorized person through a secure entrance, as a polite user would open and hold the door for those following them. An attacker, wearing a fake badge, might attempt to enter the secured area by closely following an authorized person through a door that requires key access. They then try to enter the restricted area while pretending to be an authorized person"

Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all operating systems, SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and receive responses independent of language and platforms."

It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls. It is also relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never completes TCP connections. SYN scan works against any compliant TCP stack rather than depending on idiosyncrasies of specific platforms as Nmap's FIN/NULL/Xmas, Maimon and idle scans do. It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between the open, closed, and filtered states."

Moreover, choosing the appropriate values can sometimes take more time than the scan you are trying to optimize. So Nmap offers a simpler approach, with six timing templates. You can specify them with the -T option and their number (0\u20135) or their name. The template names are paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5). The first two are for IDS evasion. Polite mode slows down the scan to use less bandwidth and target machine resources. Normal mode is the default and so -T3 does nothing. Aggressive mode speeds scans up by making the assumption that you are on a reasonably fast and reliable network. Finally insane mode assumes that you are on an extraordinarily fast network or are willing to sacrifice some accuracy for speed.\n\n-O operating system"

In some cases, error-based SQL injection alone is enough for an attacker to enumerate an entire database. While errors are very useful during the development phase of a web application, they should be disabled on a live site, or logged to a file with restricted access instead.\n\nUnion-based SQLi\nUnion-based SQLi is an in-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result which is then returned as part of the HTTP response."

Attackers exploit injection flaws by constructing malicious commands or queries that result in data loss or corruption, lack of accountability, or denial of access. Injection flaws are prevalent in legacy code, often found in SQL, LDAP, and XPath queries, etc. and can be easily discovered by application vulnerability scanners and fuzzers. Attackers inject malicious code, commands, or scripts in the input gates of flawed web applications in such a way that the applications interpret and run with the newly supplied malicious input, which in turn allows them to extract sensitive information. By exploiting injection flaws in web applications, attackers can easily read, write, delete, and update any data (i.e., relevant or irrelevant to that particular application).\""

It also has the ability to verify that a domain name does not exist at all, which can help prevent man in the middle attacks.\n\nDNSSEC will verify the root domain or sometimes called \u201csigning the root.\u201d When an end user attempts to access a site, a stub resolver on their computer requests the site's IP address from a recursive name server. After the record is requested by the server, it will also request the zones DNSEC key. The key will then be used to verify that the IP address record is the same as the record on the authoritative server."

Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards were developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods.\n\nA new salt is randomly generated for each password. In a typical setting, the salt and the password (or its version after key stretching) are concatenated and processed with a cryptographic hash function, and the output hash value (but not the original password) is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows for later authentication without keeping and therefore risking exposure of the plaintext password in the event that the authentication data store is compromised."

The gateway is not routing to a public IP address.\n\nExplanation:\nThe role of the gateway in a local network is to serve as an access point to another network, typically the Internet. If a device can communicate with others on the local network but not with the Internet, it's possible that the gateway isn't properly routing traffic to the Internet. The fact that the computer and gateway are on the same subnet (192.168.1.0/24) confirms that they can communicate with each other, so the issue is likely with the gateway's connection or routing to the public network."

However, the computer is unable to reach the Internet while still being able to transfer files locally. This suggests that the issue lies in the network configuration.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that the gateway configured on the computer is not the correct one for accessing the Internet. The gateway should be the IP address of the device that provides access to networks outside of the local network (in this case, the Internet). Since the computer can communicate with other machines on the local network, it indicates that the local network is functioning properly.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the technician should verify the correct IP address of the gateway device that provides Internet connectivity and update the computer's network configuration accordingly."

TCP port 80 is the default port used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is the protocol used for web browsing. When you try to access websites using the URL (e.g., \"http://www.example.com\"), your browser communicates with the web server over TCP port 80 to retrieve the web pages.\n\nGiven that you can ping the servers and access them using their IP addresses, it indicates that the servers are reachable and responsive. However, the fact that you cannot access the websites using their URLs suggests that there may be an issue with the traffic on TCP port 80, which is used for regular web browsing."

(Protocol no:50)\n\nAH provides authentication, integrity and anti-replay services at Network Layer and above.\nESP provides authentication, integrity, anti-replay and confidentiality services at Transport Layer and above.\nHence, we can say, IPSec(AH+ESP) operates at Network Layer and provide security services at Network and above layers.\n\nA note on IKE protocol\nIts imperative that, if two entities want to communicate securely, they should share secret keys to set up a secure connection, encrypt and decrypt messages etc. Hence, Apart from AH and ESP , most of the IPSec implementations also use a Key exchange and management protocol that generates, negotiates and manages secret keys for establishing a secure channel between communicating entities. This key exchange protocol is called IKE - Internet Key exchange protocol."

        "content": "Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to determine what layer 4 protocols a given IP forwarding device will pass. Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will see no response.\n\nTo get the correct IP TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the gateway we need to ramp up hop-counts. We do this in the same manner that traceroute works. Once we have the gateway hopcount (at that point the scan is said to be `bound`) we can begin our scan.\n\nIt is significant to note the fact that the ultimate destination host does not have to be reached. It just needs to be somewhere downstream, on the other side of the gateway, from the scanning host."

This can be accomplished by simply storing an IMG or IFRAME tag in a field that accepts HTML, or by a more complex cross-site scripting attack. If the attack can store a CSRF attack in the site, the severity of the attack is amplified. In particular, the likelihood is increased because the victim is more likely to view the page containing the attack than some random page on the Internet. The likelihood is also increased because the victim is sure to be authenticated to the site already."

Network administrators may only be interested in hosts running a certain service, while security auditors may care about every single device with an IP address. An administrator may be comfortable using just an ICMP ping to locate hosts on his internal network, while an external penetration tester may use a diverse set of dozens of probes in an attempt to evade firewall restrictions."

By default, Nmap only performs heavy probing such as port scans, version detection, or OS detection against hosts that are found to be up. Disabling host discovery with -Pn causes Nmap to attempt the requested scanning functions against every target IP address specified. So if a class B target address space (/16) is specified on the command line, all 65,536 IP addresses are scanned. Proper host discovery is skipped as with the list scan, but instead of stopping and printing the target list, Nmap continues to perform requested functions as if each target IP is active. To skip ping scan and port scan, while still allowing NSE to run, use the two options -Pn -sn together."

This evasion technique is based on splitting an attack vector between multiple instances of a parameter with the same name. Since none of the relevant HTTP RFCs define the semantics of HTTP parameter manipulation, each web application delivery platform may deal with it differently. In particular, some environments process such requests by concatenating the values taken from all instances of a parameter name within the request. This behavior is abused by the attacker in order to bypass pattern-based security mechanisms."

This can mean transforming your shellcode into pure alphanumeric, getting rid of bad characters or encoding it for 64 bit target.\n\nIt can also be instructed to encode shellcode multiple times, output the shellcode in numerous formats (C, Perl, Ruby) and one can even merge it to an existing executable file.

At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.\nEncode data on output. At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.\nUse appropriate response headers. To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend.\nContent Security Policy. As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur."

Both Bluesnarfing and Bluejacking exploit others' Bluetooth connections without their knowledge. While Bluejacking is essentially harmless as it only transmits data to the target device, Bluesnarfing is the theft of information from the target device.[citation needed]"

It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.\n\nNikto is not designed as a stealthy tool. It will test a web server in the quickest time possible, and is obvious in log files or to an IPS/IDS. However, there is support for LibWhisker's anti-IDS methods in case you want to give it a try (or test your IDS system)."
