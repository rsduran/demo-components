Scenario testing\n\nScenario testing works by creating a simulated disaster scenario, such as a fire, to test how well the procedures for handling such incidents work in practice. By simulating these scenarios, organizations can assess the effectiveness of their incident response plans and identify any weaknesses or areas that need improvement. This type of testing helps ensure that the organization is prepared to deal with real-life emergencies and can minimize the impact of any potential disasters."
