This is chosen cypher text attack beacuse attacker can choose arbitary encrypted text and decrypt it. Observing output and comparing this to input samples he can deduct the encryption key.  Chosen-plaintext attack is an opposite attack to chosen-cypher text attack. in Chosen-cypher text attack attacker chooses  samples of plaintext, encrypt it and compares output with inputs to deduct encryption key. \n\nQuestion in exam is a bit stupid. Normally doing sniffing is rather unlikely that attacker can decrypt payload and still be looking for encryption key that is often specyfic to session."

When the receiver gets the message, they can verify its authenticity by using the sender's public key to decrypt the digital signature and comparing it to the message digest they calculated from the received message.
