You need 5 for password to be accepted.\nProduct123. - product will get 1 point as it is in Custom Banned Password list + 1 point for each character in 123 + 1 point for \".\" = 5 points.\nSo I will say that the password for User3 might be accepted but as we don't have the option for \"User1 and User2 only\", I suppose that \"123\" is a combination included in Microsoft Banned Password list and if it so - this fact sucks as nobody knows what it contains, you have to test it because you won't find it in any documentation."

It performs a thorough check of passwords against a list of banned words and common patterns to improve password security.\n\nIn this case, the passwords \"C0nt0s0\", \"F@brikamHQ\", and \"Pr0duct123\" contain variations of prohibited words in the custom list, such as \"Contoso\", \"Fabrikam\", and \"Product\", and are therefore considered insecure by Azure AD password protection. The tool is sensitive to substitutions of letters for numbers, special characters and other variations, as these practices still result in predictable and insecure passwords."
