The data supports analytics workloads that have unpredictable and variable data access patterns.<br><br>The company does not access some data for months. However, the company must be able to retrieve all data within milliseconds. The company needs to optimize S3 storage costs.<br><br>Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
