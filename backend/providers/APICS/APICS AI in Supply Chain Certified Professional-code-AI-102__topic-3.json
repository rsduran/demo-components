Language\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr\nOCR or Optical Character Recognition is also referred to as text recognition or text extraction. Machine-learning based OCR techniques allow you to extract printed or handwritten text from images, such as posters, street signs and product labels, as well as from documents like articles, reports, forms, and invoices. The text is typically extracted as words, text lines, and paragraphs or text blocks, enabling access to digital version of the scanned text. This eliminates or significantly reduces the need for manual data entry."

Azure Form Recognizer is designed to extract key-value pairs, tables, and text from documents, including PDFs. It supports various document types, making it suitable for extracting text from press releases in PDF format.\n\nFor sentiment analysis, you can use the Azure Text Analytics service. Azure Text Analytics includes a sentiment analysis feature that can analyze the sentiment of text documents and provide a sentiment score. This service can help you determine whether the sentiment expressed in the press releases is positive, negative, or neutral."

The Azure Cognitive Search blob indexer can extract text from PDF and other document formats 2. However, extracting text from embedded images or tables is not yet integrated in Azure Search, but it is on the roadmap 3.\n\nTo extract text from PDF files using Azure Cognitive Search, you can use the Document Extraction cognitive skill 1. This skill extracts content from a file within the enrichment pipeline and can extract text and images with high accuracy 1. You can use this skill to extract text from PDF files and perform sentiment analysis on the extracted text using the Sentiment Analysis feature provided by Azure Cognitive Services."
