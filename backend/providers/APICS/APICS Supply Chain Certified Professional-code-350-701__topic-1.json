It allows for granular control and isolation of communication between applications or containers within the same node or network. By implementing microsegmentation, organizations can enforce strict access controls and policies, ensuring that communication is restricted only to the necessary and authorized endpoints."

Microsegmentation\n\nMicrosegmentation is the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller segments, or microsegments, in order to limit communication between applications or containers on the same node. This approach uses network security policies to define what traffic is allowed to flow between different microsegments, which helps to reduce the attack surface and minimize the impact of a security breach. Microsegmentation is often used in conjunction with other security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems to provide a more comprehensive security strategy."
