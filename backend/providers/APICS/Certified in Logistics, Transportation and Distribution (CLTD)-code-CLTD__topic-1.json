It is critical that both of these climatic conditions are optimized at a relative measure to keep inventory in good condition.\n\nWhether it is the scorching heat of the Western states or the biting cold of Alaska, the indoor temperature and humidity of the warehouse must be maintained at optimum levels.\n\nWhy? When outdoor temperature levels increase, so does humidity and vice-versa, which might be unfavorable for many products, especially agricultural produce and perishable goods. Too much humidity can spoil temperature-sensitive goods like medicines which require cold storage conditions, often in sub-zero temperature without humidity. Climate-controlled warehouses come with dehumidifiers that maintain temperature and humidity levels at optimum levels. Dehumidifiers also help you keep mold, dust mites, mildew, etc. from growing on your goods."

In this situation, the risks should be accepted and carefully monitored.\nLimit: The most common mitigation strategy is risk limitation, i.e. businesses take some type of action to address a perceived risk and regulate their exposure. Risk limitation usually employs some risk acceptance and some risk avoidance."

Current assets include inventory, accounts receivable, and cash. Current liabilities include accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nIf inventory is too high, it will increase the value of current assets, but it will not increase net working capital. This is because inventory is a current asset, but it is also a current liability. When inventory is sold, it is converted into accounts receivable, which is another current asset. However, when accounts receivable are collected, the cash is used to pay off accounts payable, which is a current liability.\n\nTherefore, if inventory is too high, it will not increase net working capital. In fact, it may actually decrease net working capital if the inventory is not selling quickly enough."

However, the customer service level will be higher, since there will be more warehouses nearer the customer (thus faster reaction time) and greater likelihood of being able to satisfy required customer demand within an acceptable time. Fewer warehouses means lower costs in general but also less competitiveness in terms of the ability to provide service quickly and with minimum risk. Businesses must consider their customers, their business models, and their costs in making this decision."

While product demand and cubic dimension are indeed important factors in slotting criteria, customer segmentation is also a crucial consideration. Customer segmentation involves categorizing customers based on factors such as purchasing behavior, preferences, and needs. By grouping inventory in a way that aligns with different customer segments, firms can optimize their warehouse operations to better meet the specific requirements of each segment. This can include considerations such as proximity to shipping areas, grouping related products together for easier access, or ensuring that high-value items are stored securely. Therefore, customer segmentation is an important slotting criterion alongside product demand and cubic dimension."

Each worker is responsible for picking all items within their assigned zone for each order. This reduces the distance each worker has to travel because they stay within their zone.\n3.

Life cycle support.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLife cycle support is the process in the supply chain that involves the assessment of repair and support of products. This process is concerned with the entire life span of a product, from its creation to its disposal, including the stages of production, distribution, use, and maintenance.\n\nWhile product/service development launch does involve the creation and implementation of support services for a product, it is primarily focused on the initial stages of a product's life cycle, such as design, development, and launch. It does not typically include the ongoing assessment of repair and support needs throughout the product's life cycle."
