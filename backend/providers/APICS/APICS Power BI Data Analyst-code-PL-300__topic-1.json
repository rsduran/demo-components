Does this question keep coming back to test us with a different answer scenario...? For example, #10 D said \"Apply a transformation to extract...\" but #30 has the same A, B and C answers as #10, but #30 D is different; \"Apply the Parse function...\", not \"transformation.\" Then #27 B and C answers are the same answers as #10 C, D and #30 C, D, and #27 A is the same answer as #30 D (Parse), but #27 D uses a new answer (\"Create a column by...\"), which is not appeared in #10 and #30."
