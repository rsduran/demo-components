To check the internet bandwidth of the local offices, they first have to test using the Network Testing Companion the actual real-time bandwidth available and other metrics like latency, jitter, packet loss. If these metrics show subpar numbers, then the company will first have to upgrade the internet connectivity infrastructure and then roll-out MS Teams. They can start rolling out the Teams platform starting from the Main office and in a staggered manner to the local offices. In the meantime, the Islands option will help keep the Main and Local offices connected."

This auto attendant will play the appropriate greeting and route calls accordingly.\nOutside Office Hours, Weekends, and Holidays Greeting: For the remaining scenarios (outside office hours, weekends, and national holidays), you can set up a second auto attendant. This way, you\u2019ll have a total of two unique greetings\u2014one for office hours and another for non-office hours.\nRemember that auto attendants allow callers to navigate a menu system and direct their calls to the right department, person, or other destinations within your organization1. Additionally, each auto attendant can have up to 15 authorized users2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 2 auto attendants."

If you want to be available specific for a user then you need to use a app permission policy\n\n\"\nBy default, all users in your organization can access the app in your organization's app store. To restrict and control who has permission to use the app, you can create and assign an app permission policy.

App permission policies control the permissions and capabilities granted to apps, ensuring proper security and privacy. On the other hand, App setup policies focus on the availability and behavior of apps, allowing administrators to manage the app experience for users."
