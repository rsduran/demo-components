By configuring the server-level firewall rule to only allow access from the IP addresses within the Litware on-premises network, you can effectively block access from users outside the network.\n\nOptions A and B, virtual network rules, are not the most appropriate choices in this case because they apply to the network level rather than the server or database level.
