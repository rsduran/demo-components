They are a key component of voice routing policies and help in determining the routing of outbound calls based on the user's location or other criteria.\n- **Voice Routing Policies (D)**:\n    - **Voice routing policies** determine how calls are routed from Microsoft Teams to the PSTN. These policies include PSTN usages and ensure that calls are directed to the appropriate SBCs based on the defined rules. For redundancy, voice routing policies should include multiple SBCs to ensure that if one fails, calls can still be routed through another.\n- **Highly Available Session Border Controllers (SBCs) (E)**:\n    - **Highly available SBCs** are critical for redundancy. By deploying redundant SBCs, you ensure that if one SBC fails, the other can take over, allowing outbound calls to continue without interruption."

From the Microsoft Call Quality Dashboard select Tenant Data Upload and upload a CSV file that contains all the network sites.\n\nExplanation:\nMicrosoft Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) uses uploaded network data to accurately report and analyze call quality based on network locations.\nTenant Data Upload is used to upload a CSV file that contains details about your network topology, including sites, subnets, and building information.\nFor the new site to appear in location-based reports, you need to upload a CSV file that includes all network sites. This ensures that the dashboard has a complete view of your network topology.\nUploading a CSV with all sites ensures that any missing data is corrected and all sites are correctly represented in the reports.\nOption E (uploading a CSV file with the new network site only) might not update all necessary details in the CQD, leading to incomplete data. Therefore, uploading all network sites is the more comprehensive solution."
