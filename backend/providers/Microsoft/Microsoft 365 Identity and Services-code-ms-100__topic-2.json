Therefore the other 45 users have the correct UPN suffix. This tells us that the adatum.com domain has already been added to Office 365 as a custom domain.The forest is named adatum.local and uses adatum.com as a UPN suffix. User accounts in the domain will have adatum.local as their default UPN suffix. To use adatum.com as the UPN suffix, each user account will need to be configured to use adatum.com as the UPN suffix. Any synchronized user account that has adatum.local as a UPN suffix will be configured to use a UPN suffix of onmicrosoft.com because adatum.local cannot be added to Office 365 as a custom domain. Therefore, the reason that the five synchronized users have usernames with a UPN suffix of onmicrosoft.com is because their accounts were not configured to use the UPN suffix of contoso.com."

You can educate your users about DLP policies and help them remain compliant without blocking their work. For example, if a user tries to share a document containing sensitive information, a DLP policy can both send them an email notification and show them a policy tip in the context of the document library that allows them to override the policy if they have a business justification. The same policy tips also appear in Outlook on the web, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.\nIf you find that users are incorrectly marking content as false positive and bypassing the DLP policy, you can configure the policy to not allow user overrides.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/data-loss-prevention-policies"

Here's why.\n\nIn SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, the search index is built up by crawling the content on your sites. The crawler picks up content and metadata from the documents in the form of crawled properties. The search schema helps the crawler decide what content and metadata to pick up. Examples of metadata are the author and the title of a document. However, to get the content and metadata from the documents into the search index, the crawled properties must be mapped to managed properties. Only managed properties are kept in the index. For example, a crawled property related to author is mapped to a managed property related to author.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/protect-documents-that-have-fci-or-other-properties?view=o365-worldwide"

Using Windows provisioning, an IT administrator can easily specify desired configuration and settings required to enroll the devices into management and then apply that configuration to target devices in a matter of minutes. It is best suited for small- to medium-sized businesses with deployments that range from tens to a few hundred computers.\n\nA provisioning package (.ppkg) is a container for a collection of configuration settings. With Windows 10, you can create provisioning packages that let you quickly and efficiently configure a device without having to install a new image.\n\nProvisioning packages are simple enough that with a short set of written instructions, a student or non-technical employee can use them to configure their device. This can result in a significant reduction in the time required to configure multiple devices in your organization."

This method is suitable for smaller organizations like yours, with fewer than 2,000 mailboxes to migrate. With a cutover migration, all mailboxes, email, contacts, and calendar items are moved from Outlook.com to Microsoft 365 in a single step.\n\nTo perform a cutover migration, you need to have administrative access to the Outlook.com account and the Microsoft 365 account. You'll need to create user accounts in Microsoft 365, assign licenses, and set up email forwarding to ensure no emails are lost during the migration process.\n\nOverall, a cutover migration is a quick and simple way to migrate mailboxes to Microsoft 365 for small businesses. However, it may not be suitable for larger organizations with more complex email systems or those that require a longer transition period."

This is because the on-premises Active Directory user object for User2 does not have a matching user principal name in Azure AD.\n\nTo allow User2 to access the resources in Azure AD, you need to ensure that the on-premises Active Directory user object for User2 is synchronized to Azure AD and that the user object has a matching user principal name in Azure AD. You can do this by configuring Azure AD Connect to synchronize the user principal name attribute from Active Directory to Azure AD.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is to synchronize the on-premises Active Directory user object for User2 to Azure AD and ensure that the user object has a matching user principal name in Azure AD.

Same user permissions on the files, same permission preservation on the files in SPMT, and same User Mapping file. \n\nThe answers are:\nUserA is the owner: Yes\nUserB is the owner: No\nGroupA is the owner: Yes\n\nIt looks like it really comes down to that Full Control perm on the file share.

This will allow Microsoft 365 to obtain device and software metrics, which are required for the Productivity Score. Endpoint analytics enables the collection of information about the devices and applications used by users in your organization. This information is used to provide insights into the productivity and effectiveness of your organization, and can help you identify areas for improvement."
