This is not acceptable.\nOption2\n\nWe can preemptively set the virtual machine network adapters to a virtual switch with the same name as the one on the target and enable VLAN ID. Consequently, this means you have to create those and need NICs to do so\""

Each question presents a different goal and answer choices, but the text of the scenario is exactly the same in each question in this series.<br>A company named Contoso, Ltd. has several servers that run Windows Server 2016. Contoso has a Hyper-V environment that uses failover clustering and<br>Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). The environment contains several Windows containers and several virtual machines.<br>The WSUS deployment contains one upstream server that is located on the company's perimeter network and several downstream servers located on the internal network. A firewall separates the upstream server from the downstream servers.<br>You plan to deploy a human resources application to a new server named HRServer5. HRServer5 contains a FAT32-formatted data volume.<br>The CIO of Contoso identifies the following requirements for the company's IT department:<br>- Deploy a failover cluster to two new virtual machines.<br>- Store all application databases by using Encrypted File System (EFS).<br>- Ensure that each Windows container has a dedicated IP address assigned by a DHCP server.<br>- Produce a report that lists the processor time used by all of the processes on a server named Server1 for five hours.<br>- Encrypt all communication between the internal network and the perimeter network, including all WSUS communications.<br>- Automatically load balance the virtual machines hosted in the Hyper-V cluster when processor utilization exceeds 70 percent.<br>You need to create a Data Collector Set to meet the requirement for the processor time report.<br>What command should you run to create the Data Collector Set?

        "content": "I think C and E correct.\nWhen you configure QoS for a tenant VM network adapter, you have a choice between Data Center Bridging (DCB)or Software Defined Networking (SDN) QoS.\n\nDCB. You can configure DCB by using the Windows PowerShell NetQoS cmdlets. For an example, see the section \"Enable Data Center Bridging\" in the topic Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and Switch Embedded Teaming (SET).\n\nSDN QoS. You can enable SDN QoS by using Network Controller, which can be set to limit bandwidth on a virtual interface to prevent a high-traffic VM from blocking other users. You can also configure SDN QoS to reserve a specific amount of bandwidth for a VM to ensure that the VM is accessible regardless of the amount of network traffic.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/sdn/manage/configure-qos-for-tenant-vm-network-adapter"

It shows that after modifying security permissions, they have enabled inheritance. In this situation, when you press OK, it will inherit all security permission from the parent folder. Default permission on every shared folder is Read &amp; Execute for Users/Domain Users. So the User3 is inheriting Read &amp; Execute permission from Share1 and Write permission from File1.txt. The result is that he can see and modify the file.\nConfirmed in the lab environment."

It is an emulated device, meaning that Hyper-V creates a complete digital reconstruction of a common, basic physical network adapter. This adapter type exists for those situations in which there is no way for a particular guest to load the standard Hyper-V network adapter. In most cases, this is for PXE booting Generation 1 virtual machines. Any other cases would involve unsupported operating systems that have no driver for the standard virtual adapter. This adapter is locked at about 100Mbps speed and requires a comparatively high amount of CPU processing, so avoid using it in situations that do not strictly require it.\n[Synthetic] Network Adapter: Usually only named as a \u201cNetwork Adapter\u201d, Hyper-V\u2019s synthetic network adapter is a connection between Hyper-V\u2019s VMBus or an IOV Virtual Function and the virtual machine or management operating system. It is substantially faster than the legacy network adapter.\n\n\nIets using a VHD (so older volume), so if its gen1 VM --&gt; legacy nic"

As stated in your link 'NIC Teaming in Windows Server 2016 supports teams with two members in VMs. You can create larger teams, but there is no support for larger teams'. So the team will never understand the extra NICs. But by using the HyperV manager to enable NIC teaming on the VM under the Advanced Features of the NIC, it clearly states at that option: 'When this option is cleared, a team created in the guest operating system will lose connectivity if one of the physical network adapters stops working.' By default, this option is cleared, so the answer A actually tells you to set the option! So A IS the correct answer."

You also create the switch in the process of enabling it on Server1, as you can only enable it when you create a new switch.\nTCP offload is discouraged by MS.

NAT even applies on the localhost (Server 1) that is hosting the Container. For Server 2 it is easy, NAT again. For Container 2 it is connected to the same internal vSwitch that is part of the default NAT. The internal switch allows internal communication between the hosts, so it can be accessed by 172.16.1.100:8080. It is an internal switch ONLY so it can't see anything outside.

If we were to attempt a Live Migration from Hyper-V manager of VM1 from a host in FC1 to a host in FC3, then it would fail because of the diferent CPUs. Unless we were able to enable processor compatability a Live Migration is not a valid option. Therefore only Export and import is left as the valid choice.\n\nThe only other possability that could be, would be doing a shared nothing migration.

The Get-ClusterLog cmdlet not only grabs the Cluster logs off every node, and gives you the ability to dictate where to save them and for what period of time, but also, by default, also grabs the System and other log channels! The only thing that failed in that node is the service in question.

It's testing you on the knowledge of a Microsoft Product: Microsoft Server 2016. Yes, you can first take a look at the System log and check out what happened there, maybe.

Egress traffic is tagged, but due to the lack of trunking the ingress traffic is not tagged (the tag is removed when a packet is delivered to endpoint on the switchport). So packets leaving VM1 are tagged with VLAN2 by switch1, and all switchports connected to switch1 and in VLAN2 receive the packet. This means only VM4 will receive the packet, and is also able to respond due to it's VLAN2 membership. Switch3 is internal and is therefore not connected to switch1. \nVM2 packets are untagged, and are presented to switchports that either are untagged as well, or have a VLAN ID but do not block untagged traffic. In the latter case, the endpoint will receive the packet, but is unable to respond as it's egress traffic is tagged due to it's VLAN membership, and the untagged endpoint never receive this response packet.

Each question presents a different goal and answer choices, but the text of the scenario is exactly the same in each question in this series.<br>A company named Contoso, Ltd. has several servers that run Windows Server 2016. Contoso has a Hyper-V environment that uses failover clustering and<br>Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). The environment contains several Windows containers and several virtual machines.<br>The WSUS deployment contains one upstream server that is located on the company's perimeter network and several downstream servers located on the internal network. A firewall separates the upstream server from the downstream servers.<br>You plan to deploy a human resources application to a new server named HRServer5. HRServer5 contains a FAT32-formatted data volume.<br>The CIO of Contoso identifies the following requirements for the company's IT department:<br>\u2711 Deploy a failover cluster to two new virtual machines.<br>\u2711 Store all application databases by using Encrypted File System (EFS).<br>\u2711 Ensure that each Windows container has a dedicated IP address assigned by a DHCP server.<br>\u2711 Produce a report that lists the processor time used by all of the processes on a server named Server1 for five hours.Encrypt all communication between the internal network and the perimeter network, including all WSUS communications.<br>\u2711 Automatically load balance the virtual machines hosted in the Hyper-V cluster when processor utilization exceeds 70 percent.<br>You need to configure the storage solution for the planned failover cluster.<br>You create two new generations 2 virtual machines on two separate Hyper-V hosts named VM11 and VM12.<br>Which three actions should you perform in sequence next?

Contoso has a Hyper-V environment that uses failover clustering and<br>Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). The environment contains several Windows containers and several virtual machines.<br>The WSUS deployment contains one upstream server that is located on the company's perimeter network and several downstream servers located on the internal network. A firewall separates the upstream server from the downstream servers.<br>You plan to deploy a human resources application to a new server named HRServer5. HRServer5 contains a FAT32-formatted data volume.<br>The CIO of Contoso identifies the following requirements for the company's IT department:<br>\u2711 Deploy a failover cluster to two new virtual machines.<br>\u2711 Store all application databases by using Encrypted File System (EFS).<br>\u2711 Ensure that each Windows container has a dedicated IP address assigned by a DHCP server.<br>\u2711 Produce a report that lists the processor time used by all of the processes on a server named Server1 for five hours.<br>\u2711 Encrypt all communication between the internal network and the perimeter network, including all WSUS communications.<br>\u2711 Automatically load balance the virtual machines hosted in the Hyper-V cluster when processor utilization exceeds 70 percent.<br>Which two actions should you perform to meet the encryption requirement for WSUS?

The child needs to reach up to the parent and pull in users or groups from the parent to assign rights. The same process happens in reverse parent needs to pull in users or group from the child to assign rights. My question there are no rights established between the two domains.
