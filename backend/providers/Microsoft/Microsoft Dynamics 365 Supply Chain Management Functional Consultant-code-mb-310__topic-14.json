However, I have not discussed a great feature called fixed asset determination rules.  These rules combine the functionality of procurement and sourcing, product information management and fixed assets to allow users to automatically create fixed assets from purchase orders when selecting a procurement category.  The determination rules take the guess work out of the users hands to ensure that these assets are properly recorded in your system\n\n\nhttps://www.loganconsulting.com/blog/fixed-asset-determination-rules-in-d365-for-finance-and-operations/"
