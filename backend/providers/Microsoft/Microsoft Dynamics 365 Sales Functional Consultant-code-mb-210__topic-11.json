If you have an opportunity for multiple products to be sold over different countries you must have multiple price lists one for each country. Then it is healthy to have one quote for each country so you can associate the quote with the relative price list of that country. I don't see how you can achieve this with one single quote for a single opportunity."

Either way, the quote is coming off of the opp"

It is better to create for different countries, so that we can help the business flow.\nFor 2, it is B, because the price / discotinued product will not update until you make changes of the quote.\nFor 3, it is A because it needs for Canadian plant, it suppose to use the price list of Canada. The step should be \"Revise\" quote, change the currency, then change the price list, delete the old product item. By changing the currency itself, cannot help the whole process. So I would say A is more suitable for the whole process."
