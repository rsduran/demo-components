Data storage costs must be minimized.<br>General-purpose v2 accounts: Basic storage account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>\u2711 BlockBlobStorage accounts: Storage accounts with premium performance characteristics for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for scenarios with high transactions rates, or scenarios that use smaller objects or require consistently low storage latency.<br>\u2711 General-purpose v1 accounts: Legacy account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Use general-purpose v2 accounts instead when possible.<br>Replication: Geo-redundant Storage<br>Scenario: Data must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones.<br>Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS.

GZRS because \"Data must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones.\" and are not required for reading access in the secondary region. Due to GZRS is cheaper than RA-GZRS, we select it.\n3. There are no specific requirements that lead us to which access tier is better. Cool has an advantage when we care about storage cost and we do not change files. We store SPA. It is not supposed to be huge. But due to we expect that the modern development process may be turned into multiple releases per day, I believe that hot is preferable. And again, because we do not have specific requirements and default is used to be \"hot\", I select \"hot\":"
