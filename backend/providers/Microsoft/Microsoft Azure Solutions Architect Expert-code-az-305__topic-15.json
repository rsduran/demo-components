    "answerDescription": "Box 1: SQL Managed Instance -<br>Scenario: Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:<br>\u2711 Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.<br>\u2711 Fail over automatically.<br>\u2711 Minimize I/O latency.<br>The auto-failover groups feature allows you to manage the replication and failover of a group of databases on a server or all databases in a managed instance to another region. It is a declarative abstraction on top of the existing active geo-replication feature, designed to simplify deployment and management of geo- replicated databases at scale. You can initiate a geo-failover manually or you can delegate it to the Azure service based on a user-defined policy. The latter option allows you to automatically recover multiple related databases in a secondary region after a catastrophic failure or other unplanned event that results in full or partial loss of the SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance availability in the primary region.<br><br>Box 2: Business critical -<br>SQL Managed Instance is available in two service tiers:<br>General purpose: Designed for applications with typical performance and I/O latency requirements.<br>Business critical: Designed for applications with low I/O latency requirements and minimal impact of underlying maintenance operations on the workload.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/auto-failover-group-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview",

Only option left: elastic pool.  Makes sense since we're using 2 DBs.\n\nRegarding the tier:\nGeneral Purpose fits the bill for zone redundancy - you can turn on Zone Redundancy in GP.  However... they also want high IOPS (requirement 3).  So that means Business Critical or Hyperscale (500 IOPS per vCore with 7,000 maximum IOPS in GP, 8,000 IOPS per vCore with 200,000 maximum in BC an Hyperscale has 327,680 IOPS with max local SSD). \n\nI'm not sure if you can use Hyperscale with elastic pools (portal won't let me select it in my lab), so I'd go for Business Critical."
