Took ownership of a file in the test folder and could clearly see the corresponding logs in the Security event log. I then turned off Audit object access, then changed the owner again, this time there were no log entries. Doesn't look like you need to enable Audit sensitive privilege use in this case if all they are asking for is who is taking ownership."

Removing inheritance at Folder A just means that it does not receive permissions from an parent folders.\n\nSo, at Folder A, user 1 and user 2 get Modify permissions, which does let you delete any folder or file under Folder A. User 3 has only read permission at Folder A. Once we get to Folder B, User 3 now receives the write permission for a total of Read and Write at Folder B, which allows you to add and edit a file, NOT delete it.

If the phone is not detected, the laptop will automatically lock after a set amount of time. To enable this feature, the Dynamic lock settings should be configured.\n\nE. Pair the Android device and the laptop: Pairing the Android device and the laptop via Bluetooth will allow the laptop to detect when the Android device is out of range, which means the user has left the area.

In a test lab, you can create a group of users without problem, but when you go into MMC, add the GPO Editor snap-in, click Browse, and click on the Users tab, the only two groups that appear are Administrators and Non-Administrators.  You can create other groups until the cows come home and they will not show up in that list.  While you're in there, notice the heading above the list of users and groups says \"Local users and groups compatible with Local Group Policy.\"  This issue is corroborated here: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/65fd90fb-2597-495d-88c3-d1bd6b86850a/add-groups-to-local-group-policy?forum=ws2016  Thus, this answer is incorrect.  You either need to apply group policy to each user individually, or get yourself a domain controller with Active Directory, create a domain, add the computer to it, create some domain users, add them to an OU (organizational unit) and apply group policy to that OU."

When you encrypt a removable drive with BitLocker to Go on a computer without a TPM, you're prompted to create a password to unlock the drive. This password is saved to a file called a \"startup key\" that is stored on the removable drive.

Since Computer 1 has the necessary password stored in the startup key file on USBDrive1, it can automatically unlock the drive."

If you are using a computer that does not have a BitLocker-protected operating system drive, the drive cannot be automatically unlocked. For removable data drives, you can add automatic unlocking by right-clicking the drive in Windows Explorer and clicking&nbsp;Manage BitLocker.

Therefore Computer3 is not able to access it either, besides that, Computer2 cannot connect to a domain controller even though it is a domain-joined resource, therefore it is off-line even for domain-joined computers.

Segment2 has no domain controller connectivity, so the active firewall profile is either private or public. This depends on the option the user selected when they first connected to Segment2. When connecting for the first time, Windows asks whether the PC should be visible in this network. If you choose Yes, Windows sets the network to private. If you choose No, Windows sets the network to public. If you don't make a selection, Windows sets the network to Public by default. File and printer sharing is disabled for the Public profile on Computer2. Share3 is on Computer3. Computer3 has not joined the domain and has enabled file and printer sharing in the private and public profiles. Access to Share3 is therefore possible."

The reason for this is that BitLocker requires a certain amount of unencrypted space on the system drive to store boot files and other system files that are required to start the computer. If there is not enough unencrypted space on the system drive, BitLocker will not be able to encrypt the drive.\n\nIn this scenario, Computer1 has only one 200-GB NTFS volume named C:\\ and 50 GB of unallocated disk space. To enable BitLocker on the C:\\ volume, you should create an additional volume by shrinking the C:\\ volume and creating a new partition with the unallocated space. You can do this using the Disk Management tool in Windows 10.\n\nOnce you have created an additional volume, you can then enable BitLocker on the C:\\ volume using the BitLocker Drive Encryption wizard."

While this is a valid approach for provisioning Windows 10 devices in an enterprise environment, it may not be the easiest or most practical solution for a small workgroup environment.\n\nWindows Configuration Designer is typically used to create provisioning packages that automate the deployment of Windows 10 settings, applications, and customizations across a large number of devices. However, in a workgroup environment with only 20 computers, manually copying and importing a Group Policy Object (GPO) or Local Group Policy Object (LGPO) to each computer may be a simpler and more straightforward solution.\n\nTherefore, answer A is not the best answer in this scenario, as it involves more complexity and effort than necessary."

If you set anything from Default Domain - Computer Configuration, it will replicate magically down to the LGPO - Computer Configuration. Even if the LOCAL user is part of the administrators group, he will receive those configurations. So, yes, User2 will be applied.\n\nBut this result above won't happen in anyway down to User Configuration in the Default Domain Policies. So, if you read again the question statement: \"user settings\", you will be confused as I am right now. So I do not know really what is the real choice here."

Rename the Roaming User Profile folder to Public1.man.\n\nBy renaming the roaming user profile folder to Public1.man, you can convert the profile to a mandatory user profile. This prevents changes to the user settings of Public1 from being saved to the user profile. Mandatory user profiles are read-only copies of a user profile, so any changes made to the profile during a user session are lost when the user logs off.\n\nOption A is incorrect because renaming the Ntuser.dat file to Ntuser.v6 does not prevent changes to the user settings from being saved to the profile.\n\nOption B is incorrect because renaming the roaming user profile folder to Public1.v1 does not prevent changes to the user settings from being saved to the profile.\n\nOption D is incorrect because renaming the Ntuser.dat file to Ntuser.man does not convert the profile to a mandatory user profile."
