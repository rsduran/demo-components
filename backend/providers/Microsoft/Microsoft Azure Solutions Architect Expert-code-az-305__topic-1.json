This satisfies the requirement to send a monthly email message to the manager of the developers listing the access permissions to Application1.\nAccess reviews also provide the option to automatically revoke access if the reviewer does not verify an access permission, which fulfills the requirement to automatically revoke permissions if the manager does not verify them.\nImplementing an access review in Azure AD requires minimal development effort and can be set up through the Azure portal with a few simple clicks."

To reduce the risk associated with stale role assignments, you should regularly review access. You can use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to create access reviews for privileged access to Azure resource and Azure AD roles.

Policy assignments use managed identities for Azure resource authorization. You can use either a system-assigned managed identity that is created by the policy service or a user-assigned identity provided by the user. The managed identity needs to be assigned the minimum role-based access control (RBAC) role(s) required to remediate resources. If the managed identity is missing roles, an error is displayed in the portal during the assignment of the policy or an initiative."

User-assigned managed identities are standalone Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identities that can be assigned to one or more Azure resources, such as virtual machines. They can be used to authenticate to other Azure services like Azure Key Vault, Azure Logic Apps instances, and Azure SQL Database without the need for storing secrets and certificates on the virtual machines.\n\nBy using a user-assigned managed identity, you can easily assign the same identity to multiple virtual machines, which avoids assigning new roles and permissions when you deploy additional VMs. This also minimizes administrative effort in managing identities, as the managed identity is automatically managed by Azure AD."

Users will sign in to App1 and App2 by using their contoso.com credentials.<br><br>App1 requires read permissions to access the calendar of the signed-in user. App2 requires write permissions to access the calendar of the signed-in user.<br><br>You need to recommend an authentication and authorization solution for the apps.

Any permissions granted at the root management group level do not cascade down to child management groups.\n\nIf you want the user to have the \"Contributor\" role for the child management groups as well, you will need to explicitly assign the \"Contributor\" role to the user at each child management group."

You can create policies that specify the required tags for resources, such as department, and enforce their usage across the subscription. This will help you categorize and group resources based on departments.\n\nTags, on the other hand, are key-value pairs that you can assign to resources. By assigning tags to resources with the department information, you can easily filter and group resources based on departments when generating compliance reports.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.

The Password Administrator and Helpdesk Administrator roles provide permissions to reset user passwords.\nTherefore, User1 needs the User Administrator role for the MarketingAU administrative unit to be able to create new user accounts.

The company has a main office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Rome.<br><br>Existing Environment: Active Directory Environment<br><br>The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There are no trust relationships between the forests.<br><br>Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and computer authentication.<br><br>Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&amp;D) department only. The R&amp;D department is restricted to using on-premises resources only.<br><br>Existing Environment: Network Infrastructure<br><br>Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest.<br><br>All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet.<br><br>An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.<br><br>The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.<br><br>Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance.<br><br>Existing Environment: Problem Statements<br><br>The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many resources for WebApp1 are underutilized.<br><br><br>Requirements: Planned Changes<br> -<br><br>Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years, including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication.<br><br>As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment.<br><br>All R&amp;D operations will remain on-premises.<br><br>Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure.<br><br>Requirements: Technical Requirements<br><br>Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:<br><br>\u2022\tWebsite content must be easily updated from a single point.<br>\u2022\tUser input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances.<br>\u2022\tWhenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost.<br>\u2022\tUsers must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity.<br>\u2022\tAny new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.<br>\u2022\tWhenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service.<br>\u2022\tAn email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services.<br>\u2022\tIn the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory.<br>\u2022\tDirectory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on-premises network.<br><br>Requirements: Database Requirements<br><br>Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:<br><br>\u2022\tDatabase metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings.<br>\u2022\tTo avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated.<br>\u2022\tDatabase backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements.<br><br>Requirements: Security Requirements<br><br>Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:<br><br>\u2022\tCompany information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside the company.<br>\u2022\tUsers on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet link fails.<br>\u2022\tAdministrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com credentials.<br>\u2022\tAll administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication (MFA).<br>\u2022\tThe testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.<br><br><br>To meet the authentication requirements of Fabrikam, what should you include in the solution?

Number of Conditional Access Policies: 2\nPolicy for MFA on Azure Portal Access: \n- All administrative access must be secured by MFA, this will require a Conditional Access Policy to enforce.\n\nPolicy for WebApp1 Testing Access: \n- The testing environment for WebApp1 should not be visible to those outside the company. So, a second policy is needed, which will restrict access to this testing instance based on criteria like belonging to certain user groups or logging in from specific internal IP addresses."

This makes it easier to track costs associated with a particular project across multiple subscriptions.  \nBudgets (Option A): Budgets in Azure Cost Management help you plan for and drive organizational accountability. With budgets, you can account for the resources used by your projects and monitor how spending progresses over time. Budgets will also alert you as you reach predefined budget thresholds.  \nSo, the correct answers are Resource Tags (Option B) and Budgets (Option A)."
