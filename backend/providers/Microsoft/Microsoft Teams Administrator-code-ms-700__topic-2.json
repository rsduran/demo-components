The Guest access settings primarily control the overall permissions and capabilities of guest users within the Teams environment, such as their ability to create and manage teams, channels, and chat.\n\nTo achieve the goal of preventing guest users from using cameras during Teams meetings, you would need to utilize more granular settings or policies. In this case, you can achieve this goal by using Microsoft 365 or Azure Active Directory policies.\n\nOne possible solution could involve creating a Teams meeting policy that applies specifically to guest users and restricts their ability to use cameras. You can then assign this policy to guest users in Azure Active Directory."

It allows them to access files, participate in chats, and join meetings within the designated team or channel. This aligns perfectly with the marketing department's need to collaborate on a PowerPoint presentation in a team's General channel.\nIT: External Access\nReason: External Access enables communication with external users via chat and calls, but without granting access to teams or channels. This suits the IT department's requirement for private chats and calls with external consultants without sharing internal team resources.\nExplanation of why other options aren't suitable:\nB2B Direct Connect: This feature is primarily for federating with other Azure AD organizations, allowing seamless collaboration between trusted partners.
