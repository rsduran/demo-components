For example, T-shirts can have sizes S, M, L, etc. while a model of shoes can have 40, 41, 42, 43, etc. as sizes.  Both can use the same configuration group, if size is the only dimension.\nThus, if I had to choose, I would say that creating the dimension group happens first, followed by the creation of sizes."

Click \"Activate\" in the action pane.\n\nNotice how the cost price as shown in the cost category is still $0 until the cost price version has been activated."
