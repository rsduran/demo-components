This article (https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/exchange/microsoft-exchange-server-licensing-licensing-overview?rtc=1) says that for Standard license there is journaling only per database so i think for Accounting department the right option may be database journaling. Correct me if i'm wrong."

You can deliver journal reports to an on-premises archiving system or a third-party archiving service. If you're running an Exchange hybrid deployment with your mailboxes split between on-premises servers and Exchange Online, you can designate an on-premises mailbox as the journaling mailbox for your Exchange Online and on-premises mailboxes."
