Business Critical\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn Azure SQL Database Elastic Pool is a shared resource model that enables higher resource utilization efficiency. It allows multiple databases to share the same resources, which will be beneficial in this case where there are two databases, DB1 and DB2, to be migrated.\n\nBusiness Critical service tier provides high availability and low latency, and it is fully managed, which aligns with the business requirement to minimize administrative effort and the technical requirement to maintain availability if two availability zones fail. As you pointed out, the zone redundancy is still in preview for Managed Instances which can't guarantee the desired level of stability and reliability."

Business Critical service tier\n\nAzure SQL Managed Instance provides automatic failover within an availability zone and can be configured with auto-failover groups for cross-region disaster recovery. The Business Critical service tier provides high availability with several readable secondary replicas and fast failover within an availability zone. This configuration meets Litware\u2019s requirements for maintaining availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail, failing over automatically, and minimizing I/O latency.\n\nAn Azure SQL Database Elastic Pool is a cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases that have varying and unpredictable resource demands. However, based on the information provided in the case study, it does not appear to be the best option for meeting Litware\u2019s resiliency requirements for DB1 and DB2. Azure SQL Managed Instance would be a better choice for meeting these requirements."

To eliminate a single point of failure, the control ring is also duplicated across multiple zones as three gateway rings (GW). The routing to a specific gateway ring is controlled by Azure Traffic Manager (ATM). Because the zone-redundant configuration in the Premium or Business Critical service tiers doesn't create additional database redundancy, you can enable it at no extra cost. By selecting a zone-redundant configuration, you can make your Premium or Business Critical databases resilient to a much larger set of failures, including catastrophic datacenter outages, without any changes to the application logic."
