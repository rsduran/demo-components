Its easier to understand that explain unfortunately which is the problem with this. when you get it you just get it then. I was taught it 3 times in 3 different courses before it clicked."

This is a slightly convex surface with the apex of the curve accurately centered on the fiber, so that when the connectors are mated the fiber cores come into direct contact with one another.<br>Note: Optical fiber connectors are used to join optical fibers where a connect/disconnect capability is required. Due to the polishing and tuning procedures that may be incorporated into optical connector manufacturing, connectors are generally assembled onto optical fiber in a suppliers manufacturing facility.",

Dynamic routing consists of routing tables that are built and maintained automatically through an ongoing communication between routers.<br>* Most of the dominant routing algorithms are dynamic routing algorithms, which adjust to changing network circumstances by analyzing incoming routing update messages. If the message indicates that a network change has occurred, the routing software recalculates routes and sends out new routing update messages.<br>These messages permeate the network, stimulating routers to rerun their algorithms and change their routing tables accordingly.<br>* When there are multiple routes to the same destination, a router must have a mechanism for calculating the best path. A metric is a variable assigned to routes as a means of ranking them from best to worst or from most preferred to least preferred.",

This term, however, is used to refer to many different styles of shielding. The most common type of shielding uses what is called a screen. This screen is a metal covering that goes around the entire set of 8 wires found in CAT5e cable. This can be done by a single solid foil wrap around the wires, braided strands of cable wrapped around all the wires, or a combination of the two. This type of cabling is very effective at blocking any EMI that could cause problems in most installations.\nhttps://sewelldirect.com/blogs/learning-center/utp-cat5e-vs-stp-cat5e-cable"
