So, the endpoint is not enable to 10.2.9.0/24.\nA subnet mask of 24 bits basically means that the first 3 numbers of the IP are FIXED! Thus, the 10.2.0 will never change and the remaining number gives 256 subnet addresses. Then, an IP starting by 10.2.9 does not belong to the subnet that is allowed.\nFor fun try it on the portal, when configuring this option it forces you to select subnets, which means that, in order to provide access, they should be explicitly shown on the configuration screen."

On the Virtual network gateway page, click Create at the bottom of the page to open the Create virtual network gateway page.<br>Step 2: On the Create virtual network gateway page, fill in the values for your virtual network gateway.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03862/0038300001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03862/0038400001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Name: Name your gateway. This is not the same as naming a gateway subnet. It's the name of the gateway object you are creating.<br>Gateway type: Select VPN. VPN gateways use the virtual network gateway type VPN.<br>Virtual network: Choose the virtual network to which you want to add this gateway. Click Virtual network to open the 'Choose a virtual network' page. Select the<br>VNet. If you don't see your VNet, make sure the Location field is pointing to the region in which your virtual network is located.<br>Gateway subnet address range: You will only see this setting if you did not previously create a gateway subnet for your virtual network. If you previously created a valid gateway subnet, this setting will not appear.<br>Step 4: Select Create New to create a Gateway subnet.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03862/0038500001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Step 5: Click Create to begin creating the VPN gateway. The settings are validated and you'll see the \"Deploying Virtual network gateway\" tile on the dashboard.<br>Creating a gateway can take up to 45 minutes.

From my point of view private endpoints make sense if you have to grant access to a vnet from a single storage service. In fact, during the creation process it is possible to specify a target sub-resource. But the question states that apps can access all storage services. So it makes more sense to create a service endpoint from the Firewalls and virtual networks menu of the storage. Since there are two Azure Storage Account, we need to create a service endpoint in each storage and give access to the two apps through these endpoints."

You can detect threats targeting Azure services including Azure App Service, Azure SQL, Azure Storage Account, and more data services.

Along with the three copies of your data stored within a single region, a further three copies are stored in the twinned Azure region. So using GRS means you get all the features of the LRS storage within your primary zone, but you also get a second LRS data storage in a neighbouring Azure region.
