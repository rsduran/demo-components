Click the Safe Links tab to examine all existing Safe Links policies:<br>3. After navigating to the Safe Links policy page, choose the Add button (+) to create a new policy. The New Safe Links Policy window opens.<br>- In the resulting window we'll be presented with the options available for creating our new Safe Links policy.<br>4. In Name enter an appropriate, unique, name that describes this policy. In the description enter some text that provides a little more detail for anyone trying to make sense of the options selected here.<br>5. Next we'll choose the action to take for URLs. We can leave this Off, if for example we are creating a policy to exclude a group of users that would otherwise be affected by another Safe Links policy.<br>6. The checkbox Do not track user click can be selected if you do not wish to use the reporting functionality available at a later date. This is a key feature when understanding which users clicked a link that was later found to be a threat, so be careful about choosing to disable user click tracking.<br>7. Our final check box provides options for click-through is a link is found to be dangerous. In some circumstances you may trust users to click-through links, or they may request the ability to do so. In most circumstances you will not want a user to click-through the malicious link.<br>8. Some URLs, such as those for internal addresses or even trusted partners, may not require re-writing. Enter these URLs here.<br>9. Finally, we will select the scope for the rule under the Applied to section.<br>10.Using similar conditions to transport rules we can select who this rule applies to including:<br>- Individual recipients<br>- Recipient domains<br>- Members of distribution groups<br>11.The same conditions can be used for exceptions. When you have configured your rule, choose Save.<br>After saving the new Safe Links rule it will be shown in the EAC list. Just like Transport Rules, you can use the Enabled column to enable or disable the Safe Links policy.<br>Reference:<br>https://techgenix.com/implementing-exchange-online-advanced-threat-protection-part2/",

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com, go to Email &amp; Collaboration &gt; Policies &amp; Rules &gt; Threat policies &gt; Anti-spam in the Policies section. To go directly to the Anti-spam policies page, use https://security.microsoft.com/antispam.<br>2. On the Anti-spam policies page, click Create policy and then select Inbound from the drop down list.<br>3. The policy wizard opens. On the Name your policy page, configure these settings:<br>- Name: Enter a unique, descriptive name for the policy.<br>- Description: Enter an optional description for the policy.<br>When you're finished, click Next.<br>4. On the Users, groups, and domains page that appears, identify the internal recipients that the policy applies to (recipient conditions):<br>- Users: The specified mailboxes, mail users, or mail contacts in your organization.<br>- Groups: The specified distribution groups, mail-enabled security groups, or Microsoft 365 Groups in your organization.<br>- Domains: All recipients in the specified accepted domains in your organization.<br>Click in the appropriate box, start typing a value, and select the value that you want from the results. Repeat this process as many times as necessary. To<br>\u05b3\u2014<br>remove an existing value, click remove<br>next to the value.<br>For users or groups, you can use most identifiers (name, display name, alias, email address, account name, etc.), but the corresponding display name is shown in the results. For users, enter an asterisk (*) by itself to see all available values.<br>Multiple values in the same condition use OR logic (for example, &lt;recipient1&gt; or &lt;recipient2&gt;). Different conditions use AND logic (for example, &lt;recipient1&gt; and &lt;member of group 1&gt;).<br>- Exclude these users, groups, and domains: To add exceptions for the internal recipients that the policy applies to (recipient exceptions), select this option and configure the exceptions. The settings and behavior are exactly like the conditions.<br>When you're finished, click Next.<br>5. On the Bulk email threshold &amp; spam properties page that appears, configure the following settings:<br>- Bulk email threshold: Specifies the bulk complaint level (BCL) of a message that triggers the specified action for the Bulk spam filtering verdict that you configure on the next page (greater than the specified value, not greater than or equal to). A higher value indicates the message is less desirable (more likely to resemble spam). The default value is 7. For more information, see Bulk complaint level (BCL) in EOP and What's the difference between junk email and bulk email?.<br>By default, the PowerShell only setting MarkAsSpamBulkMail is On in anti-spam policies. This setting dramatically affects the results of a Bulk filtering verdict:<br>\u2711      MarkAsSpamBulkMail is On: A BCL that's greater than the threshold is converted to an SCL 6 that corresponds to a filtering verdict of Spam, and the action for the Bulk filtering verdict is taken on the message.<br>\u2711      MarkAsSpamBulkMail is Off: The message is stamped with the BCL, but no action is taken for a Bulk filtering verdict. In effect, the BCL threshold and Bulk filtering verdict action are irrelevant.<br>- Increase spam score, Mark as spam<br>and Test mode: Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings that are turned off by default.<br>*<br>The Contains specific languages and from these countries settings are not part of ASF.<br>- Contains specific languages: Click the box and select On or Off from the drop down list.

After the time period expires, the message is deleted, and is not recoverable. A valid value is from 1 to 30 days.<br>- Add this X-header text: This box is required and available only if you selected Add X-header as the action for a spam filtering verdict. The value you specify is the header field name that's added to the message header. The header field value is always This message appears to be spam.<br>- Prepend subject line with this text: This box is required and available only if you selected Prepend subject line with text as the action for a spam filtering verdict. Enter the text to add to the beginning of the message's subject line.<br>- Redirect to this email address: This box is required and available only if you selected the Redirect message to email address as the action for a spam filtering verdict. Enter the email address where you want to deliver the message. You can enter multiple values separated by semicolons (;).<br>- Enable safety Tips: By default, Safety Tips are enabled, but you can disable them by clearing the checkbox.<br>- Enable zero-hour auto purge (ZAP): ZAP detects and takes action on messages that have already been delivered to Exchange Online mailboxes.<br>ZAP is turned on by default.

To remove an existing value, click remove<br>\u2711  next to the value.<br>When you're finished, click Add senders or Add domains.<br>- Back on the main flyout, the senders or domains that you added are listed on the page. To remove an entry from this page, do the following steps:<br>\u2711 Select one or more entries from the list.

Furthermore, if you assign an E5 license to a new cloud user, it will automatically create a mailbox. So the whole Admin1 scenario is absurd.\nNow to the admin audit logs in EXCH 2019 - they will record any actions taken to modify objects in an Exchange organization by default. THIS exactly is what Forkbeard reports in his test, so I presume either he does it on EXCH 2019 or EXO is following the 2019 principle - in which case the online documentation regarding excluded verbs is not correct.\nSoooo, you either answer what happens in reality, or you answer what you read in theory.\nI'm afraid, that the \"correct\" answer will be the theory, simply because that's how the exam questions are created on the first place."

Increase the priority of Policy1.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Microsoft 365 Defender (formerly known as Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection), policies are evaluated in priority order, and the first policy that matches the conditions is applied. In this scenario, it seems that the \"Strict protection preset security policy\" (which is applied to the Executives group) is being evaluated before \"Policy1.\"\n\nTo ensure that Policy1 is applied to all members of the Executives group, you should increase the priority of Policy1. This way, it will be evaluated before the \"Strict protection preset security policy,\" and its settings will be applied."
