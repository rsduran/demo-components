Azure Arc\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/initiative-definition-structure\nInitiatives enable you to group several related policy definitions to simplify assignments and management because you work with a group as a single item. For example, you can group related tagging policy definitions into a single initiative. Rather than assigning each policy individually, you apply the initiative.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/overview\nAzure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multicloud and on-premises management platform."
