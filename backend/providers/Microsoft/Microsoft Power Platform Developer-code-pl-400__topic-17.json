After each policy execution, the remaining calls allowed in the time period are stored in the variable remainingCallsPerIP.<br>&lt;policies&gt;<br>&lt;inbound&gt;<br>&lt;base /&gt;<br>&lt;rate-limit-by-key  calls=\"10\"<br>renewal-period=\"60\"<br>increment-condition=\"@(context.Response.StatusCode == 200)\"<br>counter-key=\"@(context.Request.IpAddress)\"<br>remaining-calls-variable-name=\"remainingCallsPerIP\"/&gt;<br>&lt;/inbound&gt;<br>&lt;outbound&gt;<br>&lt;base /&gt;<br>&lt;/outbound&gt;<br>&lt;/policies&gt;<br>Note: The rate-limit-by-key policy prevents API usage spikes on a per key basis by limiting the call rate to a specified number per a specified time period. The key can have an arbitrary string value and is typically provided using a policy expression. Optional increment condition can be added to specify which requests should be counted towards the limit. When this call rate is exceeded, the caller receives a 429 Too Many Requests response status code.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: With renewal-period=\"30\" 200 calls/minute would be allowed.<br>B: This would increase the calls/minute limit to 1000.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-access-restriction-policies",
