It is the dataset that when refreshed can be the earliest point when the system can determine the business rule of the alert that the \"count of customers has reached 10,000\" so it should not be dependent on the type of visual but apparently it does. Maybe say for card that say shows me the count of customers it becomes relevant or makes sense because this actually shows me the actual count. The documentation on another page says \"Alerts can be set on visuals created from streaming datasets that you pin from a report to a dashboard\", so to me it saying it is not the visual but the dataset, the visuals is the means not the cause so it has to answer D)"

Though one can argue that the name could be changed after creation but I believe that isn't the case here.

When I click on the drop down option for \"Region\" value the DON'T SUMMARIZE option is already ticked (with the green arrow) so when I go to click it again, nothing happens, the table remains the same as the one shown in the question... I clicked on all the other options and it looks nothing like the example.

It requires wrapping the SUM with CALCULATE. https://exceleratorbi.com.au/lastnonblank-explained/ Without that wrap the the defined variable returns the date = 12 month before the last date in the Sales[OrderDate] regardless SalesAmount. So without the wrap, if your [OrderDate] ends in 3000-01-01, it will return 2999-01-01 (but imagine you got last sales only this year 2020! )"

It is not what is asked. The column concerned here is [Order_Amount]."

This is the only relationship between the tables.\"\nTherefore the first and in my opinion only step is A) to create a relationship between the Order table and the Store table, which is very easy, as both tables contains the StoreID.\n\nWith this relationship, the requested report is easily setup with a very simple bar-chart with the store-names at the X-as and the order-amount on the Y-axis.\n\nOption C is in my opinion therefore not needed.\n(C. To the Order table, add a column that uses the RELATED('Store'[Store_ID]) DAX formula.)\n\nComments welcome."
