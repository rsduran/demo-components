In https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/direct-routing-voice-routing it clearly states: \"while the voice route is assigned priorities, the SBCs in the routes are tried in random order\". To have calls failover from SBC1 to SBC2 you would need additional configuration (which could be via PSTN usages as you noted; using the -failoverresponsecodes switch could also be in use). With the absence of add'l information I agree that SBC1 is the best answer for the first, and we assume the failover requirement is covered with add'l configuration. As you say, not a great question."
