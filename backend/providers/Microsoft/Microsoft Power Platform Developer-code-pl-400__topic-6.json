To control access to data, you can modify existing security roles, create new security roles, or change which security roles are assigned to each user.

Before using this authentication type, you'll need to register your application with the service so that it can receive access tokens for the users.<br>For example, Register the application in Azure AD shows how to register an application with the Azure Active Directory service.<br>During the connection creation process, the user will be asked to enter the credentials for login to the service.

API keys are a common method of authentication and authorization for accessing APIs or services without requiring direct user authentication.\n- For configuring a website login that does not need encryption, you would typically use Basic authentication. Basic authentication is a simple authentication mechanism where the user's credentials (username and password) are sent over the network in an encoded format, but not encrypted."

The company does not have a system to keep track of the candidates that were not selected.<br><br><br>Current Environment<br> -<br><br>The recruiting process starts when an individual applies for a position on the company website. The individual may have found the position on their own, they may have been officially referred by an employee, or in some cases were contacted directly by a hiring manager and encouraged to apply.<br><br>Recruiters schedule an interview with a hiring manager and interviews with two senior team members. Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.<br><br>The recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.<br><br>The company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:<br><br>\u2022 JobPosting<br>- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser<br>- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser<br>\u2022 Contact (Job Applicant)<br>- Contact identifier<br>- First name<br>- Last name<br>- Time-Zone Offset<br>- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)<br>\u2022 Application proapplication<br>- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact<br>- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting<br>- pro_recruiterassignedid<br>\u2022 Interview<br>- Application - lookup to Application<br>- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting<br>- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)<br>- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value<br>\u2022 Referral<br>- Contact - lookup to Contact<br>- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser<br>- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting<br>\u2022 SystemUser<br>- Manager - lookup to SystemUser<br>- Time-Zone Offset<br>\u2022 Recruiter<br>- Recruiter identifier<br>- Recruiter name<br><br><br>Applications<br> -<br>There may be multiple applications associated with each job posting. Applications are linked to an employee record if an employee referred the applicant for a position. The same individual can be an applicant for multiple job postings.<br><br><br>Interviews<br> -<br>Each interview is performed by an employee and is related to a single application.<br><br>The interview scheduling process may force potential candidates to accept interviews at unusual times with the senior team members due to time-zone differences.<br><br>Requirements. Interview Scheduling<br><br>The system must provide recruiters with a list of team members and their time-zone information. You must create a Microsoft Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control for the Job Application form to display a list of senior team members who report directly to a hiring manager.<br><br>\u2022 The control must display the current time in each team member's local time.<br>\u2022 The control must be bound so that it minimizes the amount of code that must be written.<br>\u2022 You must display the list of team members and sort the list to show team members who reside in time zones closest to the applicant's time zone first.<br><br>You must develop a second PCF control that displays the time-zone name and current time on the Job Application form. You must display the data in the candidate\u2019s local time.<br><br>Requirements. Historical Information Tracking<br><br>You must create a process to identify individuals as a person of interest that the company should consider hiring. You must assign each individual a score based on their past interactions.<br><br>\u2022 You must be able to determine the following information about a candidate:<br>- The number of interviews in the past two years and whether team members provided recommendations<br>- The number of hiring manager referrals and employee referrals in the past two years<br>- Whether the individual has any of the 12 designations or certifications that the company considers significant<br>\u2022 Only a single referral can be made per job application. The system must be able to support multiple referrals for a candidate.<br>\u2022 The system must track referrals even if an application is not completed.<br><br>Requirements. Historical Information Scoring<br><br>The automated process must run weekly to assess all candidates. The process must also run automatically when historical information is updated. You must be able to perform scoring by selecting a command button on the contact form.<br><br>\u2022 This new command button must only be visible to employees who belong to a security role assigned named Recruiter. The command button must not be visible to anyone unless the contact form is in Update mode.<br>\u2022 A person of interest is defined as having a score of 15 or more based on the following historical information criteria:<br>- Each interview with a recommendation adds two to the score.<br>- Each interview without a recommendation subtracts two from the score.<br>- Each employee or manager referral adds one to the score.<br>- Each designation or certification adds one to the score.<br>\u2022 All scoring elements must be recalculated when changes occur. You must assign the score to the Person of interest field.<br>\u2022 Values representing totals or scores must be stored in their own numeric fields.<br>\u2022 Plug-ins must be used to keep the Person of Interest field on active interview records associated with the Contact.<br>\u2022 Plug-ins registered on the update of the Person of interest field must send an email notification when the candidate named in the email is a person of interest. Recruiters must receive the message when the field is updated on the Contact record.<br>\u2022 Interviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the interview record is successfully updated.<br><br>Requirements. Design Guidelines<br><br>The following design guidelines must be followed:<br><br>\u2022 Schema changes must be made using the method requiring the least amount of storage to meet the requirement.<br>\u2022 Out-of-the-box functionality must be used when possible.<br>\u2022 Any code required to calculate scores must be able to be run from a single point.<br>\u2022 Email notifications need to be kept to a minimum.<br><br><br>Issues<br> -<br><br>\u2022 Recruiters report that the command button to score a candidate is not working. You debug the code and observe that the context input parameter is null.<br>\u2022 The system does not support associating designations and certifications with candidates.<br>\u2022 The value for the field used by the PCF control to display local time is saved to Microsoft Dataverse each time an active application record is opened.<br>\u2022 Interviewers report that they do not receive email notifications when interview records are created for an existing person of interest.<br><br><br>You need to implement scoring.<br><br>Which methods should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate methods to the correct actions. Each method may be used once, more than once, or not at all.
