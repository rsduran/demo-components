    "answerDescription": "Backup Operations in Hyper-V -<br>No VSS Writer Available?<br>In some cases, you need an Application-consistent backup but there is no VSS writer available. One example of this is MySQL. Hyper-V backups of virtual machines containing MySQL will always result in either a crash consistent or an image-level backup. For MySQL, the latter is probably acceptable as MySQL doesn't perpetually expand the log file. However, if you're using MySQL within a VSS-aware VM, then a Hyper-Vbased backup tool is going to take a crash- consistent backup. MySQL (like any other database system) isn't always recoverable from a crash-consistent backup; tool is going to take a crash-consistent backup. MySQL (like any other database system) isn't always recoverable from a crash-consistent backup; even when recovery is possible, it may be painful.<br>MySQL is just one example; any number of line-of-business Applications could tell a similar tale. In the case of MySQL, one solution is to find a guest-level backup<br>Application that is MySQL- aware and can back it up properly. For Applications for which no backup Application has a plug-in, you may need to have pre- and post-backup scripts that stop services or close Applications. If brief downtime is acceptable, you can disable the Backup item in Hyper-V Integration Services, thereby forcing Hyper-V to save the state of the VM during backup. This technique results in an image-level backup and can be used on any Application that doesn't have a VSS writer.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02146/0000700001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>References:<br>https://www.altaro.com/hyper-v/vss-crash-consistent-vs-application-consistent-vss-backups-post-2-of-2/",

To avoid storage I/O performance being affected with iSCSI or FCoE, it is recommended that you provide a dedicated network for storage traffic so that other network traffic does not interfere with this data. For this reason it is recommended that you do not use this network for cluster traffic, live migration or any other use.

However, you might want to provide an offsite replica VM for a clustered VM. In this scenario, you would provide two levels of fault tolerance. The failover cluster is used to provide local fault tolerance, for example, if a physical node fails within a functioning data center. The offsite replica VM, on the other hand, could be used to recover only from site level failures, for example, in case of a power outage, weather emergency, or natural disaster. The steps to configure a replica VM for a clustered VM differ slightly from the normal configuration, but they aren't complicated. The first difference is that you begin by opening Failover Cluster Manager, not Hyper-V<br>Manager. In Failover Cluster Manager, you then have to add a failover cluster role named Hyper-V Replica Broker to the cluster. (Remember, the word \"role\" is now used to describe a hosted service in a failover cluster.) To add the Hyper-V Replica Broker role, right-click the Roles node in Failover Cluster Manager and select Configure Role. This step opens the High Availability Wizard. In the High Availability Wizard, select Hyper-V Replica Broker as shown in Figure 12-28:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02146/0033600001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>When you choose this role, the High Availability Wizard will then ask you to provide a NetBIOS name and IP address to be used as the connection point to the cluster (called a client access point, or CAP).<br>This step is shown in Figure 12-29.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02146/0033700001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Next, you configure the equivalent of the server replication settings shown earlier in Figure 12-13.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02146/0033800001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>To do so, right-click the Hyper-V Replica Broker node in Failover Cluster Manager, and select Replication Settings from the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 12-<br>30. The difference between the settings here and the settings in Figure 12-13 is that in this case, the settings Apply to the entire cluster as a whole.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02146/0033900001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>On the remote Replica server, you configure replication as you normally would, by configuring Hyper-V Settings in Hyper-V Manager as described in the earlier section named \"Configuring Hyper-V physical host servers.\" However, if you want the remote Replica also to be a multi-node failover cluster, then you would need to configure that remote failover cluster through Failover Cluster Manager (by adding and configuring the Hyper-V Replica Broker role). After you configure the host server settings, you can configure replication on the VM in Failover Cluster Manager just as you would in Hyper-V Manager. Right-click the clustered VM, click Replication, and then click Enable Replication, as shown in Figure 12-31.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02146/0034000001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>This step opens the same Enable Replication wizard that you see when you configure replication on a nonclustered VM. The remaining configuration steps are<br>Remember first of all that you use Failover Cluster Manager to configure replication for a clustered VM at the primary site but still use Hyper-V Manager at the<br>Replica site. Remember that in Failover Cluster Manager at the primary site, you need to add the Hyper-V Replica Broker role to the failover cluster, and that this role is used to configure Hyper-V Replica \"server\" settings for the cluster. Finally, you also need to remember that when you configure Hyper-V Replica in a failover cluster, the CAP name and address are used as the server name and address.",

Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012 R2 introduces support for moving virtual machine storage without downtime by making it possible to move the storage while the virtual machine remains running. You can perform this task by using a new wizard in Hyper-V Manager or by using new Hyper-V cmdlets for Windows PowerShell. You can add storage to either a stand-alone computer or to a Hyper-V cluster, and then move virtual machines to the new storage while the virtual machines continue to run. The most common reason for moving a virtual machine's storage is to update the physical storage that is available to Hyper-V. You can also move virtual machine storage between physical storage devices, at run time, to respond to reduced performance that results from bottlenecks in the storage throughput.<br>Key benefits Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012 R2 makes it possible to move virtual machine storage while a virtual machine is running. Requirements You need the following to use the Hyper-V functionality of moving virtual machine storage:<br>One or more installations of Windows Server 2012 R2 with the Hyper-V role installed. A server that is capable of running Hyper-V. Specifically, it must have processor support for hardware virtualization.<br>Virtual machines that are configured to use only virtual hard disks for storage. NOTE: You cannot move the storage of a virtual machine when any of its storage is directly attached to a physical disk. Technical overview.<br>This new feature allows you to move the virtual hard disks of a virtual machine while those virtual hard disks remain available for use by the running virtual machine. When you move a running virtual machine's virtual hard disks, Hyper-V performs the following steps, as shown in Figure 1:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02146/0039900001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><br>Throughout most of the move operation, disk reads and writes go to the source virtual hard disk. While reads and writes occur on the source virtual hard disk, the disk contents are copied to the new destination virtual hard disk. After the initial disk copy is complete, disk writes are mirrored to both the source and destination virtual hard disks while outstanding disk changes are replicated. After the source and destination virtual hard disks are completely synchronized, the virtual machine switches over to using the destination virtual hard disk. The source virtual hard disk is deleted.",

Windows<br>Server 2003 PKI Applications look in the CRL distribution point extension for a URL that points to a network location from which the CRL object can be retrieved.<br>Because CRLs for enterprise CAs are stored in Active Directory, they can be accessed by means of LDAP. In comparison, because CRLs for stand-alone CAs are stored in a directory on the server, they can be accessed by means of HTTP, FTP, and so on as long as the CA is online. Therefore, you should set the CRL distribution point after the CA has been installed.<br>The system account writes the CRL to its distribution point, whether the CRL is published manually or is published according to an established schedule.<br>Therefore you must ensure that the system accounts for CAs have permission to write to the CRL distribution point. Because the CRL path is also included in every certificate, you must define the CRL location and its access path before deploying certificates. If an Application performs revocation checking and a valid<br>CRL is not available on the local computer, it rejects the certificate.<br>You can modify the CRL distribution point by using the Certification Authority MMC snap-in. In this way, you can change the location where the CRL is published to meet the needs of users in your organization. You must move the CRL distribution point from the CA configuration folder to a Web server to change the location of the CRL, and you must move each new CRL to the new distribution point, or else the chain will break when the previous CRL expires.<br><br>Note -<br>On root CAs, you must also modify the CRL distribution point in the CAPolicy.inf file so that the root CA certificate references the correct CDP and AIA paths, if specified. If you are using certificates on the Internet, you must have at least one HTTPs-accessible location for all certificates that are not limited to internal use. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771079.aspx<br>Configuring Certificate Revocation<br>It is not always possible to contact a CA or other trusted server for information about the validity of a certificate. To effectively support certificate status checking, a client must be able to access revocation data to determine whether the certificate is valid or has been revoked. To support a variety of scenarios, Active Directory<br>Certificate Services (AD CS) supports industry-standard methods of certificate revocation. These include publication of certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and delta<br>CRLs, which can be made available to clients from a variety of locations, including Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Web servers, and network file shares.",
