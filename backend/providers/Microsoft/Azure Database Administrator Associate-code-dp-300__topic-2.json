There's no way to view any data or code inside the enclave from the outside, even with a debugger. These properties make the secure enclave a trusted execution environment that can safely access cryptographic keys and sensitive data in plaintext, without compromising data confidentiality."

        "content": "Firewall Rule\nC) Allow traffic from a specific Virtual Network\nThis option is the most secure and aligns with the principle of least privilege by restricting access to only the specified virtual network, which contains your VMs. By allowing traffic from a specific Virtual Network, you ensure that only resources within that network can access the database, minimizing exposure to unauthorized access.\nNetwork Connectivity\nB) Create a private endpoint\nCreating a private endpoint allows secure connectivity to DB1 from your VMs over the Azure backbone network. This method ensures that traffic does not traverse the public internet, enhancing security and performance. It also simplifies network management by using private IP addresses for communication."
