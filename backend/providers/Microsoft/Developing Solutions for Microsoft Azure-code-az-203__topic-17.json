    "answerDescription": "Before you can connect to on-premises data sources from Azure Logic Apps, download and install the on-premises data gateway on a local computer. The gateway works as a bridge that provides quick data transfer and encryption between data sources on premises (not in the cloud) and your logic apps.<br>The gateway supports BizTalk Server 2016.<br>Note: Microsoft have now fully incorporated the Azure BizTalk Services capabilities into Logic Apps and Azure App Service Hybrid Connections.<br>Logic Apps Enterprise Integration pack bring some of the enterprise B2B capabilities like AS2 and X12, EDI standards support<br>Scenario: The Shipping Logic app must meet the following requirements:<br>\u2711 Support the ocean transport and inland transport workflows by using a Logic App.<br>\u2711 Support industry standard protocol X12 message format for various messages including vessel content details and arrival notices.<br>\u2711 Secure resources to the corporate VNet and use dedicated storage resources with a fixed costing model.<br>\u2711 Maintain on-premises connectivity to support legacy applications and final BizTalk migrations.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install",

        "content": "Azure VPN gateway is used to connect only to IAAS such as VM, VMSS which has a Private IP address from On-Prem to Azure. The communication is over IKE protocol. You need a Gateway in Azure as well as a VPN device in On-Prem to connect using this mode. \n\nUsing On-Prem Data Gateway you can communicate to Azure SAAS and PAAS services over HTTP/HTTPS. You only need Gateway at On-Premises, no gateway is required in Azure end. \n\nSo I guess the answer is correct.\nhttps://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/c3ac7770-319c-4d60-8107-0a08d8da5d9e/difference-between-vpn-gateway-and-on-premise-data-gateway"

        "content": "I'm not convinced it's correct. Data Gateway gives access to on-prem \"data sources\" from Logic Apps. \n\nBUT, are \"legacy apps\" data sources? No. What on-prem data sources do the Logic Apps call? None. Yes, BizTalk contains a number of databases -- MsgBox, Mngmt, etc. -- but we are not running BizTalk in the cloud, so we don't need access to these data from the new Logic Apps.\n\nIf we assume \"legacy apps\" means literally \"apps\", then I think they are just asking for general site-to-site access so we can call legacy apps from cloud solution, view BTS schemas, etc. as we perform the migration. I vote for site-to-site VPN."
