While users may tolerate a certain amount of slowness, Impact gives you insight into how best to balance optimization and performance to maximize user conversion.<br><br>Box 3: Retention -<br>The retention feature in Azure Application Insights helps you analyze how many users return to your app, and how often they perform particular tasks or achieve goals. For example, if you run a game site, you could compare the numbers of users who return to the site after losing a game with the number who return after winning. This knowledge can help you improve both your user experience and your business strategy.<br><br>Box 4: User flows -<br>The User Flows tool visualizes how users navigate between the pages and features of your site. It's great for answering questions like:<br>\u2711 How do users navigate away from a page on your site?<br>\u2711 What do users click on a page on your site?<br>\u2711 Where are the places that users churn most from your site?<br>\u2711 Are there places where users repeat the same action over and over?<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>Funnel: If your application involves multiple stages, you need to know if most customers are progressing through the entire process, or if they are ending the process at some point. The progression through a series of steps in a web application is known as a funnel. You can use Azure Application Insights Funnels to gain insights into your users, and monitor step-by-step conversion rates.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-impact",

Let\u2019s say if I have a web app with a catalogue of 500 products and every product has a detail page from which the user has the option to purchase the product. Now, I want to know the top 10 product detail pages that ended up leading to a purchase.\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t think that Funnels would be appropriate here. When you create a funnel, you have to specify the steps of the flow. I think that the main goal of a funnel is to analyse the transitions between steps in order to check if users get stuck in a step. Or in other words, how many people completed the flow.\nFunnels are to be used in known and specific flows, like when a user signup. That\u2019s not what the question is about. The question is about knowing what pages tend to lead more to a purchase. This is not a specific flow, you don\u2019t know the exact steps."

The recorded response time includes the time taken to get these files. The test fails if any of these resources can't be successfully downloaded within the timeout for the whole test. If the option isn't enabled, the test only requests the file at the URL that you specified. Enabling this option results in a stricter check. The test might fail for cases that aren't noticeable from manually browsing through the site.\n2. When the test fails, it's retried after a short interval. A failure is reported only if three successive attempts fail. Subsequent tests are then performed at the usual test frequency. Retry is temporarily suspended until the next success. This rule is applied independently at each test location. We recommend this option.

It provides insights into how your application is running, user interactions, and any issues within the application code.\nAzure Monitor agent (formerly known as Log Analytics agent) collects logs and metrics from the VM\u2019s operating system and infrastructure.

These metrics are crucial for understanding the health and performance of the underlying infrastructure that your application runs on."

Choose AOF persistence if your primary goal is to minimize data loss, and you can handle a lower throughput for your cache. Choose RDB persistence if you wish to maintain optimal throughput on your cache, but still want a mechanism for data recovery."

So, in theory we can recover everything up to the moment of failure.\n2) Additionally, we'll enable Secondary Storage for AOF, which will help to restore Redis image if primary zone was fully destroyed.\n\nWhy RDB is worse?

Increase the App Configuration cache expiration from the default value is a valid consideration for reducing the number of requests made to App Configuration APIs, but it does not directly address the requirement of dynamic configuration updates without causing the application to restart.\n\nIn fact, the default behavior of Azure App Configuration already includes caching to minimize the number of requests to the configuration store.

Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff.<br><br><br>Corporate website<br> -<br>\u2022\tThe company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources.<br><br><br>Farms<br> -<br>\u2022\tThe company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications.<br><br><br>Distributors<br> -<br>\u2022\tDistributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data.<br><br><br>Requirements<br> -<br><br>The application components must meet the following requirements:<br><br><br>Corporate website<br> -<br>\u2022\tThe site must be migrated to Azure App Service.<br>\u2022\tCosts must be minimized when hosting in Azure.<br>\u2022\tApplications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources.<br>\u2022\tAll code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production.<br>\u2022\tFile transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase.<br>\u2022\tAll site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit.<br>\u2022\tA queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests.<br><br><br>Farms<br> -<br>\u2022\tFarmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID.<br><br><br>Distributors<br> -<br>\u2022\tThe company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs.<br>\u2022\tAPI telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data.<br><br><br>Internal staff<br> -<br>\u2022\tApp and API updates must be validated before release to production.<br>\u2022\tStaff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update.<br>\u2022\tStaff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID.<br><br><br>Security<br> -<br>\u2022\tAll web communications must be secured by using TLS/HTTPS.<br>\u2022\tWeb content must be restricted by country/region to support corporate compliance standards.<br>\u2022\tThe principle of least privilege must be applied when providing any user rights or process access rights.<br>\u2022\tManaged identities for Azure resources must be used to authenticate services that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication.<br><br><br>Issues<br> -<br><br><br>Corporate website<br> -<br>\u2022\tFarmers report HTTP 503 errors at the same time as internal staff report that CPU and memory usage are high.<br>\u2022\tDistributors report HTTP 502 errors at the same time as internal staff report that average response times and networking traffic are high.<br>\u2022\tInternal staff report webpage load sizes are large and take a long time to load.<br>\u2022\tDevelopers receive authentication errors to Service Bus when they debug locally.<br><br><br>Distributors<br> -<br>\u2022\tMany API telemetry values are sent in a short period of time. Telemetry traffic, data costs, and storage costs must be reduced while preserving a statistically correct analysis of the data points sent by the APIs.<br><br><br>You need to resolve the authentication errors for developers.<br><br>Which Service Bus security configuration should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.<br><br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/az-204/image517.png\">",

This role is appropriate for developers who need to debug Service Bus as it provides comprehensive access to the data plane, including both sending and receiving messages, which are essential capabilities for debugging.\n\nService Bus Scope: Namespace. The Namespace scope is recommended if the developers need to work across multiple queues or topics within the same Service Bus namespace. If the debugging is limited to a single queue, then \"Queue\" could be more appropriate. However, \"Namespace\" offers more flexibility without being overly broad."
