In the evening, the company tells the users to attend at 16:50 on the machine where an attended desktop flow starts. The flow navigates to the website and the user is required to enter his username and password. That's why it is attended.

It is suitable for storing aggregated data.\nUnique Identifier: Alternate Key\n\nExplanation: An alternate key is a candidate key that is unique within the entity and can be used as an identifier. It provides an alternative way to uniquely identify records besides the primary key. This would be suitable for creating a unique identifier for your table.\nSo, the correct options are:\n\nFor the table of aggregated data: Fact Table\nFor the unique identifier: Alternate Key"
