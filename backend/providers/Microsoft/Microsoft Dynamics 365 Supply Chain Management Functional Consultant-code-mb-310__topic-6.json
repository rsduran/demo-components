E.g. you create the financial dimensions of departments and division; then create the values for each (what departments, what divisions). Finally, you create an account structure.\n\n...\n\nNow, that may sound pedantic, but financial dimension values and financial dimension sets really are completely different things, even though a lot of people, veterans included, would struggle to articulate the difference."
