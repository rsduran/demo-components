Therefore, it would make sense to provide two DNS servers for redundancy, instead of relying on a single server.\n\nAlso, to minimize administrative effort, it would be best to set these at the network level rather than individually on each virtual machine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nA. the DNS settings of VNET2 to use Server2 and Server1\n\nThis configuration allows the VMs in VNET2 to resolve both on-premises servers (through Server1) and Azure resources (through Server2). And if one DNS server fails, the other server can still handle the DNS requests, ensuring Azure Virtual Desktop remains operational. Also, setting the DNS servers at the VNET level simplifies management and reduces administrative effort."
