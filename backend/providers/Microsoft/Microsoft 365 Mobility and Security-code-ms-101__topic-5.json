The risk conditions can be used in combination with other conditions to create policies that best enforce your organizational requirements.\nMultiple risk-based policies can be put in place to target different user groups or apply different access control for different risk levels.\nConditional Access policies can be created through Microsoft Graph API and can be tested first in report-only mode.\nManage all access policies in one place in Conditional Access."
