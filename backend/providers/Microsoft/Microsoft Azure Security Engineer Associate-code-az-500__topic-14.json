Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n\nEnabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud is the first step to start using its security features and policies, including deploying security policies like SecPol1.\n\n\n\nIf you assume that Microsoft Defender for Cloud is already enabled, and you need to deploy SecPol1, then the logical next step would be to create an initiative.\n\nSo, the correct step in this scenario would be:\n\nC. Create an initiative.\n\nAn initiative in Azure Policy is a set of policies designed to help you achieve specific compliance goals for your resources. Deploying an initiative would allow you to apply SecPol1 and other related policies to your Azure resources."
