So, if I have an Enforced GPO on \"Staff\", but other sub-OUs with other GPOs for \"Marketing Staff\" and \"Finance Staff\", if there are conflicting settings, the Enforced GPO on Staff wins out.

In that respect, winload.exe is functionally equivalent to the operating system loader function of NTLDR in prior versions of Windows NT.<br>C: Windows Vista and later operating systems replaced the NTLDR with the Windows Boot Manager (BOOTMGR). The BOOTMGR file is located in the 100 MB system partition automatically created during the Window 7 and Server 2008 R2 installation. In Windows Vista and Server 2008 the file is located in the System<br>Partition. Once the computer is started the boot sector loads the BOOTMGR which in turn looks for an active partition.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B, D: In legacy operating systems the boot sector (boot strap loader) loads the NTLDR that would then look for the BOOT.INI.<br>Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista_startup_process",

Processing is in the order that is specified by the administrator, on the Linked Group Policy Objects tab for the site in Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). The GPO with the lowest link order is processed last, and therefore has the highest precedence.<br>3. Domain  Processing of multiple domain-linked GPOs is in the order specified by the administrator, on the Linked Group Policy Objects tab for the domain in GPMC. The GPO with the lowest link order is processed last, and therefore has the highest precedence.<br>4. Organizational units  GPOs that are linked to the organizational unit that is highest in the Active Directory hierarchy are processed first, then GPOs that are linked to its child organizational unit, and so on. Finally, the GPOs that are linked to the organizational unit that contains the user or computer are processed.<br>Reference: Order of processing settings<br>https://technet.microsoft.com/sv-se/library/cc778890%28v=ws.10%29.aspx",
