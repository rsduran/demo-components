Azure AD roles do not have permissions in Defender for Cloud.\nOnly Contributor and Owner roles at the Azure subscription level have sufficient permissions to create and assign security policies in Defender for Cloud. Contributor has less permissions than Owner, and because of that you should assign Admin1 the Contributor role.\n\n***Maybe the Contributor is the right answer."

By deploying the SSM agent, you enable the management of your instances from AWS Systems Manager, which can be used to run scripts, install software, and manage your EC2 instances remotely. This includes deploying the Azure Connected Machine agent across existing and future EC2 instances.\n    Conclusion: Deploying the SSM agent is crucial for automating the deployment of any additional software, including the Azure Connected Machine agent."
