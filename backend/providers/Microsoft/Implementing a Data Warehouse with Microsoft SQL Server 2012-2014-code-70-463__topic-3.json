    "answerDescription": "C: From question: \" The server name for the database must be set by using a parameter named ParamConnection when any package in the project is executed.\"<br>E: SSIS 2012 has introduced the concept of Project level connection managers. An SSIS project is generally more than one package. To simplify lives, the SSIS team now allows for the sharing of common resources acrossprojects, connection managers being one of those resources.<br>F: When a parameter is marked as required, a server value or execution value must be specified for that parameter. Otherwise, the corresponding package does not execute. Although the parameter has a default value at design time, it will never be used once the project is deployed.<br>Note:<br>* Integration Services (SSIS) parameters allow you to assign values to properties within packages at the time of package execution. You can create project parameters at the project level and package parameters at the package level. Project parameters are used to supply any external input the project receives to one or more packages in the project. Package parameters allow you to modify package execution without having to edit and redeploy the package.",

This role primarily uses the SQL Server Management Studio, rather than within the Data Quality Client application. Their server role is sysadmin.<br>The three other roles are information workers, data stewards who use the product directly by working in the Data Quality Client application. These roles include the following:<br>\u2711 The DQS Administrator (dqs_administrator role) can do everything in the scope of the product.<br>\u2711 The DQS KB Editor (dqs_kb_editor role) can perform all of the DQS activities, except for administration.<br>\u2711 The DQS KB Operator (dqs_kb_operator role) can edit and execute a project. They cannot perform any kind of knowledge management; they cannot create or change a knowledge base.
