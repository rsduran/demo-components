Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<br>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<br>You are creating Power Virtual Agents chatbot that captures demographic information about customers.<br>The chatbot must determine the group a customer belongs to based on their age.

This error message can guide the user on how to rephrase or clarify their request.\n\nC. Use a fallback topic: You can create a fallback topic that the bot activates when it encounters unrecognized input. In the fallback topic, you can provide responses or instructions to help users navigate the conversation or specify what to do if their input isn't understood.\n\nThese approaches allow you to handle situations where the bot doesn't recognize or understand user input effectively.
