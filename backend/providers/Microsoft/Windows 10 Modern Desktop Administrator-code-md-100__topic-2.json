If your device does not have an infrared camera (or any other biometric device such as a fingerprint scanner), you will see the message shown in the exhibit. The question states that Device Manager shows all hardware is working properly.  Therefore, it is not the case that the computer has an IR camera but it isn't working properly.  The problem must be that the computer does not have an IR camera.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: Windows 10 Enterprise is not required for Windows Hello.

For the home or small business user, you can run Setup.exe from a product media or from a network share.

To upgrade, you run setup from within the existing Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 environment, select the Upgrade option, and have it copy the Windows 10 files to the system drive from which it them updates the computer to Windows 10 while preserving all the existing setting and applications."

You share this code via network share, then whomever needs the upgrade will access this executable. Once this setup.exe is ran, you then go through the setup process of upgrading your system or does the executable code run itself without the user having to configure anything? Also, the setup.exe CAN be used for an upgrade. I read an article on the microsoft website, but can it be used for an in-place upgrade? I ask this b/c someone said an inplace upgrade cannot be executed via a ntework share. Sorry if this sounds dumb. The only way I can really apply something is if the overall process fully makes sense to me. I have to understand the details if that makes sense."

A user2 only logon script means a targeted lgpo, the rest would apply to others too (see link above)\n\nDenying the local logon right to User1 can be done in local computer policy, and you can also check the logon scripts there to make sure there are no scripts for User1 and Administrator.\n\nBut. If you put scripts into the user targeted LGPOs for either user1 or administrator, then requirement three fails because user targeted lgpo applies last, so scripts in there would run.\n\nMaybe they meant for us to name three?
