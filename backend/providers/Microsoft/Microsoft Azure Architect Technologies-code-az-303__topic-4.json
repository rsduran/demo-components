The document further explains the VPN option but also says that if the global networks are connected, you can skip this part. So VPN is not a must. \nHowever, there is another doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/auto-failover-group-configure?tabs=azure-portal#use-private-link\nThis is a much simpler setup where private link is the first step to achieve auto fail-over. \nIn my humble opinion, using VPN within Azure networks is essentially wrong, and hence answer B is correct."
