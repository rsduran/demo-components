It doesn't answer this question. I just checked it in the portal for the sample APIs I have. You can choose either an Azure Resource (in my case it's an Azure Logic App and it gives that radio button besides/before the HTTPS endpoint radiobutton). It also enables None/Basic/Client Certs choices. So this link doesn't say anything to answer.\nUnfortunately, I don't know the answer for sure because the if a REST service is not an Azure Resource (because it wasn't deplyoed as a Function), then the answer is HTTPs endpoint. And now, the cert can be basic or Client.\nI'm inclined to saying that it's HTTPS and Client Cert simply because it's a RESTful service which will need these to authenticate."
