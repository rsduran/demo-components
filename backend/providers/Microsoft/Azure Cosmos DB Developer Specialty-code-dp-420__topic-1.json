Create a single database that contains a container for orders and a container for order items.\nCreating a single database with two containers, one for orders and another for order items, is the best approach to support order read operations while minimizing the number of requests. This approach provides a clear separation of concerns between orders and order items, making it easier to manage the data and perform read operations.\nWith this approach, queries that require only order data can be directed to the orders container, while queries that require order item data can be directed to the order items container. This reduces the number of requests required to retrieve the data needed for each query."
