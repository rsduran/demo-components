Budget planning workflows are associated with budgeting workflows. Budgeting workflows are the automated and manual processes that move budget plans through the budget planning stages.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/budgeting/budget-planning-overview-configuration",
