The private IP address provides secure and direct connectivity to your PaaS service, in this case storage2, over a private link. This ensures that the data between your VNet and storage2 traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure to the public internet.\n\nThis method aligns with the business requirement of minimizing costs as it does not require any additional outbound data transfer costs that are associated with other methods like service endpoints. It also satisfies the PaaS networking requirement of making storage2 accessible from Vnet2 and Vnet3 without exposing the public endpoint of storage2.\n\nRemember to set up the necessary DNS configurations for Private Endpoint to ensure that the requests to storage2 are routed through the private endpoint."
