I don't think Hero Card has anything to do with authentication, \"A hero card is a basic card type that allows you to combine images, text and interactive elements such as buttons in one object and present a mixture of them to the user\" (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/how-to-send-cards?tabs=v2x)... The only thing close is Sign In Card, because it can prompt the user to sign in, from where we can get his/her name to greet them... That's what i think at least."
