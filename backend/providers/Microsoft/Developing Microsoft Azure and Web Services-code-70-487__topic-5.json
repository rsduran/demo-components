    "answerDescription": "Scenario: When home.aspx is displayed, the rendered page must be cached for 10 minutes.<br><br>Page output caching -<br>The output of an action method on a controller can be cached using the [OutputCache]attribute on the method. Actions methods that return views will have the rendered page cached, while methods returning JSON data will have that data saved. A number of properties on the OutputCacheAttribute class control how data is cached.<br>CacheProfile- If a number of methods will have the same cache settings, it makes sense to use the web.config file to create a cache profile that can be used across all these methods.<br>The Duration attribute of the CacheProfile determines how long, in seconds, the output should be cached. To save an item for 10 minutes, duration would be set to<br>600.<br>[OutputCache(Duration=600)]<br>References:<br>http://failedturing.blogspot.se/2014/10/microsoft-70-486-design-caching-strategy.html",
