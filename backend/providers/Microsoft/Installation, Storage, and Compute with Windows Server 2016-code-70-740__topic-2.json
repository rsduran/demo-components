This is a global setting for all Storage Replica traffic and therefore affects all replication from this server. Typically, this is needed only with Storage Replica initial sync setup, where all the volume data must transfer. If needed after initial sync, your network bandwidth is too low for your IO workload; reduce the IO or increase the bandwidth.\n\nThis should only be used with asynchronous replication (note: initial sync is always asynchronous even if you have specified synchronous). You can also use network QoS policies to shape Storage Replica traffic. Use of highly matched seeded Storage Replica replication will also lower overall initial sync bandwidth usage considerably.\n\nTo set the bandwidth limit, use:\n\n\nCopy\nSet-SmbBandwidthLimit  -Category StorageReplication -BytesPerSecond x"
