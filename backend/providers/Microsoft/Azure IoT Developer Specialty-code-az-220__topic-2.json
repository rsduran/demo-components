So, assuming that all the 10.000 devices are in the same enrollment group (because it's not specified), blacklisting the certificate affects all 10.000 devices.\nSo, you have to delete the enrollment entries for the 10000 devices and delete the device identity from the device registry in the IoT hub.

This enables you to apply more complex allocation logic beyond the standard allocation policy options provided by Azure IoT Hub.\n\nUsing the custom allocation policy, you can implement a load balancing strategy that distributes devices evenly between IoT hubs in the same geographic location, based on the current load and availability of each hub.
