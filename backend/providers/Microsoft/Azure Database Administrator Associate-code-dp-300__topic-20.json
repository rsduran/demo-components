Each event is part of exactly one window, and there are no gaps or overlaps between windows, which fits the requirement of continuous aggregation without gaps or overlaps.\nOther options:\n\u2022\tSliding window allows overlapping and could lead to redundant computations, which is not suitable for this requirement.\n\u2022\tHopping window can produce overlapping windows, which doesn't align with the requirement to avoid overlap.\n\u2022\tSession window is useful for identifying periods of activity followed by inactivity, but it would not be suitable for continuous aggregation as required in this scenario."
