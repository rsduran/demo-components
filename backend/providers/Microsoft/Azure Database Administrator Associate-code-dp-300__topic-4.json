From the documentation Force_Last_Good_Plan_On should be correct (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/automatic-tuning/automatic-tuning?view=sql-server-ver15)\n\nThe aha moment is that the cache only keeps one execution plan at a time.

        "content": "Since the question is specifically asking about reducing the time it takes to perform analytic queries on the database, the BATCH_MODE_ADAPTIVE_JOINS configuration should be enabled. This feature is designed to dynamically choose the optimal join algorithm based on the input data sets and available memory. It is particularly effective for analytical queries where the performance can benefit significantly from batch mode processing.\n\nWhile the BATCH_MODE_MEMORY_GRANT_FEEDBACK configuration can also help improve query performance by adjusting memory grant allocations for batch mode queries, it is not as effective as the adaptive join feature in the context of analytical queries.\n\nI think the answer is C."
