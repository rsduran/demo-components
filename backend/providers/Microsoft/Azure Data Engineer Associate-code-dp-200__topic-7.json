It is mentioned in the question that \"All services and processes must be resilient to a regional Azure outage.\"\nHowever, referred from the Microsoft docs: Geo-redundant storage carries a risk of data loss. Data is copied to the secondary region asynchronously, meaning there is a delay between when data written to the primary region is written to the secondary region. In the event of an outage, write operations to the primary endpoint that have not yet been copied to the secondary endpoint will be lost. \nThis concludes that RA-GRS is the correct answer as per Microsoft docs \"If an outage occurs in the primary endpoint, applications configured for read access to the secondary and designed for high availability can continue to read from the secondary endpoint. Microsoft recommends RA-GZRS for maximum availability and durability for your applications.\""
