From VM2, you can upload data to the blob storage of storage1? No\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n\nNSG rule: The outbound rule in the NSG denies all traffic to storage accounts (destination: Storage). This rule applies to both VM1 and VM2 as they are both in the VNets (VNet1/Subnet1 and VNet1/Subnet2) associated with the NSG.\n\nPrivate endpoint: The private endpoint (Private1) allows VM1 in Subnet1 to access the blob storage (target sub-resource: blob) of storage1. This creates a private connection that bypasses the NSG rule for VM1. However, VM2 is not in Subnet1 and doesn't have access through the private endpoint.\n\nTherefore, VM1 can leverage the private endpoint to access storage1 while VM2 is restricted by the NSG rule."

This setting only applies to private endpoints in the subnet and affects all private endpoints in the subnet.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview\nTo access more subresources within the same Azure service, more private endpoints with corresponding targets are required.

In this case we can use DNAT rule here. We choose source type which shows source which tries to communicate with vm which lives in spoke vnet behind AF.
