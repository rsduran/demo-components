This enables access for subsequent analysis steps.\n(2) Index the video by using the Azure Video Analyzer for Media (previously Video Indexer) API: Utilize Video Analyzer for Media to automatically extract key information like objects, actions, and emotions from the video. This provides valuable context for further analysis.\n(3) Extract the transcript from the Azure Video Analyzer for Media (previously Video Indexer) API: Leverage the same Video Analyzer for Media API to generate a transcript of the spoken audio in the video. This enables textual analysis of the content.\n(4) Translate the transcript by using the Translator API (optional): If your target audience uses languages other than the source language of the video, utilize the Translator API to translate the extracted transcript into the desired languages. This enables multilingual product descriptions or accessibility features."
