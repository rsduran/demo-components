H. sysadmin\n\nBasically a low privileged user who is able to read the audit logs would be able to know what is being audited and might be able to exploit vulnerabilities. For example, noting that the salary table is not audited, or that updates to salaries are being audited.\n\nThere are also ways of keeping administrators honest, for example I can configure auditing so that it if fails the SQL Server will be shut down. This is a logged operation that the dbas would need to explain to outside auditors.\n\nGranted your DBAs - your sysadmins can read the audit logs, but you need to have a level of trust with them. There are options to provided the level of trust you want to designate to certain people (members of the sysadmin role) and at the same time verify that they are being honest (having SQL Server shut down when there is an audit failure).\n\nAzure SQL Database is a provisioned database. It is not a complete server - which is why auditing is provided on a database level.\n\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/1488ebbf-e088-4c4c-b728-90f946dd3ca1/permission-required-to-read-audit-logs?forum=sqldatabaseengine"

This is designed for scenarios when permissions cannot be inherited through ownership chaining or when the ownership chain is broken, such as dynamic SQL. You can then create a user mapped to the certificate, granting the certificate user permissions on the objects the stored procedure needs to access."

The company has two offices: a main office in the city and a branch office just outside the city. The company has four factories where their products are manufactured. Two factories are in the New York area and the other two factories are in Washington.<br><br>Network Connectivity -<br>The two offices are connected by a 10 Mbps dedicated WAN link.<br><br>SQL Server Environment -<br>The main office has four SQL Server 2012 Standard Edition servers named MainDB1, MainDB2, MainDB3 and MainDB4. The branch office has two SQL Server<br>2012 Standard Edition servers named BranchDB1 and BranchDB2. The main office has a Development department. All databases used by the Development department are hosted on MainDB3 and MainDB4. MainDB1 and MainDB2 host the following databases:<br><br>Products -<br><br>Manufacturing -<br><br>Sales -<br><br>HR -<br><br>Customers -<br><br>DailyReportsTemp -<br>BranchDB1 and BranchDB2 host the same databases as MainDB1 and MainDB2. The DailyReportsTemp database is a temporary database that is recreated every day and used for reporting purposes.<br>One of the tables in the Customer database lists all the customers. Another table linked to the customers table contains a list of classifications for the customers.<br>The classifications are Hot, Warm and Cold based on the number of orders placed by the customers in the last year. The customers are classified according to the following criteria:<br>Hot - Over 100 orders placed in a year.<br>Warm - Between 50 and 100 orders placed in a year.<br>Cold - Under 50 orders placed in a year.<br><br>Stored Procedures -<br>Three tables in the Manufacturing database are modified by a stored procedure named ManProc1.<br>A segment of code from ManProc1 is as follows:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02200/0031700001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>The same three tables are also modified by a stored procedure named ManProc2.

The ProcessUpdateProc stored procedure contains several UPDATE statements. The UPDATE statements are configured to be called in a specific order. The ProcessUpdateProc stored procedure continues to run in the event of a failure of one of the UPDATE statements.<br>This can cause inaccurate results in the manufacturing process list.<br><br>Sales Director Statement -<br>The Sales Director has made the following observations about the current database design:<br>\u2711 The current customer classification system needs to be changed.<br>\u2711 Currently the customers are classified by the number of orders placed in the last year.<br>\u2711 This information is an unreliable guide as it does not take in to account the size of the orders.<br>\u2711 I would suggest a trial run of a classification system based on the revenue generated by the orders placed in the last year.<br>\u2711 We may add more than the current three classification types in future.<br>\u2711 We should have a method of recording changes to the classifications.<br><br>IT Manager Statement -<br>The IT Manager has listed the following requirements for the SQL Server and database environment:<br>\u2711 We need to provide a group of users from the IT and Manufacturing departments the minimum administrative rights to view database information and server state for the Manufacturing database on MainDB1.<br>\u2711 The Sales database takes too long to back up due to the large amount of historical sales order data in the database. We need to reduce the backup time for this database.<br>\u2711 The DailyReportsTemp database takes four hours to back up. We need to be able to recover the DailyReportsTemp database in less than one hour if the database storage hardware fails.<br>\u2711 We need to be able to immediately return the Manufacturing database to its previous state if the ProcessUpdateProc stored procedure fails to update the process information correctly.<br>\u2711 I also want the ProcessUpdateProc stored procedure to stop running in the event of a failure of one of the UPDATE statements.<br>IT Administrators need to be able to monitor the disk space used on the SQL Servers by running real-time reports on the disk usage.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02200/0031800013.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>\u2711 The Developers would like to install second instances of SQL Server on MainDB3 and MainDB4.<br>\u2711 They would like to assign each instance to specific processors on the SQL Servers.<br>You need to enable the Developers to assign SQL Server instances on MainDB3 and MainDB4 to specific processors on the servers.

The company develops software applications custom designed to meet customer requirements.<br>Requirements Leafield Solutions has been asked by a customer to develop a web-based Enterprise Resource Planning and Management application.  The new application will eventually replace a desktop application that the customer is currently using. The current application will remain in use while the users are trained to use the new webbased application.<br>You need to design the SQL Server and database infrastructure for the web-based application.<br><br>Databases -<br>You plan to implement databases named Customers, Sales, Products, Current_Inventory, and TempReporting.<br>The Sales database contains a table named OrderTotals and a table named SalesInfo.<br>A stored procedure named SPUpdateSalesInfo reads data in the OrderTotals table and modifies data in the SalesInfo table.<br>The stored procedure then reads data in the OrderTotals table a second time and makes further changes to the information in the SalesInfo table.<br>The Current_Inventory database contains a large table named Inv_Current. The Inv_Current table has a clustered index for the primary key and a nonclustered index.  The primary key column uses the identity property.<br>The data in the Inv_Current table is over 120GB in size.  The tables in the Current_Inventory database are accessed by multiple queries in the Sales database.<br>Another table in the Current_Inventory database contains a self-join with an unlimited number of hierarchies. This table is modified by a stored procedure named<br>SPUpdate2.<br>An external application named ExternalApp1 will periodically query the Current_Inventory database to generate statistical information. The TempReporting database contains a single table named GenInfo.<br>A stored procedure named SPUPdateGenInfo combines data from multiple databases and generates millions of rows of data in the GenInfo table.<br>The GenInfo table is used for reports.<br>When the information in GenInfo is generated, a reporting process reads data from the Inv_Current table and queries information in the GenInfo table based on that data.<br>The GenInfo table is deleted after the reporting process completes. The Products database contains tables named ProductNames and ProductTypes.<br><br>Current System -<br>The current desktop application uses data stored in a SQL Server 2005 database named DesABCopAppDB.

To help with the solution, Fabrikam has decided to use cloud resources as well as on-premise servers.<br><br>Physical Locations -<br>All of the corporate executives, product managers, and support staff are stationed at the headquarters office.  Half of the sales force works at this location. There is also a satellite sales office.  The other half of the sales force works at the satellite office in order to have sales people closer to clients in that area.

    "body": "Background -<br><br>Corporate Information -<br>Fabrikam, Inc. is a retailer that sells electronics products on the Internet.  The company has a headquarters site and one satellite sales office. You have been hired as the database administrator, and the company wants you to change the architecture of the Fabrikam ecommerce site to optimize performance and reduce downtime while keeping capital expenditures to a minimum.  To help with the solution, Fabrikam has decided to use cloud resources as well as on-premise servers.<br><br>Physical Locations -<br>All of the corporate executives, product managers, and support staff are stationed at the headquarters office.  Half of the sales force works at this location. There is also a satellite sales office.  The other half of the sales force works at the satellite office in order to have sales people closer to clients in that area. Only sales people work at the satellite location.<br><br>Problem Statement -<br>To be successful, Fabrikam needs a website that is fast and has a high degree of system uptime. The current system operates on a single server and the company is not happy with the single point of failure this presents.  The current nightly backups have been failing due to insufficient space on the available drives and manual drive cleanup often needing to happen to get past the errors.  Additional space will not be made available for backups on the HQ or satellite servers.<br>During your investigation, you discover that the sales force reports are causing significant contention.<br><br>Configuration -<br><br>Windows Logins -<br>The network administrators have set up Windows groups to make it easier to manage security. Users may belong to more than one group depending on their role.<br>The groups have been set up as shown in the following table:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02200/0040400001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Server Configuration The IT department has configured two physical servers with Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 and SQL Server 2014 Enterprise Edition and one Windows Azure Server.  There are two tiers of storage available for use by database files only a fast tier and a slower tier. Currently the data and log files are stored on the fast tier of storage only. If a possible use case exists, management would like to utilize the slower tier storage for data files. The servers are configured as shown in the following table:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02200/0040400002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><br>Database -<br>Currently all information is stored in a single database called ProdDB, created with the following script:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02200/0040400003.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>The Product table is in the Production schema owned by the ProductionStaff Windows group.  It is the main table in the system so access to information in the<br>Product table should be as fast as possible. The columns in the Product table are defined as shown in the following table:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02200/0040500001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>The SalesOrderDetail table holds the details about each sale.  It is in the Sales schema owned by the SalesStaff Windows group. This table is constantly being updated, inserted into, and read. The columns in the SalesOrderDetail table are defined as shown in the following table:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02200/0040500002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><br>Database Issues -<br>The current database does not perform well.  Additionally, a recent disk problem caused the system to go down, resulting in lost sales revenue. In reviewing the current system, you found that there are no automated maintenance procedures. The database is severely fragmented, and everyone has read and write access.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>Database -<br>The database should be configured to maximize uptime and to ensure that very little data is lost in the event of a server failure.  To help with performance, the database needs to be modified so that it can support in-memory data, specifically for the Product table, which the CIO has indicated should be a memoryoptimized table. The auto-update statistics option is set off on this database. Only product managers are allowed to add products or to make changes to the name, description, price, cost, and supplier.  The changes are made in an internal database and pushed to the Product table in ProdDB during system maintenance time.<br>Product managers and others working at the headquarters location also should be able to generate reports that include supplier and cost information.<br><br>Customer data access -<br>Customers access the company's website to order products, so they must be able to read product information such asname, description, and price from the<br>Product table.  When customers place orders, stored procedures calledby the website update product quantityon-hand values. This means the product table is constantly updated at randomtimes.<br><br>Customer support data access -<br>Customer support representatives need to be able to view and not update or change product information. Management does not want the customer support representatives to be able to see the product cost or any supplier information.<br><br>Sales force data access -<br>Sales people at both the headquarters office and the satellite office must generate reports that read from the Product and SalesOrderDetail tables.  No updates or inserts are ever made by sales people.  These reports are run at random times and there can be no reporting downtime to refresh the data set except during the monthly maintenance window. The reports that run from the satellite office are process intensive queries with large data sets. Regardless of which office runs a sales force report, the SalesOrderDetail table should only return valid, committed order data; any orders not yet committed should be ignored.<br><br>Historical Data -<br>The system should keep historical information about customers who access the site so that sales people can see how frequently customers log in and how long they stay on the site.<br>The information should be stored in a table called Customer Access.  Supporting this requirement should have minimal impact on production website performance.<br><br>Backups -<br>The recovery strategy for Fabrikam needs to include the ability to do point in time restores and minimize the risk of data loss by performing transaction log backups every 15 minutes.<br><br>Database Maintenance -<br>The company has defined a maintenance window every month when the server can be unavailable.
