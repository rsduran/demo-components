Because, the trick is in the \"less than one minute\" detail.\nYou can read about \"..10-minute delay in processing new blobs..\" in \"3-Minimizing latency\" description.\nMicrosoft says: \".....Use Event Grid instead of the Blob storage trigger for the following scenarios:\"\n1-Blob-only storage accounts: Blob-only storage accounts are supported for blob input and output bindings but not for blob triggers.\n2-High-scale: High scale can be loosely defined as containers that have more than 100,000 blobs in them or storage accounts that have more than 100 blob updates per second.\n3-Minimizing latency: If your function app is on the Consumption plan, there can be up to a ##10-minute delay in processing new blobs## if a function app has gone idle. To avoid this latency, you can switch to an App Service plan with Always On enabled. You can also use an Event Grid trigger with your Blob storage account. For an example, see the Event Grid tutorial.\n\nREFENCE: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger?tabs=csharp#event-grid-trigger\n\nI wish you a good day."

The Function App will scale to handle multiple images without pre-allocating resources.\nAzure Blob Storage Trigger: This trigger is designed to respond to new blobs (images) in a storage container.

It is not Consistent prefix because there is no control at all on how old the version you are getting. So, it has to be Strong.\nArgument 2: Because default consistency is Strong the writes will be synchronous in all regions. And the fact that this is Strong consistency shows that this is not multi-region writes because Strong consistency is not supported in Multi-region writes. So, a bounded-staleness will work (but it could be consistent prefix as well or even be eventual because all the replicas are kept in sync while writing. That part I'm still confused). But still making it Strong or Bounded-staleness does not matter for RUs considering both use local-minority for read. \nIn conclusion, I plan to bring a lawyer into the exam. Absolutely silly question with full vagueness from Microsoft\nBox 3: This could be eventual considering the good application developer has made it as events and there is no ordering required. But it is better to choose Consistent prefix instead of Eventual."

So Azure PowerShell cannot be used at this point but you can do it from Visual Studio Command Prompt as it has integration with OS CMD. \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/generalize\n\n- Second option is correct.

So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Azure AD.\n-\tUser-assigned: You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service.

Activity functions are the functions and tasks that are orchestrated in the process. For example, you might create an orchestrator function to process an order. The tasks involve checking the inventory, charging the customer, and creating a shipment. Each task would be a separate activity function. These activity functions may be executed serially, in parallel, or some combination of both.\n\nEntity functions\nEntity functions define operations for reading and updating small pieces of state. We often refer to these stateful entities as durable entities. Like orchestrator functions, entity functions are functions with a special trigger type, entity trigger. They can also be invoked from client functions or from orchestrator functions\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-types-features-overview"

It works by increasing the amount of time that is waited between each retry attempt, using an exponential function to calculate the wait time.\n\nFor example, with a coefficient of 2.0 and an initial retry interval of 1 second, the wait times between retries might be 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, and so on. This allows the system being accessed to recover from any failures or load spikes before the next retry attempt is made, reducing the likelihood of further failures."

CPU usage-based autoscaling\nThis is one of the most common ways to autoscale an Azure Web App. You can set a threshold for CPU usage, and when the CPU usage goes above that threshold, Azure will automatically add more instances. Similarly, when the CPU usage drops below a certain level, Azure will remove instances. This can be particularly useful if filling out the questionnaires is a resource-intensive operation.\nD. Predictive autoscaling\nPredictive autoscaling uses machine learning algorithms to predict future demand based on past usage patterns. If you have historical data that shows spikes in usage around the times when divers are filling out the questionnaire, predictive autoscaling can preemptively scale up before the demand hits and scale down afterward."

When you deploy a new revision, it replaces the current active revision.\nThis means that during the deployment process, the old revision is taken offline while the new one is brought up. This can cause a brief period where the application might be unavailable or not fully functional, resulting in potential downtime.\nMultiple Revision Mode:\n\nThis mode allows multiple revisions to run concurrently. When deploying a new revision, it can coexist with the old revision. Traffic can be routed gradually from the old revision to the new one, ensuring a smooth transition without downtime."
