Even so, if the right spot is found in between 2 races for our new Race, the options to set the Race.Faster and Race.Slower are not correct. If the current position is on the \"Faster\" race in the list, it means that the new Race has to have Race.Faster = current AND Race.Slower = current.slower. Evidently just \"current\" is not an option. \nI'm puzzled how come this problem came as an exam point - I really hope it's somehting really really smart that we do not understand, 'cause otherwise it's just stupid:)"
