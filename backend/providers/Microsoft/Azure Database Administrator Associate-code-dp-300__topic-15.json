A table that has an IDENTITY property\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nA surrogate key is a unique identifier for a record, and in SQL Server, the IDENTITY property is the most commonly used method to create surrogate keys. It automatically generates unique, sequential numbers, which is ideal for a surrogate key.\nThe requirement to account for changes to the retail store addresses suggests the need for a unique identifier that remains consistent even if store addresses change. An IDENTITY column is perfect for this because the values will not change as the data in the other columns (like the store address) changes."

The promotion ID will be associated to a specific product. The product will be identified by a product ID. The table will be approximately 5 GB.<br>A round-robin table is the most straightforward table to create and delivers fast performance when used as a staging table for loads. These are some scenarios where you should choose Round robin distribution:<br>\u2711 When you cannot identify a single key to distribute your data.<br>\u2711 If your data doesn't frequently join with data from other tables.<br>\u2711 When there are no obvious keys to join.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>Replicated: Replicated tables eliminate the need to transfer data across compute nodes by replicating a full copy of the data of the specified table to each compute node. The best candidates for replicated tables are tables with sizes less than 2 GB compressed and small dimension tables.<br>Reference:<br>https://rajanieshkaushikk.com/2020/09/09/how-to-choose-right-data-distribution-strategy-for-azure-synapse/",
