From my understanding, configuring Activation Boundary will install updates on devices that are not in use.

We can decide NOT to check the option for \"Automatic Maintenance\", which includes Activation Boundary and Random Delay. This question is once again quite non-specific.

So here the local GPO wins which is set to Not Configured. So the answer is NO\n\nComputer2 is in Group2. The Intune policy Ring2 applies to Group2 if the device has Tag2, which Computer2 does have, so this policy applies. No other policy is applied. Computer2 has a local GPO to set the deferral, but this will get override by the Intune CSP which says 7 days. So the answer is YES\n\nComputer3 is in Group3. The Intune policy Ring3 applies to Group3 if the device has Tag2, but Computer3 has Tag3 so this policy doesn't apply neither does other policies. Computer3 has a local GPO which disables the configuration of deferrals, which reverts to default, i.e, none. So the answer is NO"

The key here is personal data; Autopilot Reset basically only removes the user profile instead of wiping the entire OS drive. This makes Autopilot Reset a sort of middle-ground option, where you\u2019re wiping a device and maintaining the enrollment state but not maintaining the user data.\n\nAutopilot Reset also maintains the region/language/keyboard, any provisioning packages applied, and Wi-Fi connections. Autopilot Reset is the best option for re-using a device within your organization. You\u2019re basically removing the last user from a device and (depending on your Intune deployment configuration) handing it right over to the next person with no extra work needed"

This would require you to have a Windows 8.1 installation media and a product key. You would also need to backup all your data and programs, because during the process all data will be deleted.\n\nIt is also important to note that it's not always a good idea to downgrade the operating system, as it may lead to compatibility issues with new hardware and software and security risks."

This enables us to offer Microsoft Edge across all the platforms, such as Windows 7, Windows 8.1, iOS, Android and macOS. This also enables us to offer sync for non-primary accounts on Windows. In addition, we can ship Microsoft Edge at a more frequent and flexible release cadence than Windows. (For more information, see Windows updates to support the next version of Microsoft Edge. All these factors highlighted the need to re-assess Microsoft Edge participation in the ESR offering.\n\nESR is framed as a Windows product offering with promises about how data from Windows devices is handled, but Microsoft Edge sync will extend beyond Windows devices. And, as the data roams across these devices, it makes it difficult to define the Microsoft Edge sync offering in the context of ESR. To simplify how sync works and is managed, and to accommodate the changes that are highlighted, a decision was made to pull Microsoft Edge out of the ESR offering."

AP Reset will RETAIN previously configure OOBE settings, wipe user data, settings, and apps. The user will immediately be prompted to sign-in with his/her AAD creds. It is also NOT self-deploying profile as the option to prompt the user to accept the license agreement is GREYED OUT when configuring a self-deploying profile. Self-deployment mode is also specifically for shared devices/kiosks and isn't intended for individual users. A user-driven profile is our best answer here, although it's incomplete. To answer this question, we'd need to first create a NEW user-driven profile that allows the user to accept the license agreement. THEN, we'll need to reset the device so that the new user can configure language, locale, Wi-Fi connection, pull down the user-driven profile, and be prompted to accept the license agreement."

It allows for easy management of updates and enables IT administrators to delay or pause updates for a specific period of time.\n\nOn the other hand, WSUS requires a Windows Server to be set up and configured to manage updates. It also requires additional infrastructure and resources, such as storage and network bandwidth, as well as ongoing maintenance and management. Additionally, WSUS requires an additional license if you have a Windows Server that is not covered by Software Assurance.\n\nIn summary, Windows Update for Business is a less expensive solution, as it does not require additional infrastructure or licenses, while WSUS is more expensive as it requires additional infrastructure and ongoing maintenance and management."
