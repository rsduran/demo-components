One of two measures is required for this to happen:\n\n1 - Remove Group2 from Deny access to this computer from the network policy (LGPO or GPO).\n2 - Remove User6 from Group2 in the domain.\n\nAn extra step should still occur which would be any of the alternatives A, C and D.\n\nIt is mandatory that User6 be part of the Remote Desktop User group (local or domain). Or, as a last resort, breaking the principle of least privilege, add User6 to the administrators group (local or domain).\n\nSo the answer is B. Then it goes to the extra step."
