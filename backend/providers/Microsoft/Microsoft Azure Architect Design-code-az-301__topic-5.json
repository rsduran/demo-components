You set the policy that determines where data is stored, and SQL Server handles the data movement in the background. The entire table is always online and queryable. And, Stretch Database doesn't require any changes to existing queries or applications - the location of the data is completely transparent to the application.<br>D: The managed instance deployment model is designed for customers looking to migrate a large number of apps from on-premises or IaaS, self-built, or ISV provided environment to fully managed PaaS cloud environment, with as low migration effort as possible. Using the fully automated Data Migration Service (DMS) in Azure, customers can lift and shift their on-premises SQL Server to a managed instance that offers compatibility with SQL Server on-premises and complete isolation of customer instances with native VNet support.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/stretch-database/stretch-database https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance",
