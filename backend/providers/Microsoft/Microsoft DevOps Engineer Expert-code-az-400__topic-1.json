It is a robust option for teams looking for a complete solution for mobile app development and testing.\n\nOn the other hand, the Microsoft Test &amp; Feedback extension is specifically designed to facilitate the collection of feedback and manual testing in web and desktop applications, but it can also be used for mobile applications. It allows collecting bug reports, distributing beta versions, and obtaining user feedback. It is an option more focused on the manual testing phase and collaboration between development teams and end users."
