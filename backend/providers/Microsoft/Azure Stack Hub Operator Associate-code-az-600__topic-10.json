In the ASDK, this VM is named AzS-ERCS01. If you're using an integrated system, there are three instances of the PEP, each running inside a VM (Prefix-ERCS01, Prefix-ERCS02, or Prefix-ERCS03) on different hosts for resiliency.\nBefore you begin this procedure for an integrated system, make sure you can access the PEP either by IP address or through DNS. After the initial deployment of Azure Stack Hub, you can access the PEP only by IP address because DNS integration isn't set up yet. Your OEM hardware vendor will provide you with a JSON file named AzureStackStampDeploymentInfo that contains the PEP IP addresses.\nYou may also find the IP address in the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal. Open the portal, for example, https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external. Select Region Management &gt; Properties.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-privileged-endpoint?view=azs-2008#access-the-privileged-endpoint"
