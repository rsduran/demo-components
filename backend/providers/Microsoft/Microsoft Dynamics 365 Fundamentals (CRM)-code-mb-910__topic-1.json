They can be configured to route emails to the appropriate queues, teams, or users, and even apply conditions and actions to incoming emails. This feature allows for the automatic creation of cases from emails without the need for manual intervention.\n\nPlug-ins, on the other hand, are custom code extensions that can be used to perform various actions in response to events within Dynamics 365 Customer Service.
