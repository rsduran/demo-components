In addition, support for DUID will be added to the IPv4 registration on the DHCP client.\n\nNote this feature prevents name squatting due to non-Windows OS machines, for example servers with Mac OS, various Linux, and other variants of non Windows operating systems. In case of Windows OS machines it would not be an issue, as administrators can leverage upon Active Directory ACL functionality to limit access rights to a name to a particular user/machine and thus prevent name squatting. \u201d"

NAT is an IETF standard that provides a way for translating the IPv4 addresses of computers on one network into IPv4 addresses of computers on a different network. Of course, the DLS router on my Workplace network is also configured as a NAT router, so the result of implementing this approach is what is known as cascaded NAT or double NAT. Internet connectivity works fine through 2 or even 3 cascaded NATs, although a few applications can have problems with this type of network topology. For example, Windows Home Server doesn't seem to like cascaded NATs.\""
