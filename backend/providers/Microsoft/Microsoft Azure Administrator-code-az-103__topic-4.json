To add to the backend pool, write permission is required on the Resource Group because it writes deployment information. To add a backend pool, you need network contributor role on the LB and on the VMs that will be part of the backend pool.\nFor this reason the network contributor role must be assigned to the RG where the LB and the VM resides. So the correct answer is Network Contributor on RG1.\n2. For Health Probe also, without having access to RG1, no health probe can be added. If only Network Contributor role is assigned to LB then the user would not be able to access the IP addresses of the member pools.\nOwner/Contributor can give the user access for everything. So it will not fit into the the principle of least privilege.

    "answer": "C",
    "answerDescription": "The virtual networks can be in the same or different regions, and from the same or different subscriptions. When connecting VNets from different subscriptions, the subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.<br>Configuring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a good way to easily connect VNets. Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet connection type (VNet2VNet) is similar to creating a Site-to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both function the same way when communicating.<br>The local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order to route traffic.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal",

IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied the communication, so that you can resolve the problem.<br>C: The NSG flow log capability allows you to log the source and destination IP address, port, protocol, and whether traffic was allowed or denied by an NSG.<br>D: The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview",

As a result, you might see flow log entries for flows from internet IP addresses, if the flow is destined to a port in the range of ports assigned for SNAT. While Azure won't allow these flows to the VM, the attempt is logged and appears in Network Watcher's NSG flow log by design. We recommend that unwanted inbound internet traffic be explicitly blocked with NSG."
