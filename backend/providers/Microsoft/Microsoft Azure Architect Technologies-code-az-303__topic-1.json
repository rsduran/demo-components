If the requests are pushed within seconds apart it can't determine duplicates. Because the minimum duplicate identification window is 20 seconds.\n\nEnabling duplicate detection and the size of the window directly impact the queue (and topic) throughput, since all recorded message-ids must be matched against the newly submitted message identifier.\n\nKeeping the window small means that fewer message-ids must be retained and matched, and throughput is impacted less. For high throughput entities that require duplicate detection, you should keep the window as small as possible. Hope that clears why the answer is correct."

This allows you to re-distribute your data to match the desired new partition key scheme, and make the relevant application changes afterwards, thus achieving the effect of \u201cupdating your partition key\u201d.\nYou will need to have access to an Azure subscription, and an Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account that will be used for the migration metadata (this can be the same as the collection where you wish to change partition key scheme, if you wish).\nThe deployment uses Azure Resource Manager (ARM) to deploy two app service plans. One is for a client node.js application, and the other is to handle the migration workload and Change Feed processing."
