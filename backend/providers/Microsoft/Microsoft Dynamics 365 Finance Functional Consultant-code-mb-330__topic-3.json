Technically you could create a movement journal to hold items *if* it has storage dimension \"inventory status.\" You could literally just create a movement for all on-hand quantities of the item, and change nothing but the inventory status from (for example) \"available\" to \"blocked.\"\n3. I still don't understand what exactly the difference is between stopping an item via the default order settings vs. stopping an item via manual inventory blocking. \n4. E.g., if I stop the item via the DOS (inventory / sales / purchase) is the effect identical to if I were to block the inventory via inventory blocking?"

The company is experiencing a rapid expansion not only in its supplements but as a lifestyle brand that also sells apparel. The supplements and apparel businesses operate independently but manufacture and operate in the same legal entity.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br>Current environment. Technology<br><br>Trey Research is migrating from an outdated, on-premises version of Dynamics AX to Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. The company wants to retain a lot of its current data structures and processes but adopt new efficiencies when the benefit is obvious. The company uses a third-party e-commerce site that is custom developed by an internal developer.<br><br><br>Current environment. Items<br> -<br><br><br>Product numbering <br> -<br><br>All items are numbered by using a smart numbering format: [Product SKU+Size+Color+Style]. For reporting, items are queried for sales and inventory reports by using the first six digits of the item number or until the first dash is encountered. <br><br>\u2022 A t-shirt could be 01001-S-Red for item 1001 in a size small with the color red. <br>\u2022 A single energy drink could be 02001-12oz or 02001-20oz for the different sizes that product 02001 is sold in. <br><br><br>Product attributes <br> -<br><br>\u2022 All clothing shares the same set of product attributes. <br>\u2022 Supplements may share the same Product SKU but can have different attributes for the different size, color, or style variations of the product. <br>\u2022 Product attributes that are unnecessary for an item should be excluded from the item. <br><br><br>Pricing <br> -<br><br>\u2022 All items always have a default price. This price will not expire. <br>\u2022 An item will have four different prices created for it every month, one for each customer tier, as detailed later in this section. The pricing expires at the end of the month. If no special pricing is created, the default item price will be used. <br>\u2022 The monthly sales price in which the additional price breaks are determined is based on the estimated cost of the manufactured items. <br>\u2022 Customers are categorized into four pricing tiers (A, B, C, and D) based on sales volume over the past 12 months. <br>\u2022 Customers can negotiate special pricing for items in 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day increments. Quantity restrictions may be placed, depending on the item discount and promotion. <br>\u2022 Promotional pricing is not used today. Pricing is restricted to monthly prices and customer-specific contract pricing. <br><br><br>Cost <br> -<br><br>Items use a FIFO costing model today in their current Dynamics AX 2009 environment; however, using the FIFO costing method has created problems.<br><br>Current environment. Warehouse and inventory<br><br>\u2022 Warehouse requirements are simplistic. There is only one site. The site has two warehouses. <br>\u2022 Trey Research needs to make sure that any energy drinks and nutritional supplements are manufactured and packaged with the highest standards. Trey Research automatically inspects products when all products are reported as finished. All products are inspected again when the items are picked. <br>\u2022 Energy drinks require independent tests to check for dents in packaging, carbonation levels, and fill level. <br>\u2022 Nutritional supplements require separate tests for packaging, expiration date, product seal, and product labeling. <br>\u2022 Government compliancy and consistency testing are handled outside of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. <br>\u2022 Resalable products are placed on one of two racks in the warehouse.<br><br><br>Requirements <br> -<br><br><br>Requirements. Technology<br> -<br><br>\u2022 Trey Research will integrate all pricing and discount capabilities to its e-commerce website.<br><br><br>Requirements. Items<br> -<br><br>\u2022 Reporting on products should be streamlined as much as possible. <br>\u2022 The item numbering does not have to equate to the actual item number. <br>\u2022 The future costing methods adopted must be commonly accepted for manufacturers. <br>\u2022 Inventory costing should be done after a full inventory valuation is complete. It should take into consideration the direct materials, direct labor, and overhead that goes into an item. <br>\u2022 Any costing method used needs the ability to track cost records about an item, cost categories, and calculation formulas for indirect costs. <br>\u2022 The profitability for nutritional supplements manufacturing processes needs to be expressed in terms of the cost categories for routing operations and the calculation formulas for manufacturing overheads. <br>\u2022 If a vendor can no longer deliver the raw materials for the energy drinks due to supply chain issues, the costs for using an alternative vendor to source the raw materials should be used to determine the impact on profits. <br>\u2022 Apparel items will not be upgraded to the new costing method until after the go-live date due to resourcing and implementation limitations from the apparel team.<br><br><br>Requirements. Pricing <br> -<br><br>\u2022 Trey Research plans to do promotional pricing. Certain products will receive special pricing during the hours of extreme sporting events that Trey Research sponsors. Before or after the event, normal pricing will resume.<br><br><br>Requirements. White labeling <br> -<br><br>\u2022 Trey Research wants to start white labeling its products under the brands of major nutritional retail store brands. These products would only be sold to specific customers. <br>\u2022 Trey Research will provide and maintain a 'Compare to' price for customers to use to compare the white-labeled products. This Compare to price will also be the default item price for the customer if the customer accidentally lets a contract price expire. <br>\u2022 The configuration of these restrictions must be applied automatically when creating new products for those customers.<br><br>Requirements. Warehouse and inventory <br><br>\u2022 If products in the warehouse must be blocked from transactions for a specific reason, such as a health and safety review, warehouse users should be able to block the products quickly from the ERP system. <br>\u2022 All product quality tests should be processed in a uniform and consistent manner. <br>\u2022 Creation of any quality processes for products inbound to the warehouse, from the production line, or outbound from the warehouse to consumers should be automatically created to facilitate execution. <br>\u2022 Testing requirements:<br>\u25e6 Requirement 1: 100 percent of all nutritional supplements and 50 percent of all energy drinks must be tested when production orders are completed. After a product is in testing, 100 percent of all tests must be completed. <br>\u25e6 Requirement 2: 75 percent of all nutritional supplements and energy drinks should be tested against their required tests during an outbound process. <br>\u25e6 Damaged products must be placed in one of four bins (based on product type) during the inspection process. <br>\u25e6 You must define quarantine zones to optimize product visibility throughout the testing process.<br><br><br>You need to configure quality controls.<br><br>Which solution objects should you configure?

Coho Vineyard is based in Medford, Oregon. The vineyard grows the grapes and then produces and bottles the wine. Coho Winery, based in Grants Pass, Oregon, distributes packaged wine to businesses and consumers. The winery sells imported cheese and olive oil in addition to the wines.<br><br>Current environment. Technology landscape<br><br>\u2022\tCoho Vineyard &amp; Winery requires financial reporting from both Coho Vineyard and Coho Winery. The parent company consolidates financials in a third-party tool.<br>\u2022\tCoho Winery currently manages inventory and financials on spreadsheets separately from the parent company.<br><br>Current environment. Inventory and warehousing<br><br>\u2022\tThe entire warehouse is temperature controlled. A refrigerated section of the warehouse is used for items that require colder storage.<br>\u2022\tThe items do not have fixed locations in the warehouse.<br>\u2022\tCoho uses smart numbering for cheese items today. The items start with F for France and U for United States such as the following:<br>\u2022\tF11234 = French cheese<br>\u2022\tU14567 = US cheese<br>\u2022\tCurrently, wine does not use smart numbering.<br>\u2022\tInventory is valued at First In, First-Out (FIFO).<br>\u2022\tOlive oil has a 12-month shelf life.<br>\u2022\tWineA is expensive and not regularly stocked in the warehouse.<br>\u2022\tWineB must be in the refrigerated section of the warehouse.<br>\u2022\tWineC is non-refrigerated wine and is the majority of inventory in the warehouse.<br><br>Current environment. Vendors and procurement<br><br>\u2022\tCheese is purchased from vendors in two countries: France and United States.<br>\u2022\tNon-cheese items can be purchased from vendors in other countries or regions.<br>\u2022\tOlive oil is bought and sold in full cases of six each.<br>\u2022\tWhen Coho Vineyard produces more wine than expected in a season, rebate programs are offered to any company whose monthly purchases exceed $5,000.<br><br><br>Requirements. General -<br><br>\u2022\tThe Coho Vineyard &amp; Winery parent company, as well as Coho Vineyard, will not be considered in the implementation of Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management for Coho Winery. They plan to implement them as separate legal entities in the next five years.<br><br>Requirements. Inventory and warehousing<br><br>\u2022\tItems must be renumbered in the new system.<br>\u2022\tSeparate item numbers must be used for each imported item for use in simplified reporting by source country or region.<br>\u2022\tAdvanced Warehouse Management capabilities must be enabled in the new system.<br>\u2022\tEach bottle of wine has a single item number.<br>\u2022\tThe vintage of each bottle will change annually and may affect the cost of the bottle. This cost must be tracked by year.<br>\u2022\tSome bottles of wine require refrigeration. The system must automatically define where items must be stored in the warehouse.<br>\u2022\tWine must be grouped in a hierarchy such as the following:<br>\u2022\tRed<br>\u2022\tCabernet<br>\u2022\tMerlot<br>\u2022\tWhite<br>\u2022\tChardonnay<br>\u2022\tPinot<br>\u2022\tInventory value must be stored at each month end.<br>\u2022\tEach month, the olive oil on-hand inventory is evaluated. Anything with less than six months left on the shelf life is sold to a discount retail store. If less than 90 days remains for the shelf life, then the olive oil is donated or destroyed.<br>\u2022\tAt least 20 cases of olive oil and no more than 50 cases are on hand and not reserved for upcoming customer orders.<br>\u2022\tWineB must be refrigerated.<br><br>Requirements. Vendors and procurement<br><br>\u2022\tThe cheese smart numbering system will not be used in the future. Instead, the system must use standard configurations to ensure the correct cheese items are used for the correct country or region when ordering.<br>\u2022\tOlive oil must be managed in full cases only, although the inventory cost must be calculated as cages.<br>\u2022\tShould any bottle of olive oil be broken within a case, the cases will be sold at a discounted price.<br>\u2022\tVendor rebates must be calculated and submitted for a claim.<br>\u2022\tRebate programs are passed on to the retailers selling Coho Winery wines. The rebates must be claimed from Coho Vineyard.<br>\u2022\tPurchase orders (POs) must be maintained online with tracked changes between the vendors and the buyers.<br>\u2022\tThe controller decides WineA must not be held in financial inventory on the Coho Winery books. The winery makes an agreement with the vendor that WineA will be owned by the vendor until a later date.<br>\u2022\tVendor1 sends bulk shipments. Coho Winery does not always have enough warehouse staff to receive inventory. The company requires Vendor1 to send advanced shipping notices (ASNs).<br>\u2022\tThe operations coordinator must schedule inbound loads. The company requires automation of inbound load creation where possible.<br><br><br>Issues -<br><br>\u2022\tThe warehouse is at maximum capacity. Empty bin locations are not always available.<br>\u2022\tThe warehouse manager wants to establish fast moving locations for WineB on the floor and refill locations from higher rack storage.<br>\u2022\tCoho Winery recently conducted an internal audit risk assessment. The risk assessment found that inventory value reports were stored in spreadsheets. The spreadsheets can easily be edited and lack controls.<br>\u2022\tAfter olive oil is counted, multiple cases are destroyed due to shelf life. The inventory planner must determine if a new PO should be placed for olive oil.<br>\u2022\tThe vendor rebates claims are often rejected because the claims were miscalculated by not including discounts.<br>\u2022\tThe purchasing manager receives multiple complaints regarding POs:<br>\u2022\tIssue 1: PO changes are not accepted and confirmed, resulting in out-of-stock issues.<br>\u2022\tIssue 2: Vendors do not have control on responses to POs. Instead, the vendors rely on emails.<br><br><br>You need to resolve the risk issue identified from the internal audit.<br><br>What should you configure?",
