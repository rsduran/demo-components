It seems there might be a discrepancy between the information provided in the question and the answer. If the question does not specify that the file shares and virtual machines (VMs) are located in multiple regions, but the answer indicates that you should create a Recovery Services vault for each region due to the presence of data sources in West US, East US, and Central US, then it\u2019s possible that part of the question is missing or implied.\n\nIn practice, it\u2019s important to have all the necessary information to make an informed decision about the configuration of Recovery Services vaults. Azure best practices recommend creating a Recovery Services vault in each region where your data sources are located to ensure compliance with data residency regulations and to optimize for network latency."
