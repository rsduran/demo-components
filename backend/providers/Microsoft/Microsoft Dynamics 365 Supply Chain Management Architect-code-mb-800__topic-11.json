Turn on Expected Cost Posting\n\n\nTurning on Expected Cost Posting is the appropriate action to meet the requirements for received items because it addresses Issue 2 mentioned in the scenario.\n\nIssue 2 states that the accounting team uses a complex manual accrual process to determine the accounting impact of items received but not invoiced. The company wants to streamline the item accrual process. By enabling Expected Cost Posting, the system will automatically post expected costs to the general ledger when items are received, even if the invoice has not been received yet.\n\nThis feature helps the accounting team by simplifying the accrual process, making it more efficient and less time-consuming, and reducing the need for manual intervention. It also provides more accurate and up-to-date financial data, which is essential for effective decision-making and management of the company's resources."

Configure an Over-Receipt code with Tolerance percentage.\n\nConfiguring an Over-Receipt code with a Tolerance percentage is the appropriate action to address Issue 3 in the scenario.\n\nIssue 3 states that the company often receives a higher quantity of produce items than what they order because vendors allow for spoilage or damage of produce in transit. The company does not want to allow over receipt on non-produce items.\n\nBy configuring an Over-Receipt code with a Tolerance percentage, you can specify the acceptable over-receipt percentage for produce items in the system. This allows the company to account for the higher quantities of produce items received, while also maintaining control and preventing over receipt on non-produce items.\n\nThis configuration ensures that the company can accurately track and manage the receipt of produce items, while also maintaining the desired level of control for non-produce items in the inventory process."
