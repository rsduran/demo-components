However, it is recommended to do so for better performance and lower latency. According to the Azure Key Vault Overview1, you can use a key vault that is in the same region and tenant as the VMs to be encrypted. However, this is not a strict requirement, as the article also states that you can use a key vault that is in a different region or tenant, but you need to grant permissions to the VMs to access the key vault. The article also mentions that the contents of your key vault are replicated within the region and to a secondary region at least 150 miles away, but within the same geography to maintain high durability of your keys and secrets2. Therefore, using a key vault in the same region as your VMs can help you avoid cross-region network traffic and potential network failures."

Explanation below.\n\n\"If you create a private endpoint for the Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage resource, then you should also create one for the Blob Storage resource. That's because operations that target the Data Lake Storage Gen2 endpoint might be redirected to the Blob endpoint. Similarly, if you add a private endpoint for Blob Storage only, and not for Data Lake Storage Gen2, some operations (such as Manage ACL, Create Directory, Delete Directory, etc.) will fail since the Gen2 APIs require a DFS private endpoint. By creating a private endpoint for both resources, you ensure that all operations can complete successfully.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-private-endpoints"
