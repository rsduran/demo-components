In the context of NPS, a RADIUS client is typically a network access server such as a VPN server, wireless access point, or switch.\n\nWhen you add a new network access server (like a VPN server) to your network, you add the server as a RADIUS client in NPS, and then configure the RADIUS client to communicate with the NPS1. This does not mean that each individual VPN connection needs its own RADIUS client. Instead, the VPN server itself acts as the RADIUS client for all VPN connections it handles.\n\nHowever, if you have multiple VPN servers (NAS), each server would be configured as a separate RADIUS client in NPS. THERE ARE 8 NAS SERVERS WHICH REQUIRE TO BE CONFIGURED AS A RADIUS CLIENT."

By using Group Policy Objects (GPOs), you can apply inbound firewall rules to multiple servers at once, regardless of their operating system version. This makes it a more efficient choice compared to the other options.\n\nPlease note that while PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) and Microsoft Intune configuration profiles can also be used to manage settings, they might require more administrative effort compared to GPOs. Local security objects, on the other hand, would need to be configured individually on each server, which could be time-consuming. Therefore, GPOs would be the most efficient choice in this scenario."
