Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS. You can have as many caches as you need across the world.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/file-sync/file-sync-deployment-guide",

It extends on-premises systems into Azure storage while maintaining a local cache of the data on-premises."

It allows you to read and write data (with automatic failover) in the region closest to the users, providing both low latency and high availability. This meets the requirements of App1, as it ensures that data written by any instance is visible to all instances regardless of the region. \n\nAzure Data Lake and Azure Storage with GZRS do not natively support this type of active-active data replication across multiple regions."
