Regression suite automation tool (RSAT).\n\nRSAT is a tool that allows you to record business tasks using Task Recorder and then convert them into a suite of automated tests, without having to write source code. RSAT is fully integrated with Azure DevOps for test execution, reporting, and investigation. You can use RSAT to analyze test results generated by the development team and compare them with the expected outcomes.\n\nTrace parser is a tool that helps you analyze performance issues and identify the root causes of slow-running code. Task Recorder is a tool that helps you create documentation and training materials by recording business processes. SysTest is a framework that helps you author unit and component test code in Visual Studio. These tools are not designed for analyzing test results generated by the development team.\n\""
