Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<br>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<br>You are using Azure Machine Learning to run an experiment that trains a classification model.<br>You want to use Hyperdrive to find parameters that optimize the AUC metric for the model. You configure a HyperDriveConfig for the experiment by running the following code:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04274/0014700001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>You plan to use this configuration to run a script that trains a random forest model and then tests it with validation data. The label values for the validation data are stored in a variable named y_test variable, and the predicted probabilities from the model are stored in a variable named y_predicted.<br>You need to add logging to the script to allow Hyperdrive to optimize hyperparameters for the AUC metric.<br>Solution: Run the following code:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04274/0014700002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Does the solution meet the goal?<br>",

The cross-validation process will then run 10 iterations, where each iteration uses 9 folds for training and 1 fold for validation. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\n\nIt's worth noting that the choice of k can depend on factors such as the size of the dataset, the available computational resources, and the specific requirements of the task at hand. However, a value of k=10 is often considered a good starting point and is commonly used in practice for cross-validation.\n\nTherefore, option B (k = 10) is the appropriate value to configure the k parameter for the cross-validation in this classification task."

Similarly, a model with low bias can have high variance, but still be accurate. This is known as the bias-variance tradeoff."

Both Grid sampling and Random sampling can be used for configuring the sampling method for the Hyperdrive experiment.\n\nGrid sampling will allow you to define a search space with different combinations of hyperparameters, and it will train the model with every possible combination of hyperparameters. This approach works well when the search space is relatively small.\n\nRandom sampling will randomly sample hyperparameters from the defined search space. This method can cover a larger search space more efficiently than grid sampling, and it can be useful when there are a large number of hyperparameters to tune.\n\nBayesian sampling is not an option in this case, as it requires an early termination policy to be applied in order to determine which hyperparameters to explore next based on the results of previous runs. Since an early termination policy is not allowed in this scenario, Bayesian sampling is not a viable option"

    "answerDescription": "Maximum number of runs on random grid: This option also controls the number of iterations over a random sampling of parameter values, but the values are not generated randomly from the specified range; instead, a matrix is created of all possible combinations of parameter values and a random sampling is taken over the matrix. This method is more efficient and less prone to regional oversampling or undersampling.<br>If you are training a model that supports an integrated parameter sweep, you can also set a range of seed values to use and iterate over the random seeds as well. This is optional, but can be useful for avoiding bias introduced by seed selection.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: If you are building a clustering model, use Sweep Clustering to automatically determine the optimum number of clusters and other parameters.<br>C: Entire grid: When you select this option, the module loops over a grid predefined by the system, to try different combinations and identify the best learner. This option is useful for cases where you don't know what the best parameter settings might be and want to try all possible combination of values.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/tune-model-hyperparameters",

To meet the requirement of iterating all possible combinations of hyperparameters while minimizing computing resources, you should use the \u201cEntire grid\u201d parameter sweep mode in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

While this can be computationally expensive, it ensures that all combinations are tried and can result in finding the best combination of hyperparameters for your model. To minimize computing resources, you can carefully choose the range and granularity of the hyperparameters to be swept, and use parallel processing to speed up the sweep"

In this case, the compute target must support distributed processing, which is required for the ParallelRunStep. The AmlCompute class is the only class listed that provides this capability.\n\nBatchCompute is not a valid compute target class in the azureml.core.compute package. Instead, it is a service provided by Azure that enables you to run large-scale, high-performance batch jobs.\n\nAdlaCompute is a compute target class in the azureml.core.compute package, but it is not designed for distributed processing.

The utility of the output is typically assessed by comparing it to the non-private output and measuring the difference between the two. The goal is to ensure that the difference is not too large, so that the output of the differentially private query is still useful.\n\nIn this case, measuring the distribution of reports for repeated queries is a way to check the utility of the differentially private query, as it will help you ensure that the output is balanced and not biased towards a particular result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.

By selecting an appropriate threshold, you can balance the trade-off between false positives and false negatives, thereby mitigating unfairness in predictions across sensitive features.\n\nIn this case, since the question specifically mentions unfair predictions across sensitive features, we can infer that the problem involves binary classification (predicting two classes) rather than regression (predicting continuous values) or time series forecasting (predicting future values over time)."

The value of epsilon is used to control the amount of noise added to the data to maintain privacy.\n\nWhen you perform multiple queries against the dataset, each one \"uses\" a part of this privacy budget. In order to maintain an appropriate level of overall privacy, you should consider that each separate query could potentially leak some information. Therefore, the cumulative privacy loss or total epsilon should be the sum of the epsilons for each query, not the smallest or largest single value.\nIf you were to set the total epsilon to the smallest of the two values, you would be assuming that only one of the queries contributes to privacy loss, which is not the case."

Chatgpt -When setting up automated machine learning training for an image classification model in your Azure Machine Learning workspace, the primary metric you should choose for optimizing model training is accuracy for binary and multi-class classification models and IoU (Intersection over Union) for multilabel classification models1. These metrics are essential for evaluating the performance of your trained models and ensuring their effectiveness in classifying images accurately."
