Putting 2 databases in an elastic pool is typically counterproductive cost-wise, but since the question is only about downtime, both A and D have similar latency in scaling. SQL MI can scale also, but not as fast as Azure SQL DB.  Finally, Azure SQL DB using serverless (no elastic pool) can be considered since we don't know the workload.  \n\nStaying within the same service level (standard to standard or gp to gp) will be the fastest for 100GB databases, as data is not copied and detached/attached. Moving between tiers is quite a bit slower (gp -&gt; bc).  Here, hyperscale offers the all around fastest rescale time, so even though you don't *need* hyperscale for size, the only thing being asked is, \"which scales fastest?\"  Since hyperscale is a service tier of Azure SQL DB, I think D is correct as it offers the most options. \n\nRefer to latency chart:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/elastic-pool-scale"

If Azure Service Fabric determines that a failover needs to occur, the failover will be similar to that of a failover cluster instance (FCI). The service fabric will look for a node with spare capacity and spin up a new SQL Server instance. The database files will then be attached, recovery will be run, and gateways will be updated to point applications to the new node. No virtual network or listener or updates are required. This capability is built in.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-sql-high-availability/4-high-availability-architecture\n\nActive geo-replication is an Azure SQL Database feature that allows you to create readable secondary databases of individual databases on a server in the same or different data center (region).\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/active-geo-replication-overview"

The secondary replicas are provisioned with the same compute size as the primary replica. The read scale-out feature allows you to offload read-only workloads using the compute capacity of one of the read-only replicas, instead of running them on the read-write replica. This way, some read-only workloads can be isolated from the read-write workloads, and will not affect their performance. The feature is intended for the applications that include logically separated read-only workloads, such as analytics. In the Premium and Business Critical service tiers, applications could gain performance benefits using this additional capacity at no extra cost.\n\nAnswer is B\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/read-scale-out"

This backup will be the yearly backup, and it will be retained for 10 years.<br>Note: Long-term backup retention (LTR) leverages the full database backups that are automatically created to enable point in time restore (PITR). If an LTR policy is configured, these backups are copied to different blobs for long-term storage. The copy is a background job that has no performance impact on the database workload. The LTR policy for each database in SQL Database can also specify how frequently the LTR backups are created.<br>To enable LTR, you can define a policy using a combination of four parameters: weekly backup retention (W), monthly backup retention (M), yearly backup retention (Y), and week of year (WeekOfYear). If you specify W, one backup every week will be copied to the long-term storage. If you specify M, the first backup of each month will be copied to the long-term storage. If you specify Y, one backup during the week specified by WeekOfYear will be copied to the long-term storage. If the specified WeekOfYear is in the past when the policy is configured, the first LTR backup will be created in the following year. Each backup will be kept in the long-term storage according to the policy parameters that are configured when the LTR backup is created.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/long-term-retention-overview?view=azuresql",
