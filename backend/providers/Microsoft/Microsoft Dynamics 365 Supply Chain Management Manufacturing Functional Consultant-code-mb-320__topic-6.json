The settings that you define allow you to complete the following tasks:\n\nControl the scheduling direction (for example, forward or backward schedule from a date).\nSchedule productions based on the capacity of the resources (finite capacity).\nUse capabilities in resource requirements in the route.\nSchedule resources exclusively.\nSchedule productions based on material availability (material optimization).\nSchedule subproductions."
