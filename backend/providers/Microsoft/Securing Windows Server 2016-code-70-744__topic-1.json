Cipher creates the files based on the logged in user.  We need the user cert, not the administrator cert, thus log in as user first and run cipher.  Then since the task is to make the user a domain recovery agent, log in as administrator and use the CER file (group policy asks for the CER file to add the agent, not the pfx file) so use the CER file to add the agent in group policy.\n\nFurther explanation...  Certutil and .PFX may be used if a user wants to give his recovery key to another user, but this is not used for domain agents. (I didn't lab this out, this is jut my educated guess)"

No need for the Install-ADDS cmd. Seems that only gets used possibly later if you're setting up a new DNS server in the production forest, but that isn't absolutely necessary as an existing DNS server can be used. The Install-module choice might be correct instead (would be first cmd) - if you were configuring the HGS server from a remote workstation you'd need to use this to get the HGS powershell tools before you could do anything else. Don't know which is \"best answer\" as per MSFT."

Instead of using NewPAMTrust, you can perform these three tasks individually\nwith the following commands using the netdom tool:\n\nnetdom trust production.local /domain:bastion.local\n/userO:production\\\nadministrator /passwordO:password /add\nnetdom trust production.local /domain:bastion.local\n/EnableSIDHistory:yes /\nuserO:production\\administrator /passwordO:password\nnetdom trust production.local /domain:bastion.local\n/Quarantine:no /\nuserO:production\\administrator /passwordO:password\n\nYou do have to enable SID History, and New-PAMTrust will do that for you.
