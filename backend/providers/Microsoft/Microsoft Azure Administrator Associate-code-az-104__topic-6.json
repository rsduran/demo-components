If not, then I don't really care if the CPU peaks 100% and it would be better to have constant usage, let's say in the 50-60% on average with the occasional 100% spikes than just keeping the CPU almost idle for the majority of the time.

Since the daily backups retain data for 14 days, there should be a backup available from around eight days ago.\n\n    Minimize Downtime: Choosing the \"Replace existing\" option ensures that the restored VM1 will replace the current VM1 instance, minimizing downtime. This option replaces the entire VM with the backup version, including its disks, configuration, and data. It's typically faster than creating a new VM and copying data back.\n\nTherefore, the first step would be to initiate the restore operation and choose the \"Replace existing\" option to restore VM1 to the desired point in time while minimizing downtime."

If you go on portal and goto Disks and select a VM and then create a new disk, it will ask you to select an existing resource group or create a new rg (usually we create the disk in the same rg as of vm which is RG1 here). This means that after creating the disk, the resource group will be updated, and it will have an operation occur on it. Once created, we then attach the new disk to VM1, which means VM1 is also affected now by the disk attach operation. So for User 1, Alert 1 and Alert2 both will be triggered because Alert1 has scope of RG1 and Alert 2 has scope of VM1.\n\nUser 2 operations:\nThis one is straightforward. User 2 assigns new tags to both RG1 and VM1. Thus write operations will be logged for both VM1 and RG1. Therefore, Alert1 and Alert2 both will be triggered."

This can be configured to automatically copy data from one storage location to another, either within the same region or across different regions. Object replication can be used to create disaster recovery solutions or to distribute data globally for better performance and availability.\nIt is similar to GRS but it is more flexible as you can choose the storage account and container to replicate the data.\nThe GRS of a North Europe region is a secondary copy of the data stored in a different region. The exact location of the secondary region will depend on the specific Azure region you have selected. For the North Europe region, the secondary copy is stored in the West Europe region. This means that if there is an outage or disaster in the North Europe region, your data will still be available in the West Europe region.

It provides redundancy by maintaining multiple copies of your data across different data centers. If a failure occurs in the primary region, the secondary region ensures data availability without manual intervention. GRS is a robust solution for disaster recovery and data durability.\nMinimized Administrative Effort: With GRS, you don\u2019t need to manually manage the replication process or set up additional configurations. Azure handles the replication transparently, reducing administrative overhead.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. geo-redundant storage (GRS). Configure GRS for your storage account, and Azure will take care of maintaining the secondary copy in the East US region."

In this scenario, you need to create an alert rule that will run App1 if VM1 stops, and for this purpose, you need to create an action group. An action group defines the set of actions to be taken when an alert is triggered, such as running an Azure function, sending an email, or creating an Azure ticket.\n\nBy creating an action group and associating it with the alert rule, you can automate the process of running App1 if VM1 stops, without the need for manual intervention. This helps ensure that critical systems, such as App1, are automatically activated when necessary, improving the overall reliability and availability of your Azure services."

Network scenarios are complex, they're implemented using network security groups, firewalls, user-defined routes, and resources provided by Azure. Complex configurations make troubleshooting connectivity issues challenging. Network Watcher helps reduce the amount of time to find and detect connectivity issues. The results returned can provide insights into whether a connectivity issue is due to a platform or a user configuration issue. Connectivity can be checked with PowerShell, Azure CLI, and REST API."

Sure, on a policy level nothing is stopping you from reaching the other storage account over the internet, but on a network level there is.\n\n\"Service Endpoint\" is just a fancy way of calling a network route that uses another gateway other than the default and redirects all the traffic for the service (in this case Azure Storage) over the MS internal network. As anyone familiar with their routing knows, if you add another route, as long as the traffic meets the criteria it will go through that route, the default route 0.0.0.0/0 will be used when there are no other routes available.\n\nIn this case there is another route available, which is the one that goes over the Service Endpoint, so every and all traffic for Azure Storage will use that route and won't even consider touching the default route which goes over the internet. If you have that all your traffic is forced to pass through a single point, then can easily block whatever you want with a policy, or a firewall rule, or a proxy or whatever other means you have to do so."
