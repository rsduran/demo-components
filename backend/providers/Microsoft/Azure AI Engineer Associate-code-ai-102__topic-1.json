Then, it applies a second layer of encryption using the customer-managed keys (this is the secondary encryption). This double encryption process increases the size of the index because it adds additional metadata and requires more storage space to accommodate the encrypted data."

Speech\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/overview-identity#face-detection-and-analysis\nFace detection is required as a first step in all the other scenarios. The Detect API detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. It also returns a unique ID that represents the stored face data. This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses."

However, this question later comes with the option of increase the replicas: \nA simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing-based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it's important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all. Investigating the conditions that cause throttling will be explained in the next several sections."

Higher tiers provide more resources such as increased document counts, indexing speed, and query capacity. If the query volume has increased and requests are being throttled, it indicates that the current tier\u2019s resources are insufficient to handle the load.

However, you can allocate up to 12 replicas in a Standard search service and 3 replicas in a Basic search service.

        "content": "The correct answer is B. No.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nAdding replicas does not directly address the issue of query throttling in Azure Cognitive Search.\nQuery throttling occurs when the service limits the number of requests it can handle within a given time frame. It is typically related to the service\u2019s capacity, rate limits, and resource availability.\nTo reduce the likelihood of query throttling, consider other factors such as:\nService capacity: Ensure that your service tier (including replicas and partitions) can handle the query volume.\nOptimize query design: Efficiently structure your queries to minimize resource usage.\nIndex composition: Smaller indexes tend to perform better, but also consider schema complexity and field attribution.\nTherefore, adding replicas alone does not meet the goal of reducing query throttling. You need to address other aspects of your search service to achieve better performance and avoid throttling"

Throttling can occur during queries or indexing. From the client side, an API call results in a 503 HTTP response when it has been throttled. During indexing, there's also the possibility of receiving a 207 HTTP response, which indicates that one or more items failed to index. This error is an indicator that the search service is getting close to capacity.\n\nA simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing-based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it's important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all. Investigating the conditions that cause throttling will be explained in the next several sections."

The Detect API detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. It also returns a unique ID that represents the stored face data. This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses."

Use Azure roles\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/service-create-private-endpoint#why-use-a-private-endpoint-for-secure-access\nPrivate Endpoints for Azure Cognitive Search allow a client on a virtual network to securely access data in a search index over a Private Link. The private endpoint uses an IP address from the virtual network address space for your search service. Network traffic between the client and the search service traverses over the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-rbac?tabs=config-svc-portal%2Croles-portal%2Ctest-portal%2Ccustom-role-portal%2Cdisable-keys-portal#grant-access-to-a-single-index\nIn some scenarios, you may want to limit application's access to a single resource, such as an index.\n\nThe portal doesn't currently support role assignments at this level of granularity, but it can be done with PowerShell or the Azure CLI."

While they are easy to manage and distribute, they do not offer the granularity to limit access to specific queries or parts of the index.\nAzure Roles (RBAC) - Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to define roles and permissions at a more granular level. You can create custom roles that limit access to specific operations or data within the index. This can be particularly useful if you need to restrict certain applications to only access specific queries or subsets of data."

For example, if you have a capacity of 1, this equals 1,000 TPM, and the rate limit of requests you can make per minute (RPM) is calculated using a ratio. For every 1,000 TPM, you can make 6 RPM.\n\nSo, if you need to process 600 requests every minute, you'll require a TPM that supports that many RPM. Using the ratio, for 600 RPM, you need 100,000 TPM (because 600 divided by 6 equals 100, and 100 multiplied by 1,000 equals 100,000). In this scenario, you would set the capacity to 100, since each capacity unit equals 1,000 TPM."
