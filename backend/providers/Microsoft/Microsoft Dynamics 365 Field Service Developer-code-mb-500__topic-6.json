The user interface must be created to include the new columns and the data must be available to add to the grid. The form must have only an Action Pane, a Navigation List, a List Style Grid, a Details Header, and a Details Tab in the design and include the Load ID field.<br><br>Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm is currently in the process of adding the other required fields: one for Product Name and one for Batch ID. The new fields must be related to extended data types for the original fields on the existing data source for the Inventory Status form. Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm plans to add the EcoResProductName and Batch ID data to the extended table for WHSTmpStatusChange. The fields on the table extension must be populated with data and visible on the Inventory Status form on insert.<br><br><br>Issues -<br><br>\u2022\tThe internal development team has created the SFTP site connections, the staging table, and the batch jobs for the new integration for freight processing.
