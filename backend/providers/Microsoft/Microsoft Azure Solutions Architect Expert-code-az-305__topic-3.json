It can provide SSL termination and caching for faster performance.\n\nHowever, compared to the AKS ingress controller, Azure Front Door is a higher-level service that operates at the HTTP/HTTPS layer and is optimized for HTTP traffic. It is typically used for web applications that require advanced routing, traffic management, and SSL offloading.\n\nOn the other hand, the AKS ingress controller is a Kubernetes-native solution that operates at the layer 7 (HTTP) and layer 4 (TCP) level, and can provide more granular control over traffic routing and application-level routing rules.\n\nTherefore, the choice between Azure Front Door and AKS ingress controller ultimately depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the applications being deployed. For applications running on Kubernetes, using the AKS ingress controller is often the most straightforward and cost-effective option."
