From the Dell site you linked : dnscmd /ageallrecords &lt;zone&gt; : If scavenging is enabled on the server and the specified zone, this command will add a timestamp to all records in the zone (or a subtree of the zone) and set the value of the timestamp to the current time. This makes those records eligible to be scavenged, though they won't be scavenged right away; their no-refresh and refresh intervals have to expire first, as always. Be aware that this command affects static records (effectively turning them into dynamic records, as far as scavenging is concerned) and that once a timestamp is added to a record, the only way to remove it is to delete and recreate the record manually. Name server (NS), start-of-authority (SOA), and WINS records are not affected by this command.\nThis will not accomplish the required scavenging of records immediately - it will add a time-stamp to certain records and schedule them for deletion subject to requirements configured.\nThe technet article linked in answer would be more suitable as it is the Microsoft approach and Microsoft will draw from their own technet articles for the questions rather than Dell resources."

The route in the routing protocol that has the lowest administrative distance will be the best route .\n\nMetric: If a router learns two different routes for the same network with the \"same routing protocol\" , it must decide which route is better and will add it to the routing table .\n\nOrigin of the route\t-&gt; Administrative distance\nON-LINK -&gt; 0\n\nThe default route is used when the route is not matched by any other entry in the routing table.

If there is no default-route then the packets will be dropped \n\n172.16.0.0  is on-link -&gt;0 then the default route is not used\nSo in this case Server1 will attempt to connect directly to 172.20.10.50"

Comments from the 70-740 discussion:\nNetwork Controller is used with network virtualization. DCB enables QoS. \nQoS can help manage your network traffic by enabling you to configure rules that can detect\ncongestion or reduced bandwidth, and then  prioritize, or throttle, traffic accordingly. For example,\nyou can use QoS to prioritize voice and video traffic, which is sensitive to latency.\nDCB provides bandwidth allocation to specific network traffic and helps to improve Ethernet\ntransport reliability by using flow control based on priority. Because DCB is a hardware-based\nnetwork traffic management technology, when you use DCB. So, the correct answer is Data Center Bridging"

This is a Layer-3 routing approach to provide connectivity.\nImagine that you are having public IP address directly assigned to Hyper-V host with a /29 netmask, which gives you only 6 unicast IP addresses on the external\nnetwork but you have 1000 virtual machines on Hyper-V hosts. NAT on Hyper-V helps offering Internet connectivity while it does not required additional IP\naddresses on the external network.\nhttps://anandthearchitect.com/2018/01/06/windows-10-how-to-setup-nat-network-for-hyper-v-guests/\nhttp://techgenix.com/nat-network-hyper-v-vms/"

So C is not the answer. \n\n3) NAT is not classified as a \"Routing protocol\". NAT has no link or relation with Routing protocol. Its just a IP translator that fully rely on Interface. \n\nWhat i want to say is , after selecting NAT, next option is select the interface....So eveb if you want to add a routing protocol, you cant do that between selecting nat and add interface. There is no scope .... So considering these facts...i am making my answer as A .."

In the earlier example, eight types A records with the same name and different IP addresses cause a different answer to be prioritized to the top with each query. Because a new IP address is prioritized to the top with each query, clients are not repeatedly routed to the same server.\n\nThe initial release of Windows 2000 Server cannot natively use the netmask ordering feature and the round-robin feature at the same time. If the netmask ordering feature is turned on, the answers are always provided to the clients in the same order. In Windows Server 2003, this behavior changed to permit the use of both the subnet-based netmask ordering feature and the round-robin feature. The use of both the netmask ordering feature and the round-robin feature provides proximity awareness and load-balancing."

        "content": "Example &amp; Expl.\n\nIf your DNS server is running Windows Server Core, you can configure conditional forwarders on your DNS server from the command-line by using the DNSCMD command. A conditional forwarder is a forwarder that handles queries only for a specified domain name. Conditional forwarding enables a DNS server to forward queries for different domain names to different DNS servers according to the specific domain names that are contained in the queries. This improves conventional forwarding by adding a second condition to the forwarding process. To configure a conditional forwarder, you specify a domain and one or more IP addresses of DNS servers that can resolve queries directed to that domain.\n\nYou can use Dnscmd to configure conditional forwarders for your DNS server. For example, to configure a conditional forwarder that forwards all queries for hosts in the microsoft.com domain to the external DNS server 207.68.160.190, do the following:\n\ndnscmd SEA-SC4 /zoneadd microsoft.com /forwarder 207.68.160.190\n\nIf your DNS server is on a domain controller, use /dsforwarder instead of /forwarder in this command."

        "content": "If your DNS server is running Windows Server Core, you can configure forwarders on your DNS server from the command-line by using the DNSCMD command. A forwarder is a special DNS server that you designate for handling client requests that your regular DNS servers cannot or should not resolve, such as requests for offsite or external DNS domain names. DNS clients typically make recursive queries, which are queries to which the responding DNS server must return a valid (success or failure) response. When the DNS server receives a client request and if a forwarder is configured on the DNS server, the DNS server sends a recursive query to the forwarder asking for a valid response.\n\nYou can use the Dnscmd command to configure one or more forwarders on a Server Core DNS server. For example, to configure the external DNS server\n192.0.2.25 as a forwarder for DNS server SEA-SC4, do the following:\n\ndnscmd SEA-SC4 /ResetForwarders 192.0.2.25 /timeout 5 /slave"

In addition,\nsupport for DUID will be added to the IPv4 registration on the DHCP client.\nTherefore DHCID is a resource record stored in DNS like other RRs.\nThis RR is intended to be used by DHCP to store an identifier for a machine, along with other information for the name such as a machine\u2019s A/AAAA records.\nDHCID effectively provides a mapping to determine if a name has already been assigned, and if the address of the machine assigned to the name is the same as\nthe machine requesting registration with this name.\nDHCP\u2019s unique position in the name registration process allows it to request this match, and then refuse the registration of a machine with a different\naddress attempting to register a name with an existing DHCID record.\nPrevents the following name squatting situations:\n- Server name squatting by a client\n- Server name squatting by another server\n- Client name squatting by another client\n- Client name squatting by a server"

As you would imagine, they provide VMs located on these switches with access to the physical network the Hyper-V host is connected to. The External switch can also share management traffic as well as VM traffic on the same switch and this is one of the options that can be set when creating the external switch.\n\nInternal \u2013 This switch is not bound to a physical network card so it only allows traffic between VMs and the host itself. However, a new addition to the Internal switch functionality in 2016 is the addition of the NAT forwarding internal switch which does allow external connectivity via NAT from the Hyper-V host.\n\nPrivate \u2013 This type of switch is only used for virtual machines to communicate with each other. This type of switch might be useful for certain specific types of traffic such as cluster network if only using one host as it can\u2019t be utilized between hosts."

User2 already has NTFS full control, therefore Ans. C appears to me to be correct.\nAccess based enumeration is different than \"set explicit permissions\"  If you set explicit permissions, your choice is read, or deny.  that is all.  In my home lab, if you set explicit permissions to deny, it overrides NTFS permissions.  even full control.  Explicit permissions are not being used here.\nWhen using access based enumeration, you create folders within the DFS folder, and block folder inheritance.  That way you can set your own permissions, allowing access based enumeration to work.  if the user does not have NTFS permission, they cannot see the folder.  if they do, they can see it.  I hope this helps.  I was baffled when I saw this, but it seems more clear now.  The answer is C."
