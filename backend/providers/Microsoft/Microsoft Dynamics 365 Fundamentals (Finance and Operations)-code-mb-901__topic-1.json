In this case it needs to be \nRecord-based security\nYou can use record-based security to control user and team rights to do actions on individual records. This security applies to instances of entities (records) and is provided by access rights. The owner of a record can either share or grant access to a record to another user or team. Once they share or grant access, users must choose which rights they're granting. For example, the owner of an account record can grant read access to that account information, but not grant write access.\n\nAccess rights apply after user privileges. For example, if a user doesn't have the privileges to read account records, they'll be unable to view any account, whatever of the access rights another user might grant them through sharing."

A Sales person would get an access level of BASIC to see their own records only.\n\nBASIC = This access level gives a user access to records that the user owns, objects shared with the user, and objects shared with a team that the user is a member of. This level is the typical level of access for sales and service representatives. The application refers to this access level as user.\n\nLOCAL = This access level gives a user access to records in the user's business unit.
