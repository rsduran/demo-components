    "answerDescription": "The requirement states: Automate the configuration of the contractors' computers. The solution must provide a configuration file that the contractors can open from a Microsoft SharePoint site to apply the required configurations.<br>The 'configuration file' in this case is known as a 'provisioning package'.<br>A provisioning package (.ppkg) is a container for a collection of configuration settings. With Windows 10, you can create provisioning packages that let you quickly and efficiently configure a device without having to install a new image.<br>The tool for creating provisioning packages is renamed Windows Configuration Designer, replacing the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD) tool.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-install-icd https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-packages",
