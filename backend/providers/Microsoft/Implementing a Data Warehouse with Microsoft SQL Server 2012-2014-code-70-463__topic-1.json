So the\nDataflow and TRUNCATE SQL Task don\u2019t need to start their own\ntransaction, they only need to join the transaction started by the\npackage. So TRUNCATE + Dataflow should be in SUPPORTED Mode\n==&gt; 3rd Hint :: there is no specific information about managing the Logging SQL Task in case of fails which means that the logging task should be in NotSupported Mode.\n\nConclusion : The correct answer is :\nTransactionOption: Supported\nPrecedence Constraint: Success\nTransactionOption: Supported\nPrecedence Constraint: Completion\nTransactionOption: NotSupported"
