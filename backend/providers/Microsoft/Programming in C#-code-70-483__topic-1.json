New data is appended to the buffer if room is available; otherwise, a new, larger buffer is allocated, data from the original buffer is copied to the new buffer, and the new data is then appended to the new buffer.<br>The performance of a concatenation operation for a String or StringBuilder object depends on the frequency of memory allocations. A String concatenation operation always allocates memory, whereas a StringBuilder concatenation operation allocates memory only if the StringBuilder object buffer is too small to accommodate the new data. Use the String class if you are concatenating a fixed number of String objects. In that case, the compiler may even combine individual concatenation operations into a single operation. Use a StringBuilder object if you are concatenating an arbitrary number of strings; for example, if you're using a loop to concatenate a random number of strings of user input.<br>References: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder(v=vs.110).aspx",

The value of F is factored into the equation so that the result can be displayed in seconds.<br>Thus, the numerator represents the numbers of ticks counted during the last sample interval, F represents the frequency of the ticks, and the denominator represents the number of operations completed during the last sample interval.
