        "content": "Correct answer is Yes / No / No.\n\"In your Exchange organization, you may want to force all message delivery through a specific Active Directory site. You can use the Shell to designate an Active Directory site as a hub site. When you do this, you cause additional overall overhead because more servers are involved in message delivery. For example, consider a message that's sent from Site A to Site E. If the least-cost routing path is Site A-Site B-Site C-Site D-Site E, and you designate Site C as a hub site, the message is relayed from Site A to Site C and then relayed from Site C to Site E.\"\nSource : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/route-mail-between-active-directory-sites-exchange-2013-help"
