Two fault domains.\n\nExplanation: An availability set in Azure is a way to ensure high availability of applications by distributing them across multiple distinct physical servers called fault domains. Each fault domain shares a common underlying infrastructure, such as power and cooling, but is isolated from other fault domains. Thus, if an issue occurs in one of the fault domains, the other domains remain operational, ensuring the continuous availability of applications. In this case, by having two fault domains, the availability set will ensure that App1 remains available during planned maintenance of the hardware hosting VM1 and VM2."

General-purpose v2 accounts support default account access tiers of hot or cool and blob level tiering between hot, cool, or archive.\n\nUpgrading to a general-purpose v2 storage account from your general-purpose v1 or Blob storage accounts is straightforward. You can upgrade using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI. There is no downtime or risk of data loss associated with upgrading to a general-purpose v2 storage account.

So, when giving a prefix of Dep1/ it means that a vitrual folder gets created that blobs can get saved into. The question does not specify where the blobs get uploaded so I assume that they get uploaded to container1. Based on that, in order for rule1 to apply to any given blob, the blob would need to have a prefix of Dep1/. The first blob does not have said prefix, it's just that it's name starts with Dep1 which is different from the Dep1/ prefix that creates the folder. For the first question to be NO as everyone says, Dep1File1.txt blob would need to have a prefix of Dep1/ meaning, Dep1/Dep1File1.txt. Basically the only rule that applies here is rule2 and since every blob has a maximum modify date of 9 days we can access every blob. \n\nCorrect answer is YYY"

Azure Storage SSE uses Microsoft-managed encryption keys to encrypt the data in the storage account.\n\nIn the scenario described, you need to use a different key to encrypt data at rest for one of the containers. To do this, you need to create an encryption scope, which is a named configuration that defines the default encryption settings for a container. By creating an encryption scope, you can use a customer-managed key, stored in Azure Key Vault, to encrypt the data in that specific container.\n\nTherefore, option D (Create an encryption scope) is the correct answer as it allows you to use a different key for data encryption for the specific container."

The question clearly states:\n\"To which resources can User1 write by using SAS1 and key1?\"\nThis means that the RBAC for User1 will not apply. \nHence, when using the SAS1 this means that only Table services (i.e. \"Table1\") will be allowed, regardless of the RBAC.\n\n2. The signing key \"key1\", which is one of the two storage account access keys, are to be seen as the \"root password\" for the storage account.\nExhibit: \"Your storage account access keys are similar to a root password for your storage account.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string\n\nGo to your Storage Account and select the Access keys blade.
