For example, a dual processor system using quad core processors contains a total of 8 logical processors in the host system. On a system with this configuration, don't allocate more than a total of 16 virtual processors to all guest virtual machines combined.\"<br>Furthermore, the host operating system also needs 2 processors. source: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj619301(v=exchg.160).aspx<br><br>Host 1 uses 12 out of 20 cores -<br><br>Host 2 uses 20 out of 20 cores -<br><br>Host 3 uses 32 out of 20 cores -<br>You need 12 cores, so Host 3 lacks the resources.<br>This leaves hosts 1 and 2.<br>Now, let's look to the memory requirements:<br>\"\"\u00a6using dynamic memory or memory overcommit features for Exchange isn't supported.\" source: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj619301(v=exchg.160).aspx<br><br>Host 1 uses 20 out of 64 GB -<br><br>Host 2 uses 48 out of 64 GB -<br><br>Host 3 uses 44 out of 64 GB -<br>You need 24 GB for each VM.<br>Only host 1 has the resources for it.<br>It is not recommended to put both VM's on one host.<br>So, the answer should be: A.",

Mail-enabling a public folder allows users to post to the public folder by sending an email message to it. When a public folder is mail-enabled additional settings become available for the public folder in the Exchange admin center (EAC), such as email addresses and mail quotas. In the Exchange Management Shell, before a public folder is mail-enabled, you use the Set-PublicFolder cmdlet to manage all of its settings. After the public folder is mail-enabled, you use the Set-PublicFolder and the Set-MailPublicFolder cmdlets to manage the settings.\n\nIf you want users on the Internet to send mail to a mail-enabled public folder, you need to set addition permissions using the Add-PublicFolderClientPermission cmdlet."

For example, you may designate a mailbox database as a journaling database in which only mailboxes you manually specify should be located. Or you might want to temporarily remove a database from rotation to perform scheduled maintenance. Exchange 2013 gives you the option to either permanently or temporarily exclude databases from the exclusion process using the IsExcludedFromProvisioning parameter that can be set using the \nSet-MailboxDatabase cmdlet."
