However, in order to retrieve keys and secrets from Azure Key<br>Vault, you need to authorize a user or application with Azure Key Vault, which in its turn needs another credential. Managed Service Identity avoids the need of storing credentials for Azure Key Vault in application or environment settings by creating a Service Principal for each application or cloud service on which<br>Managed Service Identity is enabled. This Service Principal enables you to call a local MSI endpoint to get an access token from Azure AD using the credentials of the Service Principal. This token is then used to authenticate to an Azure Service, for example Azure Key Vault.<br><br>Box 2: Azure Key Vault -<br>Azure Key Vault allows you to securely access sensitive information from within your applications:<br>* Keys, secrets, and certificates are protected without your having to write the code yourself, and you can easily use them from your applications.<br>Use Azure Key Vault to store only secrets for your application. Examples of secrets that should be stored in Key Vault include:<br><br>Client application secrets -<br><br>Connection strings -<br><br>Passwords -<br><br>Shared access keys -<br><br>SSH keys -<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/developers-guide https://integration.team/blog/retrieve-azure-key-vault-secrets-using-azure-functions-and-managed-service-identity",

    "answerDescription": "Box 1: ID -<br>Scenario: Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.<br>ID token - A JWT that contains claims that you can use to identify users in your application. This token is securely sent in HTTP requests for communication between two components of the same application or service. You can use the claims in an ID token as you see fit. They're commonly used to display account information or to make access control decisions in an application. ID tokens are signed, but the're not encrypted. When your application or API receives an ID token, it must validate the signature to prove that the token is authentic. Your application or API must also validate a few claims in the token to prove that it's valid.<br>Depending on the scenario requirements, the claims validated by an application can vary, but your application must perform some common claim validations in every scenario.<br><br>Box 2: Oid -<br>Oid - The immutable identifier for the \"principal\" of the request - the user or service principal whose identity has been verified. In ID tokens and app+user tokens, this is the object ID of the user. In app-only tokens, this is the object ID of the calling service principal. It can also be used to perform authorization checks safely and as a key in database tables. This ID uniquely identifies the principal across applications - two different applications signing in the same user will receive the same value in the oid claim.<br>Incorrect:<br>Aud - Identifies the intended recipient of the token. For Azure AD B2C, the audience is the application ID. Your application should validate this value and reject the token if it doesn't match. Audience is synonymous with resource.<br>Idp - Records the identity provider that authenticated the subject of the token. This value is identical to the value of the Issuer claim unless the user account not in the same tenant as the issuer - guests, for instance. If the claim isn't present, it means that the value of iss can be used instead. For personal accounts being used in an organizational context (for instance, a personal account invited to an Azure AD tenant), the idp claim may be 'live.com' or an STS URI containing the<br>Microsoft account tenant.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens",
