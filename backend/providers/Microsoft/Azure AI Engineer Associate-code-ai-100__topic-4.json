Yes\n\nConfiguring Azure Monitor for containers would meet the goal of monitoring the scoring accuracy of each run of the model deployed to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container.\n\nAzure Monitor for containers provides monitoring capabilities specifically designed for containerized workloads running on AKS. It allows you to collect and analyze performance metrics, logs, and events from your AKS cluster, including the containers running your Azure Machine Learning model.\n\nBy configuring Azure Monitor for containers, you can gain visibility into the performance and behavior of your model. You can monitor key metrics such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and container health. Additionally, you can set up alerts based on specific conditions or thresholds, enabling you to proactively monitor the scoring accuracy and detect any anomalies or issues that may arise."

While it provides valuable insights into container-level metrics and logs, it does not specifically focus on monitoring the scoring accuracy of a machine learning model.\n\nTo monitor the scoring accuracy of the model, you would need to implement additional monitoring and logging within your application code. This could involve logging the predictions and comparing them to the ground truth values, setting up custom metrics, or leveraging Azure Application Insights for more detailed monitoring and analysis."

Shared Access Signature (SAS)\n\nTo provide temporary and time-limited access to the video files while ensuring authentication, the recommended solution is to use.\n\nShared Access Signature (SAS) is a secure way to grant limited access to resources in Azure storage. It allows you to specify permissions, validity duration, and access constraints for a specific resource. In this case, you can generate a SAS token with a five-minute validity period for each video file.\n\nBy using SAS, you can generate unique URLs for each video file that include the SAS token. These URLs can be provided to authorized users, including temporary employees who may not have user accounts in Azure AD. When a user accesses the URL within the specified time limit, the SAS token allows them to access the video file. After the token expires, the access is automatically revoked, ensuring the temporary and time-limited nature of access."

No\n\nThe solution of exposing a Machine Learning model as an Azure web service does not meet the goal of detecting anomalies in the data generated by Azure IoT Edge devices and adding information about the anomaly to the Azure IoT Hub stream.\n\nExposing a Machine Learning model as an Azure web service would typically involve deploying the model as a web API endpoint that can be accessed by external applications or services. However, this approach does not address the requirement of running the model directly on the IoT Edge devices and adding anomaly information to the Azure IoT Hub stream.\n\nTo achieve the goal, you would need to deploy an Azure Machine Learning model as an IoT Edge module. This allows you to run the machine learning model directly on the edge devices, enabling real-time anomaly detection on the devices themselves. Once an anomaly is detected, the IoT Edge module can add relevant information about the anomaly to the Azure IoT Hub stream."

From the Azure Application Insights page, you can use Application Insights for monitoring output data, responses, requests stats, exceptions, failure rates, dependency rates, etc. Although \"output data\" sounds convincing, this is very different from \"compute performance\", which is what we want to monitor. Collecting output data doesn't necessarily tell us about model performance. Model data collection, on the other hand, allows for tracking \"data drift\", which is how the performance of your model is changing over time, so I would say this is probably what is meant by monitoring \"compute performance\".

You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.\n\nIoT Hub supports communications both from the device to the cloud and from the cloud to the device. IoT Hub supports multiple messaging patterns such as device-to-cloud telemetry, file upload from devices, and request-reply methods to control your devices from the cloud. IoT Hub monitoring helps you maintain the health of your solution by tracking events such as device creation, device failures, and device connections."
