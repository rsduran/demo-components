        "content": "1. Webhook, this definitely seems to be the answer as the company is looking to build the app to have keyword synchronous calls which the Azure Service Bus is incapable of handling.\n\n2. Azure Event Hub, since the specifications said \"high peak load\", I would assume it would mean that there would be a lot of entries and data being ingested, and one of the key features of the event hubs are that they would be able to ingest millions of events relatively quickly.\n\n3. Plugins, I know the Azure Event Hub seems tempting, but given some overview it does not look to directly address giving notifications of changes within the app. Looking at plug-ins however, Plug-Ins have many oppurtunities through power automate as well as Service Busses and Webhooks to fully take advantage of notifying of \"address\" changes. IMO, it might even be more straightforward to use plug-ins."
