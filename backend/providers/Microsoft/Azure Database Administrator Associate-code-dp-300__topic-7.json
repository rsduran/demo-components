The correct real world methodology (assuming you have all the time in the world which you seldom will have) is to recover from last known good backup.

Then you would run DBCC CHECKDB with the REPAIR_REBUILD option. This will not cause data loss. After that because you're the only one with access from a query window now issue the ALTER DATABASE SET SINGLE_USER statement and, if approved, use the REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS statement and then set the database back to multiuser."
