This approach aligns with Zero Trust principles by allowing you to gain insights into the behavior of devices without introducing potential risks associated with active scanning. It helps in understanding the normal traffic patterns and identifying anomalies or suspicious activities without impacting the operation of OT and IoT devices.\nB. Threat Monitoring:\n\nThreat monitoring is essential for actively monitoring and analyzing security events to detect and respond to potential threats. Implementing threat monitoring aligns with Zero Trust principles by continuously assessing the security posture of OT and IoT devices. This proactive approach enables the identification of security incidents and allows for timely responses to mitigate risks, all while minimizing disruptions to business operations."

A node image contains up-to-date OS security patches, OS kernel updates, Kubernetes security updates, updated versions of binaries like kubelet, and component version updates that are listed in the release notes.\n\nWhen a node image is updated, a cordon and drain action is triggered on the target node pool's nodes:\n\n    A node with the updated image is added to the node pool. The number of nodes added at a time is governed by the surge value.\n    One of the existing nodes is cordoned and drained. Cordoning ensures that the node doesn't schedule pods. Draining removes its pods and schedules them to other nodes.\n    After the node is fully drained, it's removed from the node pool. The updated node added by the surge replaces it.\n    This process is repeated for each node that needs to be updated in the node pool.\n\nA similar process occurs during a cluster upgrade.\n\nSource: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/operator-guides/aks/aks-upgrade-practices"

Enable self-healing in Microsoft 365 Defender is the one that aligns most closely with this goal.\n\nSelf-healing capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender can automatically detect, investigate, and remediate security threats, which would otherwise require manual intervention by SOC analysts. By automating these processes, you can minimize the operational load on Tier 1 analysts and allow them to focus on more complex security issues.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are relevant to various aspects of security and compliance but don't specifically target the operational load on Tier 1 SOC analysts in the same way that option B does. Therefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Enable self-healing in Microsoft 365 Defender."

Enable self-healing in Microsoft 365 Defender: Enabling self-healing capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender can significantly reduce the operational load on Tier 1 SOC analysts. Self-healing features automate the detection and remediation of common security issues and threats, allowing for faster response times and reducing the need for manual intervention. By automating the remediation process, Tier 1 analysts can focus on more complex and critical security incidents, improving efficiency and productivity."

Enable built-in compliance policies in Azure Policy: While compliance policies are essential for maintaining security and compliance, they do not directly address minimizing the operational load on SOC analysts. These policies help in ensuring that resources are compliant with organizational standards but may require SOC analysts to review and remediate non-compliant resources."
