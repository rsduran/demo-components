Problem Statements<br><br>ADatum identifies the following issues:<br><br>\u2022\tMultiple users in the sales department have up to five devices. The sales department users report that sometimes they must contact the support department to join their devices to the Azure AD tenant because they have reached their device limit.<br>\u2022\tA recent security incident reveals that several users leaked their credentials, a suspicious browser was used for a sign-in, and resources were accessed from an anonymous IP address.<br>\u2022\tWhen you attempt to assign the Device Administrators role to IT_Group1, the group does NOT appear in the selection list.<br>\u2022\tAnyone in the organization can invite guest users, including other guests and non-administrators.<br>\u2022\tThe helpdesk spends too much time resetting user passwords.<br>\u2022\tUsers currently use only passwords for authentication.<br><br><br>Requirements.
