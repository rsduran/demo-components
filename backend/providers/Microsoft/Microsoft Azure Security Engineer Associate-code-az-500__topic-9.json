Its not horribly clear but this article has the answer on how to deploy PIM. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-deployment-plan\n\"Only owners of subscriptions and management groups can bring these resources under management by Privileged Identity Management. After it is under management, the PIM functionality is available for owners at all levels including management group, subscription, resource group, and resource. If you're a Global Administrator trying to deploy Privileged Identity Management for your Azure resources, you can elevate access to manage all Azure subscriptions to give yourself access to all Azure resources in the directory for discovery. \""
