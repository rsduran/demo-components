The \"minimum number of datasets\" can be interpreted as the minimum number of distinct dataset entities registered in the workspace. With versioning (Option D), you're still working with one dataset entity, but with multiple versions, which aligns with the requirement of minimal dataset registration.\n\nJustification:\n- Versioning in Azure Machine Learning allows you to handle the evolving data by creating new versions of the dataset each month, without increasing the number of dataset entities in the workspace.\n- By using version tags, you can manage and reference the appropriate data snapshot for experiments as needed.\n- This approach offers a balance between efficient data management and the ability to run experiments on specific subsets of the data as of a given date, thus meeting all the stated requirements."

Transposing a dataset does not convert categorical variables into a format suitable for regression analysis. Transposing is a matrix operation that flips a table over its diagonal, turning rows into columns and vice versa. This operation does not transform categorical data into a numerical format.\n\nIn contrast, the 'map' function in pandas is used to match and transform values in a Series based on a given dictionary of correspondences. In the case of the product categories 'Bikes', 'Cars', 'Vans', and 'Boats', these categories are to be mapped to numerical values {1, 2, 3, 4}, as specified in the ProductCategoryMapping dictionary. The purpose of this is to transform the categorical data into a numerical format that can be understood by regression models in scikit-learn."

Replace using Probabilistic PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is not the most suitable method for cleaning missing data in this scenario, as it is typically used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, rather than imputing missing values.

Relative Expression Split: This mode applies to conditions on a number column, which could include date/time fields.\nFor time series data, where the sequence and continuity of data points are important, neither randomization (as in Split Rows with randomization) nor pattern-based splits (as in Regular Expression Split) are appropriate.

The key pair consists of a private key, which you keep secure on your machine, and a public key that you will share.\n2. Add the public key to the Git account. Once the key pair is generated, the public key must be added to your Git account settings. This allows the Git server to recognize and authenticate your SSH requests.\n3. Clone the Git repository by using an SSH repository URL. After your public key is accepted by the Git server, you can securely clone the repository using SSH, which will utilize your private key for authentication."

These statistics are useful to understand the distribution and variability of the data, but they don't provide information about missing or malformed values.\n\nThe Type statistic represents the data type of each column, such as integer, float, or string.
