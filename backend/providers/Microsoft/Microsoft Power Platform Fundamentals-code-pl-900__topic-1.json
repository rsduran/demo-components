But a solution to do what?\nBoth creating an alert in D365 and creating a Power BI report are low cost solutions, but with different purposes.\nBut there is no mention in the question that D365 is being used as an operational system.\nTherefore one has to assume that the \"solution\" would be to create a cost effective way to lookup the correct tax rate, to use in whatever sales ordering system the warehouses are using.\nIt feels like a Power BI report might be the better option here,  as it could be used to get a tax rate by applying filters.\nBesides, even if we consider that it is implicit that D365 is used as the operational system, I assume that tax rates are global settings, so once changed, D365 should pick up the new rate? What would be the point of the alert?"

To enable single sign-on (SSO) between Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales and Microsoft 365 (formerly known as Office 365), both services should ideally be in the same Microsoft 365 tenant. This setup allows users to sign in once to access both services without the need to enter their credentials separately.\n\nWhen Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 are in the same tenant, you can set up and configure SSO using technologies like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft Identity Platform.

This shared identity service enables Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to both Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 applications without needing to log in separately for each service.

Business rules provide a simple interface to implement and maintain fast-changing and commonly used rules.<br><br>Box 2: business process flows -<br>Flows Power Automate includes several types of processes, each designed for a different purpose:<br>\u2711 Automated flows. Create a flow that performs one or more tasks automatically after it's triggered by an event.<br>\u2711 Button flows. Perform repetitive tasks simply by tapping a button on your mobile device.<br>\u2711 Scheduled flows. Create a flow that performs one or more tasks on a schedule such as once a day, on a specific date, or after a certain time.<br>\u2711 Business process flows. Ensure that people enter data consistently and follow the same steps every time they work in an app by creating a business process flow.<br>\u2711 Workflows and actions. Dynamics 365 customizers may be familiar with the classic Common Data Service processes, which are workflows and actions.<br><br>Box 3: Common Data Model -<br>Model-driven app design is a component-focused approach to app development. Model-driven app design doesn't require code and the apps you make can be simple or very complex. Unlike canvas app development where the designer has complete control over app layout, with model-driven apps much of the layout is determined for you and largely designated by the components you add to the app.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/guide-staff-through-common-tasks-processes https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview",

The two primary operations that you can use for connectors are:\n\nTrigger Operations: These operations allow the app to respond to specific events. For example, a connector might have a trigger operation that initiates whenever a new record is added to a database.\nAction Operations: These operations allow the app to perform actions on the data source. For example, an action operation might include creating, reading, updating, or deleting data in a database."

This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations). Actions can also involve executing specific functions or procedures defined in the data source or service. For example, a connector to a CRM system might provide actions to add a new customer record or update an existing order.\n\nTriggers\nExplanation: Triggers are used to initiate a process in response to an event. In Power Automate, part of the Power Platform, connectors use triggers to start workflows or flows based on certain events. For instance, a trigger could be set up to start a flow when a new row is added to a database table, or when a new email arrives in an inbox. These triggers enable automated workflows that respond to changes or actions in connected systems."

Drill-down filters enhance interactivity and provide deeper insights into the data.\n\nD. Manual filters: Manual filters are user-defined filters that allow report viewers to select specific values or ranges. Users can manually choose which data they want to include or exclude in the report. These filters are flexible and customizable, enabling users to focus on relevant information.\n\nE. External filters: External filters are applied from external sources or parameters. For example, you can pass filter values from a URL parameter, another report, or an application. External filters allow seamless integration with other systems and enable dynamic filtering based on context."

However, since streaming isn't explicitly mentioned, this answer feels incomplete.\n\nD: Many people choose D 'because it's not E'. But why D then? Where is it? I had a look around the center and couldn't find a list. That doesn't mean it isn't there, but please people, when voting for an answer please provide arguments.\n\nE: If the question wasn't about 'dashboard' connectors, the answer would have been crystal clear. Open Power BI Desktop, choose 'Get data', and there's a full list of available connectors. Seeing as a dashboard usually contains report data (from PBI Desktop), and as many people confuse 'reports' with 'dashboards', I'd say E is the best answer.\n\nIn order of likeliness, I'd say E &gt; A &gt; D."

The approach works on the basis of creating aggregated tables from the main detailed fact table. The calculations and visuals then will be using the aggregated table which is smaller and faster in the response time.\nAnswer Cant be Model view because Model view shows all of the tables, columns, and relationships in your model. This view can be especially helpful when your model has complex relationships between many tables. This has nothing to do with performance"

Power BI Service: Power BI service is a web-based service that allows you to view and share Power BI reports, but it does not include the tool to join tables.\n\nC. Microsoft Excel: You can use Excel to join tables, but Power BI has its own tool called Query Editor that is more powerful and allows you to join tables in a more efficient way.\n\nD. Data Connector: Data connectors are used to connect to various data sources, but it does not include the tool to join tables."

A Template app is a pre-built solution that contains a collection of dashboards, reports, and datasets that can be customized and shared with specific users or groups of users. When a vendor views a Template app, they are accessing a version of the app that is hosted within their own tenant environment, which means they can securely view the report without needing to be given direct access to the original report.\n\nDashboards, mobile apps, and workspaces are not the best options for this scenario as they do not provide the same level of tenant-level isolation and control as a Template app. Dashboards are typically used for monitoring specific KPIs, mobile apps are designed for on-the-go access to data, and workspaces are used for collaboration between team members."

Field - Store information about the doctor's speciality\n\nIn question there is \"a place to enter the doctor's specialty in the profile form\". So each doctor have only ONE speciality and this data can be a part of existing tables.

AppSource is Microsoft\u2019s marketplace for business apps.\n\nHowever, in the context of your question, you\u2019re looking to share a model-driven app with other members of a specific department. Publishing to AppSource might be excessive for this purpose, and it could potentially expose the app to users outside of the intended audience.\n\nTherefore, while it\u2019s technically possible to use AppSource in this way, it\u2019s generally more appropriate to use the sharing features within Power Apps itself for this kind of internal sharing. That\u2019s why options A and B are typically recommended in this scenario.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s crucial to consider the specific needs and context of your situation when deciding how to share your app. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"

I want to schedule a daily flow that sends out a greeting to the persons in the 'Birthdays' entity if it is their birthday that day. \n\nThe first thing I do is that I list all the records from the 'Birthday' entity and simultaneously I get the current time from 'Current Time'-action which is found in the 'Date Time'-connector. \n\nSecond I apply a Condition to each value from the 'birthday' field to check if the birthday is equal to current time. If yes - send a birthday greeting mail. \n\nA possible problem with the above solution is, that the 'Current Time'-action have the following format: '2020-06-30T14:07:13.8691592Z'. So - if you want to use the 'is equal to' condition, you will need to format the 'Current Date' with the expression formatDateTime().\n\nSince we don't know what the problem is, both A and B could both be corrent (or wrong)."

Now create 2 new flows - one that sends an email that no intervention is needed, the other that sends a text message that the team needs assistance (trigger will be  power apps, action will be Send email v2)\n4. Next, drag 2 new buttons to your blank canvas, name them \"Things are going well\" and \"I need help\", then in the \"OnSelect\" property of each button, type \"Power\" to search and scroll down to the names of the flows you made it step 3 (make sure you're selecting the one with RUN() at end)\n5.

Actions allow you to perform specific tasks or operations using the data or services exposed by the connector.

For example, if the connector is for a database system, tables would represent different database tables. In a CRM system, tables might correspond to entities like \"Contacts,\" \"Accounts,\" or \"Opportunities.\""

Testers can interact with the chatbot directly within the designer interface, allowing them to see the workflow as they test different scenarios. This approach provides a convenient and efficient way to test the chatbot's functionality and ensures that testers can verify the behavior of the chatbot across multiple topics before publishing it.

These features are used to match user input to the appropriate topic or question in the chatbot.\n\nWhile AI features are important for recognizing and understanding user input, they alone do not determine how the chatbot will handle unrecognized input. The fallback topic serves as a catch-all for input that is not recognized by the chatbot's AI features, and allows you to configure a specific response or action for those situations. So it's important to have a fallback topic configured in addition to using AI features to ensure the chatbot can respond appropriately to any user input."

Therefore, by configuring a column to be hidden by default and visible when the checkbox is checked, the requirement for the hidden field to appear is fulfilled.\n\n2. TABLE - List of customers and fields display: To display a list of customers and fields about customers, the appropriate component to use is a Table. In a model-driven app, a Table component can be configured to show a list of records from a specific entity, such as the customers entity in this scenario. The Table component allows for displaying multiple fields about each customer in a tabular format, meeting the requirement to display a list of customers and fields about customers."

This involves using the recording feature to capture the series of steps the user performs within the older Windows application.\n\n- **Step 3: Add Input Variables**: Finally, after recording the tasks, input variables need to be added to enable the user to specify the values to be entered when the automation is run on the computer.
