An Effective lesson should involve collaboration with other reliable resources using ICT in which case B, but I guess the answer (A) is based on the assumption that it is an effective lesson plan. Either ways, I would still go with B because effective makes both the lesson and the lesson plan only a means to an end. The lesson or the lesson plan cannot be effective in itself and can only be measured by students' engagement and learning. I think if I want a class to be effective, downloading the best lesson plan WOULD ONLY HELP if I know how to use it. I go with B."
