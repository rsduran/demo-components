A published wiki is backed by a Git repository, so the order of pages is determined by the order of files in the repository.\n\nRenaming pages in the navigation pane will not change their order, and creating a wiki.md file at the root of the wiki will not change the page hierarchy.\n\nTherefore, the best approach to change the order of pages in the navigation pane of a published wiki in the Azure DevOps portal is to simply drag and drop the pages to the desired order."
