If a user from a trusted forests wants to access that file share, that user account has to be explicitly granted \"Allowed to Authenticate\" right on the file server. Only then the Domain Controller will authenticate the user, otherwise Domain Controller will reject the authentication request, and the user will not be part of \"Authenticated User\" group.\" \nFrom : https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/50969.active-directory-forest-trust-attention-points.aspx"

It also helps you monitor network connectivity to service and application endpoints and monitor the performance of<br>Azure ExpressRoute.<br>Note:<br>IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen,<br>IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.<br>IP flow verify looks at the rules for all Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to the network interface, such as a subnet or virtual machine NIC. Traffic flow is then verified based on the configured settings to or from that network interface. IP flow verify is useful in confirming if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview",

If your directory has a per-user Azure Multi-Factor Authentication provider, you can add MFA licenses. Users with licenses are not counted in the per-user consumption-based billing.

It is the cloud-based ETL and data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating data movement and transforming data at scale. Using Azure Data Factory, you can create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that can ingest data from disparate data stores. You can build complex ETL processes that transform data visually with data flows or by using compute services such as Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Database. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/introduction"
