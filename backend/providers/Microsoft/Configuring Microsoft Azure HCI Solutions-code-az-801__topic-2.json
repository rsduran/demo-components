So the Dynamic Quorum doesn't compute the new quorum required and we can't go down to the \"Last-man standing\" situation. If all the fails are sequential, it seems to be indeed possible to get down to one node with the configuration showed in the question.\nBut again, with simultaneous fails, we need to have no more than 3 nodes that fail so that we keep the quorum of 4 thanks to our initial 6 nodes + 1 active dynamic witness due to the starting even number of nodes. That will leaves us with 3+1 votes and the cluster runs. \nIf 4 nodes crashes SIMULTANEOUSLY, we are left with 2+1 votes and the cluster shuts down.\nAgain, that is my understanding because Microsoft documentation isn't clear in the 4 nodes example about that fact that the failures are sequentials."

So to actually increase the priority of Server2 you *have* to tick it. Otherwise you're *NOT* changing the priority. The question however doesn't state that you tick it. \n\nSo is the question asking if you know this? Or is it assuming that you know that the only way to actually change the priority is to tick them first? \n\nAs it stands, if you assume that you actually change the priority then you have to tick Server2 to do so and the answer is Yes.  If you change the Priority order without ticking then it is the same as moving the server up, wont change the order, will leave it without a preferred owner (so it won't fail over to Server1 anyway) but it doesn't fulfil the requirement of *Ensuring* that it won't fail over to Server1 so the answer is No."

No.\nAs node 1 is in the same site as node 2, the preference will be to failover the DFS role on node 1.\n\n3. Yes\nSite 1 has 2 nodes with the DFS role. Even if site 2 fails, 3 votes will still be remaining (node1, node2 and cloud witness) which is sufficient to maintain quorum."
