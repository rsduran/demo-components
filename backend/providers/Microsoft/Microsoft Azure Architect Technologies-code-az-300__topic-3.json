A series CPU Optimized VMs doesn't fit 'reduce costs between request spikes' since they are always on. Turn some of VMs off cannot handle spike well. So option B is off. Option D are similar to Option B but Microsoft tried to loot you with ACS on VMs. Although ACS (deprecated?) might have quickier warm up time, but VMs scaling is still a problem related to cost. Also Option C will be cost less than Option D since the customer does not need to maintain a single VM at all."

Each region can have many webspaces, but your app can only move between plans that are created in the same webspace. An App Service Environment is an isolated webspace, so apps can be moved between plans in the same App Service Environment, but not between plans in different App Service Environments.\n\nYou can\u2019t specify the webspace you want when creating a plan, but it\u2019s possible to ensure that a plan is created in the same webspace as an existing plan. In brief, all plans created with the same resource group and region combination are deployed into the same webspace. For example, if you created a plan in resource group A and region B, then any plan you subsequently create in resource group A and region B is deployed into the same webspace. Note that plans can\u2019t move webspaces after they\u2019re created, so you can\u2019t move a plan into \u201cthe same webspace\u201d as another plan by moving it to another resource group."

SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks.<br><br>Box 2: ELB1 -<br>Public IP addresses allow Internet resources to communicate inbound to Azure resources. Public IP addresses also enable Azure resources to communicate outbound to Internet and public-facing Azure services with an IP address assigned to the resource.<br>Note: In Azure Resource Manager, a public IP address is a resource that has its own properties.
