Files in those locations won't be audited and any files that are created or modified in those locations won't be subject to DLP policy enforcement. You can configure path exclusions in DLP settings.\u201d\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-configure-endpoint-settings?view=o365-worldwide#file-path-exclusions\n\nThis is how we exclude sensitive file files from DLP monitoring."

        "content": "How come this solution meets the goal: From the Microsoft 365 Endpoint data loss prevention (Endpoint DLP) settings, you add a folder path to the file path exclusions ?\nThis solution meets the goal because by excluding the folder path that contains the sensitive documents, Endpoint DLP will ignore the files in that folder, and Tailspin will not be able to access them. By excluding the folder path, the sensitive documents will be protected while allowing Tailspin to access other files. This solution will block Tailspin from accessing sensitive documents on the computers without preventing the application from accessing other documents, which is the goal.\n\nIt is important to note that this solution relies on the assumption that the sensitive documents are stored in a specific folder and that Tailspin has access to that folder. Additionally, it is important to test the exclusion path before applying it to the production environment and to continuously monitor the folder path to ensure that no other sensitive information is stored in it.\nSo my conclusion is A - YES"

This report provides an overview of the triggered rules and can help you understand what specific conditions are leading to the policies being activated.\n\nThe most appropriate option, therefore, would be:\n\nA. DLP policy matches\nThis report will help identify the rules that have been triggered, providing insights into the specific conditions under which DLP policies are being applied.
