Provide grounding content: This involves feeding the chatbot with relevant domain-specific information and data. This can include documents, articles, FAQs, or any other content related to the chatbot's purpose. By providing this context, the chatbot can better understand the user's intent and respond in a more relevant and informative way.\n\n2. Add sample request/response pairs:  This technique involves providing the chatbot with a set of pre-defined questions and their corresponding answers. This helps the chatbot learn the conversation patterns and phrasing related to its specific domain. By analyzing these examples, the chatbot can improve its ability to generate natural and consistent responses to user queries.\n\nBoth options (A. Provide grounding content and C. Add sample request/response pairs) achieve the goal of improving response quality with minimal development effort, as they do not require extensive retraining or model building.\n\nTherefore, the two correct answers are:\n\nB. Provide grounding content.\nC. Add sample request/response pairs."
