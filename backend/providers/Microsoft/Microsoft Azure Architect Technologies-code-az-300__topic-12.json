The only way to do it is in an ASE, Ase needs an Isolate tier.\n* The cost of App1 and App2 must be minimized: The Plans Free, Shared and Basic haven\u2019t Virtual Network connectivity, so we only have Standard, Premium and Isolate that support it. Therefore Standard the cheaper, Premium and Isolated app service tier is the more expensive, But only Isolate is able to deploy in a VN.\n* Connection Private on a VM and deployed directly to an Azure virtual network: An ASE always exists in a virtual network, and more precisely, within a subnet of a virtual network. You can use the security features of virtual networks to control inbound and outbound network communications for your apps.

There is the multi-tenant public service, which hosts App Service plans in the Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, and Premiumv2 pricing SKUs. Then there is the single tenant App Service Environment(ASE), which hosts Isolated SKU App Service plans directly in your Azure Virtual Network (VNet)\".\n\nThus, ISOLATED = deployment directly on VNet, which is a requirement, which means that the answer given is INCORRECT! It does make sense because since, in the other plans, you'd be on a shared instance, you wouldn't be in position to decide on which VNet the app will be available. \n\nAutoswap is a feature that allows setting up staging environments for the deployments of App updates and Webjobs refer to background jobs to be run by the App. Therefore, unrelated to the requirements. What it is required is for the App to process the Blobs immediately and this cannot be met if the App is put to sleep (it takes some time to wake up). Always On it is then."
