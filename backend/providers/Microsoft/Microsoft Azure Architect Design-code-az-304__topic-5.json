CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.<br>Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).<br><br>Box 2: Azure Redis Cache -<br>Azure Cache for Redis is based on the popular software Redis. It is typically used as a cache to improve the performance and scalability of systems that rely heavily on backend data-stores.

In the alternative user subscription mode, Batch VMs and other resources are created directly in your subscription when a pool is created. User subscription mode is required if you want to create Batch pools using Azure Reserved VM Instances. To create a Batch account in user subscription mode, you must also register your subscription with Azure Batch, and associate the account with an Azure Key Vault.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/nodes-and-pools#node-type-and-target\n\nDedicated nodes.

Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network and routing optimizations.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cdn/",

This interface is in addition to the standard Azure Ethernet network interface available in the other VM sizes.\n\nThis secondary interface allows the RDMA-capable instances to communicate over an InfiniBand (IB) network, operating at HDR rates for HBv3, HBv2, EDR rates for HB, HC, NDv2, and FDR rates for H16r, H16mr, and other RDMA-capable N-series virtual machines.

The on-premise network is 172.16.0.0/16, that is from 172.16.0.1 to 172.16.255.255, so the answers 172.16.0.0/16 and 172.16.1.0/28 are not valid (overlap with on-pemise subnet)\n2) the range 192.168.1.0/28 is from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.15, only 16 ips and we need 25 IPs, so the only valid answer for subnet1 is 192.168.0.0/24\n3) the range for the gateway can't ovelap with on-premise, and Microsoft recommend that would be /27 or /28, so the answer valid for gateway is 192.168.1.0/28\n\nCheck the example: https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal"
