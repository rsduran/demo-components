The Jenkins job gets triggered automatically. The Dockerfile is checked out from Github.<br>Stage 2: Docker builds an image from the Dockerfile and then the image is tagged with the build number. Additionally, the latest tag is also attached to the image for the containers to use.<br>Stage 3: We have default deployment and service YAML files stored on the Jenkins server. Jenkins makes a copy of the default YAML files, make the necessary changes according to the build and put them in a separate folder.<br>Stage 4: kubectl was initially configured at the time of setting up AKS on the Jenkins server. The YAML files are fed to the kubectl util which in turn creates pods and services.<br>Reference:<br>https://medium.com/velotio-perspectives/continuous-deployment-with-azure-kubernetes-service-azure-container-registry-jenkins-ca337940151b",
