        "content": "D is not the correct answer here.  The correct answer should be C - In the public DNS zone of contoso.com, add a CNAME record.  Rationale: A custom domain can be applied to a WebApp without adding the domain to active directory.  A canonical name (CNAME) resource record can be used, or an IPv4 host resource record (A) in conjunction with a text (TXT) record to verify ownership of the domain, and the WebApp will serve requests using the custom domain presented in the Hostname HTTP header accordingly."
