End users must not be required to accept the End User License Agreement (EULA).<br>Windows Autopilot is a collection of technologies used to set up and pre-configure new devices, getting them ready for productive use. You can also use Windows<br>Autopilot to reset, repurpose and recover devices.<br>The OEM Windows 10 installation on the new computers can be transformed into a \u05d2\u20acbusiness-ready\u05d2\u20ac state, applying settings and policies, installing apps, and even changing the edition of Windows 10 being used (e.g. from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise) to support advanced features.<br>The only interaction required from the end user is to connect to a network and to verify their credentials. Everything beyond that is automated.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/windows-autopilot",
