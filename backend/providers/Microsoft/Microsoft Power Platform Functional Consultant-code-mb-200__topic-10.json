So as per my understanding, there is some issue with the Role which can be checked and modified."

Users are assigned to teams\"\nThis means security roles aren't directly assigned to users, but users inherit the security roles assigned to the Teams they belong to.\nSo if only 1 user is experiencing an issue with security, then it means that User is not assigned to the correct Team. The issue is not with the security role, because then other users would also have the same issue."

Meaning:\ndo you modify the team of the agent ? No, because record is assigned directly to agent so not a team issue.\ndo you modify the role of the agent ? Yes, because each agent/user in dynamics must have at least 1 sec role(at user level) and this role is missing the basic read only on contact entity."
