Overview -<br><br>An Azure Data Factory pipeline produces flat-file extracts of all customers, events, and survey response data from every regional CRM system, and copies them to the corporate data lake imports container daily. These extracts are produced in pipe-delimited text format and each type of extract file has the same schema. The pipeline runs at 1 a.m. US Eastern Standard Time (UTC -5). Each regional system extract has the same format.<br><br><br>CRM data extracts. Customers -<br><br>Customer data is represented as records in the Customer extract file. This file contains customer address and contact information. Because customers can make purchases in more than one region, the same customer may be represented in multiple regional extract files. Regional extracts may also contain multiple records corresponding to the same individual customer.<br><br>Each record in a single regional extract will have a unique customer number value. The customer number value is not guaranteed to be unique across all regional extracts. Each customer file contains fewer than 50,000 records.<br><br>CRM data extracts.

Survey responses<br><br>Each customer is also sent a customer satisfaction survey after the conclusion of every event. The survey includes numeric rating of 1-5 (1 being least satisfied and 5 being most satisfied) and a free-text response field for the customers to share their impressions of the event.<br><br>The schema for the three files in each extract is shown below:<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-260/image24.png\"><br><br>Customer Insights configuration. Data sources<br><br>Your team is responsible for the configuration of Customer Insights. You are an Administrator in the environment.<br><br>Your team has configured a separate data source corresponding to the customer file extracts from each regional operation. Each data source uses a Microsoft Power Query text file connector to ingest the extract files. The Microsoft Enhanced Addresses enrichment has been enabled for each regional data source. The enrichment name for each region is the region name (East, West or Central) followed by \"addresses.\"<br><br>Your team has also configured a fourth data source using Power Query to create consolidated files containing all event tickets and survey response records. These two new files have the same layout as the regional files. Customer email addresses are included in these files because customer numbers are not unique across regions.<br><br>Customer Insights configuration. Customer profiles<br><br>Your team has defined a Unified Customer Profile based on the three different customer extract files. The East and West regional customer extracts have deduplication rules configured with the default merge preferences and the following criteria:<br><br>1. Exact matches on LastName, HomeAddress, City and PostalCode.<br>2. Exact matches on FirstName, LastName, EmailAddress and normalized PhoneNumber.<br><br>The Central regional customer extract does not have any deduplication rules configured.<br><br>Your team has configured matching to start with the East region customer extract as the primary entity, then the Central region, then the West region. Each regional entity is configured to include all records, and subsequent entities match the previous entity using the following conditions:<br><br>1. Exact matches on LastName and normalized PhoneNumber.<br>2. Exact matches on normalized PhoneNumber, EmailAddress and Country.<br><br>Customer Insights configuration. Activities<br><br>Your team has added activities based on the event ticket and survey response extracts.

Post-purchase follow-up email - This email is sent the day after a customer purchases an event ticket. It contains generic information about upcoming events for the region. BYE leadership wants to replace the generic content with a personalized set of recommended event types the customer might want to consider. There are no restrictions on the types of events that can be recommended.<br>2. Post-event email - This email is sent the day after an event concludes, and it includes a link to the customer survey.<br><br><br>Data issues -<br><br>1. A significant number of BYE customers are duplicated in the regional file extracts. Manual review of a random sampling of duplicates returned the following findings: a. Duplicate records frequently have different values for street address such as inconsistencies in spelling and abbreviations for common words like \u201cstreet,\u201d \u201cavenue,\u201d \u201cdrive,\u201d etc. b. Duplicate records typically share the same values for last name, email address, city, state or province, postal code, and country. c. Duplicate records typically do not share the same values for first name.<br>2. An automated process in the East regional CRM system recently updated the state or province component of several thousand customers\u2019 addresses with incorrect values. All other components of these customers\u2019 addresses are still presumed correct.<br>3. An automated process in the Central regional CRM system recently deleted the first name values for several hundred customers.<br><br><br>Predictive models -<br><br>The data science team has built inference pipelines in three different workspaces.<br><br>Your user account has the following access:<br><br>\u2022\tOwner access to BYAEAML01<br>\u2022\tReader access to BYAEAML02<br>\u2022\tUser Access Administrator access to BYAEAML03<br><br>The table below shows the published pipelines in each workspace.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-260/image25.png\"><br><br><br>Future enhancements -<br><br>The marketing team requests your team plan for two updates to BYE\u2019s Customer Insights instance:<br><br>1.
