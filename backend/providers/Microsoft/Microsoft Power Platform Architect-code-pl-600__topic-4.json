Some of the worker support agents are multilingual.<br>If you choose to expand your customer service offering to provide chat and channels, the Customer Service workspace seamlessly adjusts to support managing conversations as well.<br>Note: As an agent with the Customer Service Representative security role, when you open Customer Service workspace, you start on the Customer Service Agent<br>Dashboard unless your administrator has changed the default view. This dashboard shows you your active cases, cases you can work in queues you are assigned to, and your open activities. You can open existing cases and activities or begin working new cases from the queues you are assigned to and create activities.<br>Box 2: Dynamics 365 Customer Service<br>Scenario: First Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-service/csw-overview",
