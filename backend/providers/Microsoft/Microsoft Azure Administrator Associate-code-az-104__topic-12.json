This feature allows you to test the traffic flow to and from a virtual machine by specifying the source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol. It can also show you whether traffic is allowed or denied by network security groups. By using this tool, you can identify any issues with NSGs that may be preventing VM3 from establishing outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the application servers in the Montreal office. Therefore, the correct answer is E."
