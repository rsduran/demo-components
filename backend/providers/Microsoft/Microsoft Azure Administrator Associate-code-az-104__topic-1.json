It addresses the allocation failure specifically for the VM that needs resizing while minimizing disruption to other VMs in the availability set. Once the necessary VM is resized, it can be added back to the availability set to restore its high availability and redundancy features. This approach is more targeted and focused on resolving the specific issue at hand without unnecessary disruption to other resources."

You can only recover the files to a new VM.\n\nWhen dealing with ransomware or other malware infections, it's typically not recommended to recover files directly to the infected VM as there's a risk that the infection could persist. Instead, it's advisable to recover the files to a new VM to ensure they are clean and free from malware. This helps to prevent further spread of the infection and ensures the integrity of the recovered data. Therefore, option C is true in this scenario."
