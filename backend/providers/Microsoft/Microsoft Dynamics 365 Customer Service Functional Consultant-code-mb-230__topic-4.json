This information can include their name, contact details, or any other relevant details that can help identify the customer. The pre-chat survey allows agents to auto detect the customer based on the information provided, enabling a personalized and efficient chat experience.\n\nD. Widget location: Selecting the widget location option allows you to embed the chat widget in a specific domain or web page. This ensures that the chat widget appears and is accessible within the desired website or domain, providing a seamless and integrated chat experience for unauthenticated customers visiting that specific location.\n\nBy utilizing the pre-chat survey and widget location options, you can achieve the desired functionality of auto detecting customers and embedding the chat widget in a specific domain within your Omnichannel for Customer Service implementation."
