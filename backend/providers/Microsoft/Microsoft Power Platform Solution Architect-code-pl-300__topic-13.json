No you do not need a gateway, but you can use a gateway.\nBox2: No\nAgain, you do not \"need\" to configure a scheduled refresh of the dataset if DirectQuery is used, but nothing stops you doing so.\nBox3: Yes\nThere are two authentication methods, being basic and OAuth2, you might use on the dataset to connect to the database/data. With basic authentication method, you will be asked for user name and password. If you use database credential here, you can use the Basic Authentication method. You can use basic authentication but it does not mean you have to use it."

Therefore, (unless you plan to create a composite model) you should  connect to the DB in direct query mode, hence you don't need to schedule any refresh.\n3- Azure SQL allow to use OAuth2. This doesn't mean that you can't use basic authentication anymore. The question asks if you CAN use basic authentication and you can still use it, even though you have the option to use azure authentication.\nIn my opinion the answer is : NO, NO , YES !"
