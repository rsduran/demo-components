    "answerDescription": "Scenario: Contoso must meet technical requirements including:<br>Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in the Montreal office.<br>IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen,<br>IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview<br>Configure and manage virtual networks",
