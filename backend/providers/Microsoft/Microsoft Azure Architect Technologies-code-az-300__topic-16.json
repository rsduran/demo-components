It says that the number of users vary throughout the year and that the infrastructure was resized to accommodate the peaks (probably thinking that we had a hardware performance issue) but the capacity WAS NOT UTILISED, which indicates that actually there was no problem with the hardware allocation. At this point, the info telling us that we do not have the source code becomes important. It may be a problem in the application. \n\nHaving established the above, now look at the request. \"You need to implement a Virtual machine scale set\". A bit weird, isn't it? Just to implement a VMSS. Nothing else is requested. Well, in order to create a VMSS it is mandatory to define \"a default diagnostic metric to trigger scaling\" or answer C.

    "answerDescription": "We should use a Conditional Access policy.<br>Note: There are two ways to secure user sign-in events by requiring multi-factor authentication in Azure AD. The first, and preferred, option is to set up a<br>Conditional Access policy that requires multi-factor authentication under certain conditions. The second option is to enable each user for Azure Multi-Factor<br>Authentication. When users are enabled individually, they perform multi-factor authentication each time they sign in (with some exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remembered devices feature is turned on).<br>Enabling Azure Multi-Factor Authentication using Conditional Access policies is the recommended approach. Changing user states is no longer recommended unless your licenses don't include Conditional Access as it requires users to perform MFA every time they sign in.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates",
