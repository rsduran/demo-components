The wording is this: \"In order to make the process of recording attendance information more efficient, workers must create an attendance record for each child and add the child to the record.\"  \n\nThis to me suggests that they are NOT creating the new Attendance records from the Child record.  In fact, it suggests they probably either use a quick create form from anywhere in the system OR perhaps sitting on the Child Attendance record list and clicking New each time a drop off happens, and then manually setting the Child lookup in either case.  If this assumption is correct, then field mappings are NOT helpful, but Business Rules would be!  A workflow is another possibility but I think they are looking for BRs here."
