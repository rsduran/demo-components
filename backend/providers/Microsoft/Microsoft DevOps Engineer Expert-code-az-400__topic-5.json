High code coupling can make it difficult to change or modify the system, as any changes to one part of the system may require changes to other parts of the system.\n\nDependency cycles are situations where two or more parts of a software system depend on each other. Dependency cycles can make it difficult to understand the system and can lead to problems when changes are made.\n\nBy reducing code coupling and dependency cycles, you can make the software system easier to understand and change. This can help to reduce the time it takes to add new features and can improve the overall quality of the system."

Technical debt can occur when developers take shortcuts, such as copying and pasting code or creating dependencies between different parts of the codebase. This can lead to an accumulation of technical debt over time, which makes it harder to add new features or make changes to the existing codebase.\n\nReducing code coupling and dependency cycles can help break down these dependencies and make the codebase more modular and easier to work with. By reducing code coupling, you can make it easier to modify specific parts of the codebase without affecting other parts. Similarly, by reducing dependency cycles, you can break down complex relationships between different parts of the codebase and make it easier to understand and modify the code."

It allows developers to define and automate the build process, including compiling the code, running tests, and generating artifacts such as JAR files. Gradle can also integrate with SonarQube, allowing developers to analyze and monitor the code quality of their Java projects.\n\nB. CocoaPods\n\nCocoaPods is a dependency manager for iOS projects and is not relevant for a Java solution.\n\nC. Grunt\n\nGrunt is a JavaScript task runner that is commonly used for automating front-end web development tasks. It is not relevant for a Java solution.\n\nD. Gulp\n\nGulp is another JavaScript task runner that is similar to Grunt, and is also not relevant for a Java solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Gradle, as it is the build automation tool commonly used in Java projects and can integrate with SonarQube for code analysis and monitoring."

Azure Artifacts allows you to host and share packages within your organization, making it a perfect choice for your use case.\n\nPublish a package: After creating the Azure Artifacts feed, the next step is to publish your NuGet package to this feed. You'll need to make sure you've properly configured your package for publishing, which includes providing the necessary metadata in the .nuspec file.\n\nConnect to an Azure Artifacts feed: Once the package is published, you or your development team will need to connect to the Azure Artifacts feed to consume the package. This typically involves adding the feed to your NuGet configuration in Visual Studio or another development environment.\n\nInstall a package: The final step in verifying that the package can be consumed is to actually install it. Using the NuGet CLI or the package management functionality in your development environment, you can install the package from the Azure Artifacts feed and confirm that it works as expected."

When the returns have diminished past a certain point, the test coverage can probably be scaled back.\n\nSince the scenario presented states that there is a large accumulated technical debt, I believe the answer is Yes for this case."

You can then in your server execute a Powershell script, but there is no way to guarantee it will execute before the rebase because as far as I know Github won't wait for the Powershell script to end execution because all Github does about it is to send the custom HTTP request. I don't know if Github waits for a response from the server after sending the request before proceeding, but if it isn't the case then it's impossible. Besides, I don't think there is a webhook for rebase events since rebases are made locally. You can configure a webhook for a push event, but not for rebase, that doesn't make sense."

Since the current version of App1 is 11.2.0, the new version, after the bug fix, should be 11.2.1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 11.2.1. Even though the bug was introduced in version 10.5.1, the version number should always be incremented from the current version, not the version where the bug was introduced. This is because the new release will also include all the changes made in versions after 10.5.1 up to the current version. Therefore, going back to a previous version number or creating a separate patch version for 10.5.1 would not be appropriate or in line with Semantic Versioning rules."

Proxying a private upstream MyGet package feed to your MyGet feed helps minimize the impact of upstream source availability issues. If the upstream source experiences downtime or availability issues, your local proxy can still serve packages from its cache, ensuring continuous availability to your team.\n\nC. Proxying provides automatic authentication. When you set up a proxy, it handles authentication with the upstream source on your behalf.

It stores the file contents in a separate backend (e.g., GitHub LFS servers), while only storing a pointer to the file within the Git repository itself. This significantly reduces the repository size and improves versioning performance. Associating the ZIP file extension with Git LFS ensures automatic handling of large files.\n\nAzure Storage with Blob Versions: This approach stores the actual 3GB ZIP file in Azure Storage, not the Git repository. By enabling blob versions, you maintain version history for the file, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. This solution keeps the Git repository lightweight while maintaining version control for the large file."
