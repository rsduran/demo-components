Each screen must ask for specific data from the guest. \nwhile you could make a self-service solution with canvas app, by putting some i pad in the lobby and ask the customer with a rude tone that he/she is obliged to make the work by himself. you may better seduce the customer to fill an online form using power apps portal as it clearly states  'Guests must create an account and sign into a resort portal' the alpine ski house commands the guest MUST (rude!)...,  joking...\ni guess if ever the customer was not behaving to the must requirement, some hotel staff then onpremises will use power apps mobile app."
