In this case, the DNS zone being marked as \"degraded\" suggests an issue with the configuration.\n\nHere are the two options that could potentially cause this issue:\n\nB. The zone contains only name server delegation records. This suggests that the DNS zone is not hosting any actual records for the domain itself, but is merely delegating to other DNS servers. A DNS zone with only NS records might not be serving its intended purpose, leading Azure to mark it as \"degraded.\"\n\nE. The zone is empty. This means that the DNS zone does not contain any DNS records, including essential ones like A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, or even NS records. An empty DNS zone serves no practical function and would also be marked as \"degraded\" by Azure.\n\nPlease note that the presence of A records, MX records, or glue records (Options A, C, and D) should not cause a DNS zone to be marked as \"degraded.\" In fact, these types of records are typically necessary for a properly functioning DNS zone."

The passwords for the local administrator accounts are stored in the key vaults. You grant the team that initiates the deployment the Reader RBAC role to all key vaults.<br>\u2022 You deploy a multi-tier SharePoint Server environment into a subnet in VNet2. You implement network security groups (NSGs) to allow only specific ports between tiers in the subnet. You configure NSGs to use application security groups (ASGs) when designating the source and destination of cross-tier traffic.<br>\u2022 You deploy a secondary multi-tier SharePoint Server environment into a subnet in VNet3.<br>You create the following resources:<br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/az-720/image6.png\"><br><br>Issues -<br><br>DNS issues -<br><br>Reverse DNS lookup -<br>\u2022 Reverse DNS lookups from VNet1 return two records.

The gap should be less than one minute.\n\nIf the connection isn't restored after the first reboot, issue the same command again to reboot the second VM instance (the new active gateway). If the two reboots are requested back to back, there will be a slightly longer period where both VM instances (active and standby) are being rebooted.
