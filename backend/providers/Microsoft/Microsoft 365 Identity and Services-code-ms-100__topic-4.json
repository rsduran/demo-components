Pass-through Authentication and federation rely on on-premises infrastructure. For pass-through authentication, the on-premises footprint includes the server hardware and networking the Pass-through Authentication agents require. For federation, the on-premises footprint is even larger. It requires servers in your perimeter network to proxy authentication requests and the internal federation servers.\n\nPTA is more available than Federated, and PHS is more available than PTA - but at the same time, if this question is poorly worded and storing the hash in the cloud is considered as storing the password in the cloud, then PTA with SSSO would be the answer."
