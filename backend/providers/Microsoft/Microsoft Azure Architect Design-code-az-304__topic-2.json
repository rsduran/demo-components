The assigned permission allows the granted identity to get access to the share only, nothing else, not even the root directory. You still need to separately configure directory or file-level permissions for Azure file shares.\n\nConfigure directory or file-level permissions for Azure Files\nAzure file shares enforce standard Windows file permissions at both the directory and file level, including the root directory. Configuration of directory or file-level permissions is supported over both SMB and REST. Mount the target file share from your VM and configure permissions using Windows File Explorer, Windows icacls, or the Set-ACL command."

There are two main approaches to authorization: role-based and resource-based.

But they are different: Application Gateway works in OSI layer 7 , Load Balancer works in OSI Layer 4 and Traffic Manager works with DNS. So, the only that verify the requirement (load-balance at level 7) is Azure Application Gateway\n\n2) Features are Web Application Firewall, SSL-Offloading and url-content routing. Obviusly, the only to protect against SQLInjections is Firewall (ssl-offloading is to manage https request) so the answer is Web Applicaton Firewall.\n\nBy the way, there is another one Load Balancer, named Azure Front Door, that works in OSI level 7, too. \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/ag-overview"

    "answerDescription": "Box 1: Create a system-assigned Managed Identities for Azure resource<br>The managed identities for Azure resources feature in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) feature provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.<br>A system-assigned managed identity is enabled directly on an Azure service instance. When the identity is enabled, Azure creates an identity for the instance in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription of the instance. After the identity is created, the credentials are provisioned onto the instance.<br>Box 2: An Azure Instance Metadata Service Identity<br>See step 3 and 5 below.<br>How a system-assigned managed identity works with an Azure VM<br>1. Azure Resource Manager receives a request to enable the system-assigned managed identity on a VM.<br>2. Azure Resource Manager creates a service principal in Azure AD for the identity of the VM. The service principal is created in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription.<br>3. Azure Resource Manager configures the identity on the VM by updating the Azure Instance Metadata Service identity endpoint with the service principal client<br>ID and certificate.<br>4. After the VM has an identity, use the service principal information to grant the VM access to Azure resources. To call Azure Resource Manager, use role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure AD to assign the appropriate role to the VM service principal. To call Key Vault, grant your code access to the specific secret or key in Key Vault.<br>5. Your code that's running on the VM can request a token from the Azure Instance Metadata service endpoint, accessible only from within the VM<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview",

These conditional rules may allow or block access or be more refined by allowing access only of you meet certain criteria (MFA)\n\nIn AAD IP - the only thing you can set is the MFA registration policy which is a global setting but does not correlate to controlled access to any specific part of Azure Portal or App."

Option1) is simplest and we are talking about a single organization albeit two divisions - there may never be more than one extra tenant and multitenant conversion would be overkill, so my answer would be C).

It also helps you monitor network connectivity to service and application endpoints and monitor the performance of<br>Azure ExpressRoute.<br>Note:<br>IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen,<br>IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.<br>IP flow verify looks at the rules for all Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to the network interface, such as a subnet or virtual machine NIC. Traffic flow is then verified based on the configured settings to or from that network interface. IP flow verify is useful in confirming if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview",
