In this case the answer could be:\nYes- because a desktop shortcut to an existent app on the computers would sync. But not a shortcut to a file.\nYes- Because settings on the desktop are synced.\nNo- Because User2 is in GroupB.\nAnyway, I don't believe this kind of question would appear on the exam from May 3rd, 2022 because user profiles is excluded.
