    "answerDescription": "Azure Functions can run on either a Consumption Plan or a dedicated App Service Plan. If you run in a dedicated mode, you need to turn on the Always On setting for your Function App to run properly. The Function runtime will go idle after a few minutes of inactivity, so only HTTP triggers will actually \"wake up\" your functions. This is similar to how WebJobs must have Always On enabled.<br>Scenario: Notification latency: Users report that anomaly detection emails can sometimes arrive several minutes after an anomaly is detected.<br>Anomaly detection service: You have an anomaly detection service that analyzes log information for anomalies. It is implemented as an Azure Machine Learning model. The model is deployed as a web service.<br>If an anomaly is detected, an Azure Function that emails administrators is called by using an HTTP WebHook.<br>References:<br>https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/wiki/Enable-Always-On-when-running-on-dedicated-App-Service-Plan",
