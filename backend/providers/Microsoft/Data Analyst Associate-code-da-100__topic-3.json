Change the dashboard view to Phone view: This activates the phone view mode specifically designed for mobile phone portrait orientation.\n4. Rearrange, resize, or remove items from the phone view: In this view, you can customize the layout for mobile users by rearranging the visuals, resizing them to fit the screen, or removing any that might not be essential for the mobile view.\n\nImportance\n- You can't rearrange or resize items unless they're already pinned to the dashboard.\n- Switching to phone view first wouldn't allow you to pin items because the phone view focuses on customizing existing dashboard elements."
