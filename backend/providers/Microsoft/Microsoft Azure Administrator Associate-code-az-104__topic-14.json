Unfortunately, my colleague encountered case studies at the end, which s*cks..\nAlso, they changed order of questions for case studies.\n\nA big thanks to the one and only mlantonis, the legend, who brought light into darkness on several occasions.\n\nIt took us around one month of intensive studying as novices.
