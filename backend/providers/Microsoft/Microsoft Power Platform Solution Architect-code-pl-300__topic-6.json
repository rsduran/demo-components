Fast response time is a hard requirement and it's sure that Import mode delivers that better than DirectQuery.\nI am no expert on Composite but I would argue that in the best case, it's as fast as Import mode. In Composite mode, some tables might switch to DirectQuery due to the user behaviour, but that would mean we would overachieve the requirement for daily refreshing, buying this overachievement through slower response time.
