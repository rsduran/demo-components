No. The recommendation to use k=3 is a common practice in k-fold cross-validation, but it may not necessarily satisfy the requirements in every case. It depends on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the data sample.\n\nFor example, if the data sample is small, using k=3 may not provide enough training data for the model to learn from, resulting in a high variance in the evaluation metric. In this case, a larger value of k may be more appropriate. On the other hand, if the data sample is very large, using k=3 may result in a low bias but high variance, in which case a smaller value of k may be more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, it's important to consider the specific requirements and characteristics of the task and data sample when choosing the value of k for k-fold cross-validation. In general, the recommendation to use k=3 is a good starting point, but it may not always be the best choice."

This can help maintain the integrity of your dataset and ensure that your machine learning model receives meaningful input data.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the choice of replacement strategy can also depend on the nature of your data and the specific requirements of your machine learning problem.

The service allows users to write and execute Python (among other languages) code in their browsers without the need for any configuration or installation of software on the local machine. This makes it an ideal solution for scenarios where learners do not have administrator permissions to install software and cannot access Azure subscriptions directly. Azure Notebooks support data visualization libraries in Python, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly, making it suitable for the practical training aimed at acquainting learners with data visualization creation."

You have to add L1/L2 regularization and make use of training data augmentation.\nOverfitting occurs when a model is too complex for data it is being trained on and memorizes the training data instead of generalizing to new data. To reduce overfitting, you can use regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, which add a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the model from learning overly complex representations. Additionally, increasing the amount of training data can also help reduce overfitting by giving the model more information to learn from. One common way to increase the amount of training data is to use data augmentation, which involves transforming the existing data in ways that preserve the labels to generate additional training examples."

One way to minimize overfitting is to add regularization to the model, which adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging the model to choose simpler solutions.\n\nL1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages the model from using large weights in the network. This has the effect of reducing the complexity of the model and can help prevent overfitting.\n\nData augmentation is another effective technique to minimize overfitting. It involves applying random transformations to the training data, such as random rotations or translations, to create new training examples that are similar to the original ones. This helps the model to generalize better to unseen data."

As I explained before, Azure Machine Learning designer requires either a compute instance or a compute cluster as the compute type12. Attached compute is a compute resource that you already have and can connect to your Azure Machine Learning workspace3. It can be a remote VM, an Azure Databricks cluster, an Azure HDInsight cluster, or an Azure Data Lake Analytics account3. However, these compute types are not compatible with Azure Machine Learning designer, which runs in a containerized environment and packages your model dependencies in a Docker container2. Therefore, you should create or use a compute instance or a compute cluster instead of attaching compute in Azure ML studio."
