This is because lock escalation is triggered when a single Transact-SQL statement acquires at least 5,000 locks on a single nonpartitioned table. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#lock-escalation)\nAs a result, if JobA starts first, JobB needs to wait untill the table lock is released.\n\nIn other words, we don't care about the fact that a row was locked. Since the records which are being deleted and the records being updated are different, this is not an issue. It becomes a problem only when JobA locks the table and we can see it when we use LockEscalation event class."

The value of the Account1Status and Account2Status columns are equal to one for active accounts. The following table displays selected columns and rows from the Customer table.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02829/0007200002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>You plan to create a view named Website.Customer and a view named Sales.FemaleCustomers.<br>Website.Customer must meet the following requirements:<br>\u2711 Allow users access to the CustomerName and CustomerNumber columns for active customers.<br>\u2711 Allow changes to the columns that the view references. Modified data must be visible through the view.<br>\u2711 Prevent the view from being published as part of Microsoft SQL Server replication.<br>Sales.Female.Customers must meet the following requirements:<br>\u2711 Allow users access to the CustomerName, Address, City, State and PostalCode columns.<br>\u2711 Prevent changes to the columns that the view references.<br>\u2711 Only allow updates through the views that adhere to the view filter.<br>You have the following stored procedures: spDeleteCustAcctRelationship and spUpdateCustomerSummary. The spUpdateCustomerSummary stored procedure was created by running the following Transacr-SQL statement:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02829/0007300007.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>You run the uspUpdateCustomerSummary stored procedure to make changes to customer account summaries. Other stored procedures call the spDeleteCustAcctRelationship to delete records from the CustomerToAccountBridge table.<br>When you start uspUpdateCustomerSummary, there are no active transactions. The procedure fails at the second update statement due to a CHECK constraint violation on the TotalDepositAccountCount column.<br>What is the impact of the stored procedure on the CustomerDetails table?<br>",

You can use this view to diagnose performance issues with the SQL Server session and also with specific queries and batches.<br>Note: SQL Server wait stats are, at their highest conceptual level, grouped into two broad categories: signal waits and resource waits.

A resource wait is accumulated by processes running on SQL Server which are waiting fora specific resource to become available, such as waiting for the release of a lock on a specific record.",

When this option is set to 1, the Database Engine stores a small compiled plan stub in the plan cache when a batch is compiled for the first time, instead of the full compiled plan. This helps to relieve memory pressure by not allowing the plan cache to become filled with compiled plans that are not reused.<br>* Cost Threshold for Parallelism<br>Use the cost threshold for parallelism option to specify the threshold at which Microsoft SQL Server creates and runs parallel plans for queries. SQL Server creates and runs a parallel plan for a query only when the estimated cost to run a serial plan for the same query is higher than the value set in cost threshold for parallelism. The cost refers to an estimated elapsed time in seconds required to run the serial plan on a specific hardware configuration.<br>5 means 5 seconds, but is is 5 seconds on a machine internal to Microsoft from some time in the 1990s. There's no way to relate it to execution time on your current machine, so we treat it as a pure number now.

    "answerDescription": "Snapshot isolation must be enabled by setting the ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON database option before it is used in transactions. This activates the mechanism for storing row versions in the temporary database (tempdb).<br>READ COMMITTED is the default isolation level for SQL Server. It prevents dirty reads by specifying that statements cannot read data values that have been modified but not yet committed by other transactions. Other transactions can still modify, insert, or delete data between executions of individual statements within the current transaction, resulting in non-repeatable reads, or \"phantom\" data.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: SERIALIZABLE is the most restrictive isolation level, because it locks entire ranges of keys and holds the locks until the transaction is complete. It encompasses REPEATABLE READ and adds the restriction that other transactions cannot insert new rows into ranges that have been read by the transaction until the transaction is complete.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/snapshot-isolation-in-sql-server",

Performance is often measured in terms of throughput rate or the number of rows loaded per second. The use of memory-optimized tables is well-suited for the ingestion of high-volume inserts because it prevents the bottlenecks commonly resulting from locking and eliminates logging. Consequently, the throughput rate (number of rows loaded per second) can substantially increase."

For non-partitioned tables it works like TABLE.<br>The DISABLE mode removes the lock escalation capability for the table and that is important when concurrency issues are more important than memory needs for specific tables.<br>Note: SQL Server's locking mechanism uses memory resources to maintain locks. In situations where the number of row or page locks increases to a level that decreases the server's memory resources to a minimal level, SQL Server's locking strategy converts these locks to entire table locks, thus freeing memory held by the many single row or page locks to one table lock. This process is called lock escalation, which frees memory, but reduces table concurrency.<br>References:<br>https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/2470/understanding-the-sql-server-nolock-hint/",

In addition, loading data to a [temporary table][Temporary] will also load much faster than loading a table to permanent storage.<br>A common pattern for data load is to load the data into a staging table, do some transformation and then load it into the target table using the following command<br>INSERT INTO &lt;columnstore index&gt;<br>SELECT &lt;list of columns&gt; FROM &lt;Staging Table&gt;<br>This command loads the data into the columnstore index in similar ways to BCP or Bulk Insert but in a single batch. If the number of rows in the staging table &lt;<br>102400, the rows are loaded into a delta rowgroup otherwise the rows are directly loaded into compressed rowgroup. One key limitation was that this INSERT operation was single threaded. To load data in parallel, you could create multiple staging table or issue INSERT/SELECT with non-overlapping ranges of rows from the staging table. This limitation goes away with SQL Server 2016 (13.x).

I may be missing something \n\nCross-Container Transaction\nA transaction is called a cross-container transaction if it:\n\nAccesses a memory-optimized table from interpreted Transact-SQL; or\nExecutes a native proc when a transaction is already open (XACT_STATE() = 1).\nThe term \"cross-container\" derives from the fact that the transaction runs across the two transaction management containers, one for disk-based tables and one for memory-optimized tables.\n\nWithin a single cross-container transaction, different isolation levels can be used for accessing disk-based and memory-optimized tables. This difference is expressed through explicit table hints such as WITH (SERIALIZABLE) or through the database option MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_ELEVATE_TO_SNAPSHOT, which implicitly elevates the isolation level for memory-optimized table to snapshot if the TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL is configured as READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED"
