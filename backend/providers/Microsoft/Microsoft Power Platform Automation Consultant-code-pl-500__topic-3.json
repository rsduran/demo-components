Typically, you use a cloned solution to ship a major update to the preceding solution.\" \n- Third answer: Import as managed as the users have mentioned.\n- Fourth answer: Upgrade\nI agree with charles879987 and the documentation that the clone a solution and the clone a patch are not recommended, but it does not mean that are prohibited to use them."

They extract, produce and transport oil. The company has more than 50 offices and 100 oil extraction facilities throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. They use railways, trucks, and pipelines to move oil and gas from their facilities.<br><br>The company provides the following services:<br><br>\u2022\tProduce oil from oil sands safely, responsibly, and reliably.<br>\u2022\tRefine crude oil into high-quality products.<br>\u2022\tDevelop and manage wind power facilities.<br>\u2022\tTransport oil to different countries/regions.<br><br>City Power and Light uses various Microsoft software products to manage its daily actives and run its machine-critical applications.<br><br><br>Requirements -<br><br><br>ManagePipelineMaintenanceTasks -<br>A user named Admin1 creates a cloud flow named ManagePipelineMaintenanceTasks. Admin1 applies a data loss prevention (DLP) policy to the flow. Admin1 shares the flow with a user named PipelineManager1 as co-owner. You must determine the actions that PipelineManager1 can perform.<br><br><br>MaintenanceScheduler -<br>You create a cloud flow that uses a desktop flow. The desktop flow connects to third-party services to fetch information. You must not permit the desktop flow to run for more than 20 minutes.<br><br>You must configure sharing for MaintenanceScheduler to meet the following requirements:<br><br>\u2022\tUser1 must be able to work with you to modify the desktop flow.<br>\u2022\tUser2 must be able to access and review the run history for the cloud flow.<br>\u2022\tYou must grant User3 permissions to run but not modify the desktop flow.<br><br><br>ERPDataOperations flow -<br>City Power and light uses an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The ERP system does not have an API.<br><br>Each day the company receives an email that contains an attachment. The attachment lists orders from the company\u2019s rail transportation partners. You must create an automation solution that reads the contents of the email and writes records to the ERP system. The solution must pass credential from a cloud flow to a desktop flow.<br><br><br>RailStatusUpdater -<br>City Power and Light actively monitors all products in transit. You must create a flow named RailStatusUpdater that manages communications with railways that transport the company\u2019s products. RailStatusUpdater includes five desktop flow actions.<br><br>You must run the desktop flows in attended mode during testing. You must run the desktop flows in unattended mode after you deploy the solution. You must minimize administrative efforts.<br><br><br>Packaging -<br>All flow automations must be created in a solution. All required components to support the flows must be included in the solution.<br><br><br>Issues -<br><br><br>ProductionMonitor flow -<br>You create a cloud flow named ProductionMonitor which uses the Manually trigger a flow trigger.

The company has 33 offices and 12 warehouses across the US, Mexico, and Canada. As their customers\u2019 needs grow in sophistication, Contoso wants to delight customers with breakthrough products, exceptional service, and on-time delivery of materials. They want to automate time consuming and manual processes that are prone to error. Contoso wants to consolidate and automate ordering and fulfillment processes.<br><br>\u2022\tThe company has a fleet of 500 delivery trucks. The company has 150 drivers and uses third-party contractors to deliver goods.<br>\u2022\tThe company has 400 warehouse workers and 30 finance clerks.<br>\u2022\tContoso has 85 sales representatives and 50 customer service representatives. Sales representatives spend most of their time on the road visiting customers or prospects.<br>\u2022\tThe IT department consists of four system administrators and six system analysts.<br><br><br>Current environment -<br><br><br>Overview -<br>Contoso Pharmaceuticals has a custom enterprise resource management (ERP) system. It is difficult to integrate other applications and services with the system. Office staff manually key in purchase orders, customer orders, and invoices after they receive a scan or hard copy of an agreement.<br><br><br>Applications -<br><br>\u2022\tThe company uses a custom supplier management system named SMSApps that runs on each user\u2019s workstation. The system is costly to run and maintain. SMSApp does not have an API.<br>\u2022\tSales representatives manage customer requests by using Dynamics 365 Sales.<br>\u2022\tContoso has Microsoft Power Platform development, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production environments.<br>\u2022\tAdministrators create one Accounts Payable (AP) mailbox for each environment to support testing.<br>\u2022\tThe use of a DLP policy and Desktop Flow development is specified as part of the automation requirements.<br><br><br>Security -<br>You assign all users one or more Microsoft Dataverse security roles.<br><br><br>Business Process -<br><br>1. Sales representatives create quotes by using a Microsoft Word document template. The template allows representatives to include product, quantity, and cost estimation details that will be needed to fulfil an order. The representative converts quotes to a PDF file and emails the file to the customer for approval.<br>2. The sales representative alerts the finance team about the new order and emails the finance team a copy of the quote for processing.<br>3. The finance team prints the quote and manually creates a purchase order (PO) into SMSApp to request materials from a known and trusted vendor.<br>4. The SMSApp distributes the PO to stakeholders. The system sends a copy to a shared finance team mailbox.<br>5. Once a PO is fulfilled by a vendor, the system sends an email to the finance mailbox. The finance team releases an order to the warehouse.<br>6. Materials are shipped from the vendor to one of Contoso\u2019s warehouses. Warehouse workers enter key information from the waybill into SMSApp. The materials are unloaded and racked in the warehouse until they are shipped to customers.<br>7. Upon checking for new daily orders in SMSApp, they see an open order is pending that is awaiting the newly received materials.<br>8. The Warehouse worker loads an order onto a truck for delivery and marks the order as complete in SMSApp.<br>9. Sales representatives provide fulfillment status and tracking information for orders.<br>10. A finance clerk prepares an invoice and sends the invoice to the customer by email. The clerk sends a copy of the email to the shared AP mailbox.<br>11.
