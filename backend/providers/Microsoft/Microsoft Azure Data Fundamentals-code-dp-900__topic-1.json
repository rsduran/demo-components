By the book, this would be correct for ELT but appears incorrect for ETL because the transformation process occurs in an isolated specialized engine prior to loading. However, in reality, a lot of older ETL routines are actually ELT based on their infrastructure. Therefore, I would be inclined to go for B. \nNonetheless another poorly chosen question though."

The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries.<br>Example:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04277/0001500001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Incorrect Answers:<br>The data in the question is not normalized.<br>The snowflake schema is a variation of the star schema, featuring normalization of dimension tables. Example:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04277/0001600001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Note: A snowflake schema is a logical arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database such that the entity relationship diagram resembles a snowflake shape. The snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact tables which are connected to multiple dimensions.[citation needed]. \"Snowflaking\" is a method of normalizing the dimension tables in a star schema. When it is completely normalized along all the dimension tables, the resultant structure resembles a snowflake with the fact table in the middle.<br><br>Box 2: dimension -<br>The star schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-overview https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_schema https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/data-models-within-azure-analysis-services-and-power-bi/",

This structure allows operations, such as directory renames and deletes, to be performed in a single atomic operation. Flat namespaces, by contrast, require several operations proportionate to the number of objects in the structure. Hierarchical namespaces keep the data organized, which yields better storage and retrieval performance for an analytical use case and lowers the cost of analysis.\n\nSOURCE: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-data-lake-storage/4-azure-data-lake-and-blob-storage"

This could be really beneficial in for example, banking sector.\nThe answer for 3 - Yes, and the reason is in ETL processes, one of the bottleneck was staging server compute which took a lot of time.

License mobility allows reassignment of their licenses to a partner's shared servers. You can use this benefit on Azure IaaS and AWS EC2.\n\nAzure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server differs from license mobility in two key areas:\n\nIt provides economic benefits for moving highly virtualized workloads to Azure. SQL Server Enterprise Edition customers can get four cores in Azure in the General Purpose SKU for every core they own on-premises for highly virtualized applications. License mobility doesn't allow any special cost benefits for moving virtualized workloads to the cloud."

This article summarizes the basics of the access control model for Data Lake Storage Gen2.\n\nACLs are applied on the file and folder level. The key thing to remember is that you are always going to need RBAC Control Plane permissions in combination with ACLs. Best practice is to assign your security principals RBAC Reader role on the Storage Account/Container level and continue with more restrictive ACLs on the file and folder level.\n\nThere are two types of ACLs:\n\nAccess ACLs: They control access to an object. An object can be a file or a folder.\n\nDefault ACLs: These are ACLs assigned on the folder level only which get inherited as Access ACLs by the child file or folder."

    "answerDescription": "A key mechanism that allows Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to provide file system performance at object storage scale and prices is the addition of a hierarchical namespace. This allows the collection of objects/files within an account to be organized into a hierarchy of directories and nested subdirectories in the same way that the file system on your computer is organized. With a hierarchical namespace enabled, a storage account becomes capable of providing the scalability and cost-effectiveness of object storage, with file system semantics that are familiar to analytics engines and frameworks.<br>One advantage of hierarchical namespace is atomic directory manipulation: Object stores approximate a directory hierarchy by adopting a convention of embedding slashes (/) in the object name to denote path segments.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace",

Here's a general outline of how you would query a graph database in Azure Cosmos DB using the Gremlin API:\n\nConnect to the Cosmos DB account: You would need to provide the connection details for your Azure Cosmos DB account, including the URI and authentication keys or tokens.\nInstantiate a Gremlin client: Use a Gremlin client library for your programming language of choice (e.g., Java, Python, .NET) to establish a connection to the Cosmos DB account.\nExecute Gremlin queries: Use the methods provided by the Gremlin client library to execute Gremlin queries against the graph database in Azure Cosmos DB. These queries can traverse the graph, retrieve vertices (nodes), edges (relationships), and perform various graph operations. Process the results returned by the Gremlin queries as needed for your application logic."

This allows the collection of objects/files within an account to be organized into a hierarchy of directories and nested subdirectories in the same way that the file system on your computer is organized. With a hierarchical namespace enabled, a storage account becomes capable of providing the scalability and cost-effectiveness of object storage, with file system semantics that are familiar to analytics engines and frameworks.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace",

Unlike in a relational database where the schema is predefined and structured, non-relational data allows for more flexibility in the structure and schema. Each entity can have its own set of properties and attributes, and the data itself carries information about its structure and meaning. This self-descriptive nature of non-relational data allows for dynamic and adaptable data models."

The integration runtime provides the compute environment for executing activities, which are the building blocks of data pipelines in Azure Data Factory.\n\nSSIS packages are a type of data integration solution that can be run on premises or in the cloud. They can be integrated with Azure Data Factory, but they are not a component of the Data Factory compute environment. A control flow is a logical representation of the steps that are required to execute a workflow, and a pipeline is a collection of activities that are organized into a workflow. While both of these components are important for building data pipelines in Azure Data Factory, they do not provide the compute environment for executing activities."

Transactions (updates) tend to be lots of writes and fewer reads and writes are more expensive because of ACID: so B with \"heavy writes and light reads\" (whatever \"heavy\" and \"light\" mean here and it's terminology that isn't used in the current DP-900). But, in fact, overall OLTP systems tend to have more reads than writes -- we look up more data than we change. Most of the other aswers relate to structured data, not to OLTP system -- semi-structured data is also used for OLTP (in fact, for online applications processing lots of transactions per seconds). Transactions/ACID still matters even in semi-structured database: You don't want to write out half a JSON document, for example...I suppose we could call what happens with semi-structured data, OLP. But the question confuses structured data with OLTP which are two different things and, I bet, this question is no longer in the exam pool."

The primary purpose of a data warehouse is to store historical data from multiple sources in a single location, in a format that makes it easy to query and analyze. This data is typically read-only, meaning that it is not intended for transactional use. Instead, it is used for reporting and analysis, such as generating business intelligence reports, performing data mining and modeling, and supporting decision-making processes. Data warehousing also includes transforming data from various sources into a consistent format, making it easy for users to query and analyze data from multiple systems."

Although its collecting and processing data once a day it's not the best answer, it's obvious that D will be the best answer for this question\nOption C is also wrong. It's real time so batch workloads won't work that way\nOption D is the correct answer it has the same explanation with Option B but option B only tells that batch workloads only happens a day well that's not always the case since batch workloads may vary on many things sometimes it can process the data after 12 hours, 1 week, 1 month or a certain amount of data workload which explains why there is a condition\nD is the right and the best answer"

Option D has best answer between the two why because there is condition that means that batch can collect and process data once a day (Which is the case for Option B), it can also happen not just by day, week or month it can work also with large volumes of data for example it will process the data once 100 transactions are met."

These key values are the columns included in the index definition. There can be only one clustered index per table, because the data rows themselves can be stored in only one order. \n\nThe only time the data rows in a table are stored in sorted order is when the table contains a clustered index.

This ensures that the database transitions from one valid state to another, maintaining the integrity of the data.\n\nIsolation: In a transactional database that guarantees isolation, processes can see only data in a consistent state.

This is because a transactional database follows the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensures that all transactions are executed in a reliable and consistent manner.\nWhen a transaction is executed, the database system ensures that all changes made to the data are logged in a transaction log. This log contains a record of all changes made during the transaction, including updates, inserts, and deletions. If any part of the transaction fails, the database system uses the transaction log to roll back the transaction and undo any changes that were made.\nBy logging all data changes, the database system can ensure that the data remains consistent and that no data is lost or corrupted. In addition, the transaction log provides a history of all changes made to the data, which can be used for auditing and troubleshooting purposes."

Each row represents a single record or entity, and each column represents a specific attribute or property of that record.\n\nKeys play a crucial role in establishing relationships between tables. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring its uniqueness and providing a way to reference that row from other tables. Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables by linking a column in one table to the primary key column in another table."
