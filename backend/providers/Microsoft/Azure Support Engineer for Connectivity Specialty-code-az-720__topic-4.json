        "content": "Correct.\n\nThe certificate mismatch error usually occurs when the name on the certificate doesn't match the name that the server expected. When you're setting up a VPN with Azure certificate for authentication type, the client verifies the server's identity by checking the server's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in the VPN client configuration against the name in the server certificate.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to manually create a profile, add the correct server FQDN to the profile, and then reissue the client certificate. This ensures that the name in the server certificate matches the server name that the VPN client expects."
