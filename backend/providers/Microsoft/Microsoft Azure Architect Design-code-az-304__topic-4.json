    "body": "DRAG DROP -<br>Your company identifies the following business continuity and disaster recovery objectives for virtual machines that host sales, finance, and reporting applications in the company's on-premises data center:<br>\u2711 The sales application must be able to fail over to a second on-premises data center.<br>\u2711 The finance application requires that data be retained for seven years. In the event of a disaster, the application must be able to run from Azure. The recovery time objective (RTO) is 10 minutes.<br>\u2711 The reporting application must be able to recover point-in-time data at a daily granularity. The RTO is eight hours.<br>You need to recommend which Azure services meet the business continuity and disaster recovery objectives. The solution must minimize costs.<br>What should you recommend for each application? To answer, drag the appropriate services to the correct applications. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.<br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br>Select and Place:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0019700004.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>",

With Azure Migrate you have the option to shutdown, then do a final delta to make sure you have everything without any loss of data. Here's my rational;\n\nThe AM, if you need to shutdown the VM to make sure you have all the data, that's not meeting the requirements of the question by experiencing no downtime. The downtime would come from having the VM's down while making that final sync happen. \n\nWith ASR the downtime isn't experienced since it's just shuffling the VM's to an alternate location without needing that extra shutdown step.\n\nJust my opinion on this."

An on-premises network gateway can exchange routes with an Azure virtual network gateway using the border gateway protocol (BGP). For expressroute, you must use BGP to advertise on-premises routes to the Microsoft Edge router. Do NOT be confused with this statement. It's traffic from on-prem to azure. You can use user-defined routes for forcing traffic from the Express Route to, for example, a Network Virtual Appliance. This one is for redirect traffic from Azure to on-prem then go to Internet. With the next hop type for the route with the 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix is Internet, the traffic will go to internet.\n\nref: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview"
