For example, you can specify a date range so that email or site documents that were created within the date ranged are placed on hold. A condition is logically connected to the keyword query (specified in the keyword box) by the AND operator.

This is because sensitive information types are used to define the pattern of sensitive data that needs to be protected. By creating a new sensitive information type that matches the label's encryption pattern, Outlook on the web will be able to recognize and apply the label.\n\nModifying the priority order of label policies (option A) or creating a label policy with Most Voted (option C) would not directly address the issue of Outlook on the web not being able to recognize the label. Waiting six hours (option B) is unlikely to resolve the issue and is not a proactive solution. Therefore, creating a new sensitive information type (option D) is the best solution to ensure that the label can be used to protect email messages in Outlook on the web."

If the user change shows no results, you already know it was a filter change, so an audit telling you only that it was a filter change and not what kind of change is not very helpful.

    "options": [],
    "answer": "See explanation below.",
    "answerDescription": "Creating Office 356 labels is a two-step process. The first step is to create the actual label which includes the name, description, retention policy, and classifying the content as a record. Once this is completed, the second step requires the deployment of a label using a labelling policy which specifies the specific location to publish and applying the label automatically.<br>To create an Office 365 label, following these steps:<br>1. Open Security and Compliance Centre;<br>2. Click on Classifications;<br>3. Click on Labels;<br>4. The label will require configuration including: name your label (Name), add a description for the admins (Description for Admins), add a description for the users<br>(Description for Users);<br>5. Click Next once the configuration is completed;<br>6. Click Label Settings on the left-hand side menu;<br>7. The Label Settings will need to be configured. On this screen, you can toggle the Retention switch to either \u05d2\u20acon\u05d2\u20ac or \u05d2\u20acoff\u05d2\u20ac. If you choose \u05d2\u20acon\u05d2\u20ac, then you can answer the question \u05d2\u20acWhen this label is applied to content\u05d2\u20ac with one of two options. The first option is to Retain the Content. From the pick boxes, you can choose the length of retention and upon the end of the retention, the action that will take place. The three actions are to delete the data, trigger an approval flow for review, or nothing can be actioned. The second option is to not retain the data after a specified amount of time or based on the age of the data; and<br>8. The label has now been created.<br>To create a label policy, follow these steps:<br>1. Open Security and Compliance Centre;<br>2. Click on Data Governance, Retention;<br>3. Choose Label Policies box at the top of the screen; and<br>4. There are now two options. The first is to Publish Labels. If your organization wants its end users to apply the label manually, then this is the option you would choose. Note that this is location based. The second option is to Auto-apply Labels. With Auto-apply, you would have the ability to automatically apply a label when it meets the specified criteria.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.maadarani.com/office-365-classification-and-retention-labels/",

It works by monitoring user activities and authentication events in your organization's Active Directory environment. It does not provide information on the cloud apps accessed from the computers.\n\nTo discover which cloud apps are accessed from the computers, you should use Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) which is part of Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. MCAS provides visibility into the cloud apps accessed from your network and allows you to control access to those apps. You can use MCAS to discover cloud apps that are used in your organization and identify potential risks associated with those apps. To do this, you need to configure MCAS to collect logs from the firewall that utilizes syslog and analyze those logs to identify the cloud apps accessed from the computers."
