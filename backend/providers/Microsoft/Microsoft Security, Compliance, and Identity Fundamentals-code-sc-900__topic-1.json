It is used to authenticate the application to access resources, and also to assign permissions to those resources.\n\nA service principal is like a user identity (login and password or certificate) for an application.\n\nAn application object, on the other hand, is a representation of an application in Azure Active Directory. It contains information about the application, such as its name and URL, as well as its associated service principal.\n\nIn summary, a service principal is a security identity used to authenticate an application, while an application object is a representation of the application in Azure Active Directory that contains information about the application and its associated service principal."

Some Azure resources, such as virtual machines allow you to enable a managed identity directly on the resource. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity:\n- A service principal of a special type is created in Azure AD for the identity. The service principal is tied to the lifecycle of that Azure resource. When the Azure resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the service principal for you.\n- By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Azure AD.\n- You authorize the managed identity to have access to one or more services.\n- The name of the system-assigned service principal is always the same as the name of the Azure resource it is created for. For a deployment slot, the name of its system-assigned identity is &lt;app-name&gt;/slots/&lt;slot-name&gt;."

Azure Firewall is a cloud-native stateful firewall as a service that can be deployed in your virtual networks or in Azure Virtual WAN hub deployments for filtering traffic flowing between cloud resources, the Internet, and on-premises. You can create rules or policies specifying allow/deny traffic using layer 3 to layer 7 controls. You can also filter traffic going to the internet using both Azure Firewall and third parties by directing some or all traffic through third-party security providers for advanced filtering and user protection. This can help to improve the security of your SharePoint Online deployment by providing an additional layer of protection against web attacks and simplifying security management without requiring any application changes."

Remediation is accomplished through remediation tasks that deploy the deployIfNotExists template or the modify operations of the assigned policy on your existing resources and subscriptions, whether that assignment is on a management group, subscription, resource group, or individual resource. \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview\nAzure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to the per-resource, per-policy granularity. It also helps to bring your resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources."

A playbook can help automate and orchestrate your response, and can be set to run automatically when specific alerts or incidents are generated, by being attached to an analytics rule or an automation rule, respectively. It can also be run manually on-demand.\n\nPlaybooks in Microsoft Sentinel are based on workflows built in Azure Logic Apps, which means that you get all the power, customizability, and built-in templates of Logic Apps. Each playbook is created for the specific subscription to which it belongs, but the Playbooks display shows you all the playbooks available across any selected subscriptions."

These six elements are the foundational pillars of the Zero Trust model:\n- Identities may be users, services, or devices. When an identity attempts to access a resource, it must be verified with strong authentication, and follow least privilege access principles.\n- Data should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes. Security efforts are ultimately about protecting data, and ensuring it remains safe when it leaves devices, applications, infrastructure, and networks that the organization controls.\n- Networks should be segmented, including deeper in-network micro segmentation. Also, real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should be employed."

For example, protecting information at rest using encryption is a preventative action against attacks and breaches. Separation of duties is a preventative action to manage conflict of interest and guard against fraud.\n\nDetective actions actively monitor systems to identify irregular conditions or behaviors that represent risk, or that can be used to detect intrusions or breaches.

Deploying multiple virtual networks allows these policies to be enforced effectively by isolating resources into separate networks.\n\nD. to isolate the resources: By deploying multiple virtual networks, you can isolate different sets of resources from each other. This isolation enhances security by limiting the impact of potential security breaches or failures to specific sets of resources. It also allows for better network performance and resource management by reducing broadcast traffic and network congestion."

Specific to your organization and business needs, you can create categories for different levels of sensitive content in your organization.
