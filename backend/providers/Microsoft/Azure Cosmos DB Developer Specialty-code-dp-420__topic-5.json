The properties aren't incrementally added. A common misunderstanding is to think properties that aren't specified in the template are left unchanged. If you don't specify certain properties, Resource Manager interprets the deployment as overwriting those values. Properties that aren't included in the template are reset to the default values. Specify all non-default values for the resource, not just the ones you're updating. The resource definition in the template always contains the final state of the resource.

This property is used to specify the Azure AD identities (service principals) that are allowed to access the account.\n\nBy assigning a user-assigned identity to the userAssignedIdentities property, you can configure the apps to authenticate using that identity, which will enable them to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account. This ensures that only the specified Azure AD identities are allowed to access the account, providing a more secure authentication mechanism compared to using the secondary key.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. userAssignedIdentities."

This means that only Azure AD identities (service principals) will be able to authenticate and access the account.\n\nOn the other hand, the userAssignedIdentities property is used to specify the Azure AD identities that are allowed to access the account. While it can also be used to enforce authentication through Azure AD, it requires you to assign and manage user-assigned identities explicitly.\n\nIn the context of the given scenario, if you want to ensure that only Azure AD identities can connect to the account, the most direct and effective option would be to disable local authentication by setting disableLocalAuth to true.\n\nTherefore, the most correct answer in this case would be B. disableLocalAuth."
