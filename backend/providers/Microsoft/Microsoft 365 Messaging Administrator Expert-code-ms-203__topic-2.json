Is completely natural to search in the EAC first to see if the mail user is there, and if not, then move to check if there is any problem with the synchronization of the user. But we can only choose one, and the question states that \"User1 was not found\" from the NDR message. With this information it is redundant to check the EAC for the User1, because if a mail user exists in Exchange Online for User1 the NDR message should not be the one mentioned.
