        "content": "Gateway mode is supported on all SDK platforms. If your application runs within a corporate network with strict firewall restrictions, gateway mode is the best choice because it uses the standard HTTPS port and a single DNS endpoint. The performance tradeoff, however, is that gateway mode involves an additional network hop every time data is read from or written to Azure Cosmos DB. We also recommend gateway connection mode when you run applications in environments that have a limited number of socket connections.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/sdk-connection-modes#available-connectivity-modes"
