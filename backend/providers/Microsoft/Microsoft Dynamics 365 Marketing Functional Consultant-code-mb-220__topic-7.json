Analyzing the 4 answers they fall in 2 sets: one deals with the identification of festivals and the other addresses the conditions built on this identification (not mentioning how this might affect duplicate confirmation). Best is to pick one answer from each set, where a boolean is obviously the wrong thing but add another Event type is correct. If you want to have ONE generic confirmation journey to send for each type of Event type a specific confirmation, then the attribute on event type is the best way (maybe the root cause was several confirmation journeys by event type instead of one journey).
