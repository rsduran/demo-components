From DashboardA, select the TileA options and then select View Insights\nOnce, you have done that, you will see other visuals being generated that are related to the data displayed by Tile A, therefore the 2nd option should be to go through each of those visuals separately in Focus mode:\n2. From Focus mode, review the generated visuals\nLastly, once you have decided which are the further visuals you want to add to DashboardA, you need to pin those visuals there, so the third step is:\n3.From Focus mode, pin the relevant visuals to DashboardA."

However, if you calculate the total sales for the same day by adding up the sales from all transactions, the range may be much wider, say from $1,000 to $10,000, with the 40th percentile being $3,000. While both percentiles represent the same percentage of the total sales or transactions, the 40th percentile of daily sales may be a better indicator of the typical or median level of sales for that day, as it takes into account the variability and distribution of sales across individual transactions.\n\nTherefore, when adding a percentile line to a visualization, it's important to consider which measure and which percentile are most relevant and informative for the specific context and analysis, and to use the appropriate function (e.g., PERCENTILEX.INC or PERCENTILEX.EXC) to calculate the percentile based on the desired interpretation and inclusion/exclusion of values."

It is commonly used to explore data and identify trends and patterns in the data. The visual consists of nodes that represent different data points, with the root node at the top and the child nodes branching out from it. The size and color of the nodes can be used to represent different data values or categories.\n\nThe exhibit in the question shows a visual with multiple nodes that can be expanded or collapsed to reveal more detailed data. This is consistent with the behavior of a decomposition tree visual, which allows users to drill down into the data to explore it in more detail."

Pin a card visual to a dashboard and set an alert on the tile.\n\nTo be notified when the temperature rises above four degrees Celsius, you can pin a card visual showing the temperature to a dashboard and set an alert on the tile. To do this, first create the card visual on the report page showing the temperature data, then click on the \"Pin visual\" button in the top right corner of the visual and select the dashboard where you want to pin it. Once the card is pinned, click on the ellipsis menu in the top right corner of the tile and select \"Set alert\". From there, you can configure the alert settings to notify you when the temperature rises above four degrees Celsius. This solution allows you to receive notifications without having to constantly monitor the report or dashboard, and provides a targeted alert specific to the temperature data you're interested in.\n\nNo confusion, no need to discuss further"

If you select any columns/cells it will not affect any other visual (this is a drill through filter that the question wants not to affect other visuals. But the question says also it must change the other visual when you select a cell. So then, if you turn off the drill mode off and then select a cell, it will cross highlight/filter the other visuals depending on the interaction settings.
