Self-service maintenance is currently not available for Cloud Services (Web/Worker Role) and Service Fabric.\"\n\nThis makes me wonder if they are actually trying to ask about immediately doing the maintenance and redeploying your VM, rather than waiting. Just redeploying it using the manner in the question will not avoid the maintenance problem,  since it will redeploy in the same region that is scheduled for maintenance.  It might very well still be scheduled for maintenance after redeploying this way.  Instead, by using the \"Start now\" in the maintenance status will do the maintenance now and redeploy the VM, and thus avoid the problem.  Thus, the correct answer is no."
