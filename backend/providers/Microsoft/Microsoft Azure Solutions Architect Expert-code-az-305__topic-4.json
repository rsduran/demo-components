It detects when a Web App is stopped and started. This status is reflected in the endpoint status and When the underlying service is stopped, Traffic Manager doesn't do endpoint health checks or direct traffic to the endpoint and hence meets the requirements. -CHEAPER than FD\n\nYes Frontdoor would also work but you would NOT need the request routing method, it uses routing rules and Endpoint at layer 7. Also FD i used only If you need to optimize global routing of your web traffic and optimize top-tier end-user performance and reliability through quick global failover - EXPENSIVE"

Request routing configuration: c. Priority Traffic Routing\nTo ensure that users access the web app from the North Europe region unless it fails, use priority traffic routing. With priority routing, you can assign a priority value to each endpoint, and Traffic Manager routes the traffic to the endpoint with the highest priority available. In this case, assign a higher priority to the North Europe region, and a lower priority to the West Europe region. This will ensure that users are directed to the North Europe region as long as it is available, and to the West Europe region in case of a failure."

By keeping the Gateway Subnet distinct from both the Azure VMs subnet and the on-premises IP address space, you can avoid any potential routing issues and ensure proper communication between the on-premises network and Azure through a site-to-site VPN."

The template gets used for deployments of one or more Azure resources, but once those resources deploy there's no active connection or relationship to the template.\nWith Azure Blueprints, the relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was deployed) is preserved. This connection supports improved tracking and auditing of deployments.

Typically, the socket IP address is the IP address of the user, but it might also be the IP address of a proxy server or another device that sits between the user and Front Door. By using the web application firewall (WAF) with Azure Front Door, you can mitigate some types of denial of service attacks. Rate limiting also protects you against clients that have accidentally been misconfigured to send large volumes of requests in a short time period.\n\nRate limits are applied at the socket IP address level. If you have multiple clients accessing your Front Door from different socket IP addresses, they'll each have their own rate limits applied. The socket IP address is the source IP address WAF sees.

Create a render farm that uses virtual machine scale sets, which will enable the deployment and management of a large number of identical virtual machines, and allow for automatic scaling based on the workload.\n\nD. Create a render farm that uses Azure Batch, which provides a platform for running large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs. It can also automatically scale the number of nodes based on the workload and provides easy integration with Azure storage.\n\nTherefore, the recommended solution would be to create a render farm that uses virtual machine scale sets and Azure Batch in Azure to perform the 3D geometry calculations. This solution will ensure that each node can communicate with every other node, maximize the number of nodes to calculate multiple scenes as fast as possible, and minimize the amount of effort to implement the solution."

The cluster autoscaler component can watch for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When issues are detected, the number of nodes in a node pool is increased to meet the application demand. Nodes are also regularly checked for a lack of running pods, with the number of nodes then decreased as needed. This ability to automatically scale up or down the number of nodes in your AKS cluster lets you run an efficient, cost-effective cluster."

With the introduction of Azure Availability Zones, SQL Database can place different replicas of the Business Critical database to different availability zones in the same region. To eliminate a single point of failure, the control ring is also duplicated across multiple zones as three gateway rings (GW). The routing to a specific gateway ring is controlled by Azure Traffic Manager (ATM). Because the zone-redundant configuration in the Premium or Business Critical service tiers doesn't create additional database redundancy, you can enable it at no extra cost.

A session is a sequence of ordered messages. All messages in a session are handled in the order they arrive.

There are no such features as custom metadata setting or stored access policy that can establish FIFO in Azure Storage queues.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while partitioning in Azure Service Bus can improve performance by spreading the load across multiple message brokers and stores, it doesn't enforce FIFO ordering across partitions. FIFO ordering is maintained within a partition, but not across partitions. Hence, for strict FIFO, you would not want to enable partitioning, you would want to use sessions."

It supports both longer execution times and event-driven scaling, which are the requirements specified in the question. \n\nAzure Functions on a Premium plan can run for a longer period, up to 60 minutes (or indefinitely if the host.json \"functionTimeout\" setting is null), making it suitable for the estimated request processing times of five to 20 minutes. The Premium plan also supports event-driven autoscaling.\n\nThe Consumption plan supports event-driven autoscaling but only allows functions to run for up to 10 minutes, so it wouldn't support the estimated request processing times of five to 20 minutes. \n\nThe Dedicated and App Service plans can run for a longer period, but they do not support event-driven autoscaling. The Dedicated plan is also the most costly option and should be used when you need the most control over the function app environment."

This ensures that each region has a local connection point, reducing latency. Even though connections are optimized across three regions, the fourth hub is necessary to provide a local connection point in the fourth region.\n\nSo, while three hubs might seem sufficient based on one requirement, considering all requirements makes it clear that four hubs are needed.

Messages can be placed into a queue, where another service can pick them up and process them, which is exactly what's described in the scenario.

The B-series are burstable VMs that accumulate CPU credits during idle times and then consume these credits during periods of high CPU usage. This matches well with your requirement to minimize costs by accumulating CPU credits during periods of low utilization.

This capability isn't strictly a PaaS, but it's the type of management feature found in PaaS.There's a tradeoff between control and ease of management. IaaS gives the most control, flexibility, and portability, but you have to provision, configure, and manage the VMs and network components you create hence is very administrative intense. Also application composition is AGNOSTIC hence more complex for this scenario\n\nSo based on the above App services is winner (B)"
