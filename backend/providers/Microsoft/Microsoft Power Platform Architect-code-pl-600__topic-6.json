Power Apps Maker portal allows for the creation and customization of apps, forms, and workflows without requiring extensive coding knowledge. It can be used to create a user-friendly interface for inspectors to use when completing the checklists. Additionally, it allows for the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors and provides a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. It also supports the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections."

Each quality check will be different, so it would be a single record with multiple questions, linked to a single inspection record, which would be.....weird. 1:1.\n\nI therefore think the inspection record and all checklist items must be on a single record, and then a business rule should do it."

While it can be used for IoT solutions, it is more focused on providing a complete IoT application platform rather than just handling device-to-cloud communication. In this case, the requirement is to input measurement readings from inspection gauges, which can be more efficiently achieved using Azure IoT Hub connector, which is specifically designed for device-to-cloud communication."
