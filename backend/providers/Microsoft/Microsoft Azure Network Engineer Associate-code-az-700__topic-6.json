But , this is talking about if we have only in place express route Direct. For the other options express route, it's not available yet and still it on public review. The case study says that they want to minimize costs..so having an express route direct circuit is not the best idea.  However, by adding express route Ultra performance gateway , we can say that we can afford express route direct .. .. cheapest solution would be to add the vm2 traffic directly through the express route circuit... But , once again it's tricky... I will take the Risk and select the option of enabling gateway transit ."
