The PivotChart report shows data series, categories, data markers, and axes in the same way as the standard charts do. It is possible to change the chart type and other options such as titles, legend placement, data labels, and chart location.<br>Answer option A is incorrect. Stand-alone slicers are referenced from Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) Cube functions. These stand-alone slicers can be connected with any PivotTable in future.<br>They can be added by using the slicer button on the Ribbon. They need to be manually linked into grids as required.<br>Answer option C is incorrect.

He can attach an existing macro to a control, or write or record a new macro. These controls cannot be added to UserForms, used to control events, or modified to run Web scripts on Web pages.<br>Answer option B is incorrect. A PivotTable report is used to summarize large amounts of data, to analyze numerical data, and to answer unexpected questions about data.",

    "answerDescription": "The Failure to Look Up Values in Excel error occurs when a user gets an unexpected error while trying to look up or match a lookup_value within an array and<br>Excel is not able to recognize the matching value. If the lookup_value or the array the user is searching resides in a cell, the user can have unseen spaces at the start or end of that cell. This will create the situation where the contents of the two cells that the user is comparing look the same but extra spaces in one of the cells cause the cells to have slightly different content. The other reason is that the contents of the cells that are being compared may have different data types.<br>Answer option C is incorrect. The Lookup Function Won't Copy Down to Other Rows error occurs when a user uses a function in one cell and it works perfectly but when he attempts to copy the function down to other rows, he gets the #REF error. The #REF! error arises when Excel tries to reference an invalid cell. This error occurs if the user has referenced an entire worksheet by clicking on the grey square at the top left of the worksheet. For Excel, this reference range is 1 to<br>1048576. Since the references are Relative References, Excel automatically increases the row references when this cell is copied down to other rows in the spreadsheet.<br>Answer option D is incorrect. The Excel Won't Calculate My Function error occurs when a user types in a function and presses Enter, the cell shows the function as the user typed it, instead of returning the function's value. The reason that causes this problem is that the cells containing the formula are formatted as 'text' instead of the 'General' type. This happens when the user inserts a new column, next to a column that is already formatted as text due to which the new column inherits the formatting of the adjacent column.",

The other reason is that Excel is trying to show the contents of the cell as a date or time stored as positive numeric values within Excel, but the cell contains a negative value.<br>Answer option C is incorrect. The Failure to Look Up Values in Excel error occurs when a user gets an unexpected error while trying to look up or match a lookup_value within an array and Excel is not able to recognize the matching value. If the lookup_value or the array the user is searching resides in a cell, the user can have unseen spaces at the start or end of that cell. This will create the situation where the contents of the two cells that the user is comparing look the same but extra spaces in one of the cells cause the cells to have slightly different content. The other reason is that the contents of the cells that are being compared may have different data types. Answer option A is incorrect. The Excel Won't Calculate My Function error occurs when a user types in a function and presses Enter, the cell shows the function as the user typed it, instead of returning the function's value. The reason that causes this problem is that the cells containing the formula are formatted as 'text' instead of the 'General' type. This happens when the user inserts a new column, next to a column that is already formatted as text due to which the new column inherits the formatting of the adjacent column",

The Macro will be run in any worksheet of the Workbook.<br>4. A user can run the created Macro by using the shortcut key that he has specified while creating the Macro. The macro records the user's mouse clicks and keystrokes while he works and lets him play them back later. The macro can be used to record the sequence of commands that the user uses to perform a certain task. When the user runs the macro, it plays those exact commands back in the same order. Answer option C is incorrect. The benefit of connecting to external data from Microsoft Excel is that a user can automatically update Excel workbooks from the real data source whenever the data source is updated with new information. It is possible that the external data connection might be disabled on the computer. For connecting to the data source whenever a workbook is opened, it is required to enable data connections by using the Trust Center bar or by putting the workbook in a trusted location.",
