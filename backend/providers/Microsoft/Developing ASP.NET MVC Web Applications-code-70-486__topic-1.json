Application state is stored in memory on the server and is faster than storing and retrieving information in a database. Unlike session state, which is specific to a single user session, application state applies to all users and all sessions. Therefore, application state is a useful place to store small amounts of often-used data that does not change from one user to another. The topics in this section provide information on how application state works and how to use it.<br>SQL Database provides a relational database management system for Windows Azure and is based on SQL Server technology. With a SQL Database instance, you can easily provision and deploy relational database solutions to the cloud, and take advantage of a distributed data center that provides enterprise-class availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing.<br>References:<br>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/bf9xhdz4(v=vs.85).aspx",

Instead of assuming the identity of the user, the application uses its own credentials to access services and resources, but it captures the user's identity and passes it as a parameter (or token) to be used for authorization when a request is made. This model is referred to as the trusted subsystem model, because the application acts as a trusted subsystem within the security domain.",

It is not general rule but I have a feeling that assuming that there will be more than one may be good practice when taking MS exams.

Together with the [Authorize] attribute, you can now take a white-list approach instead. The white-list approach is accomplished by dressing the entire controller with the [Authorize] attribute, to force authorization for all actions within that controller. You can then dress specific actions, that shouldn't require authorization, with the [AllowAnonymous] attribute, and thereby white-listing only those actions. With this approach, you can be confident that you don't, by accident, forget to dress an action with the [Authorize], leaving it available to anyone, even though it shouldn't.<br>References:<br>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9727509/how-to-allow-an-anonymous-user-access-to-some-given-page-in-mvc",

Percentages are meant to be used when auto-scaling of the elements are expected. I doubt C is correct then.\n'Content must not scale when the device orientation changes.'\n\n* On the other hand it is expected that content should fulfill maximum available screen space. Then it has to be set to 100% somewhere. So in that case I had a feeling that B &amp; D may be correct answers here but...\n\n* Media queries are supported from IE9.

    "answerDescription": "How ASP.NET MVC applications can present mobile-specific pages<br>Since the Model-View-Controller pattern decouples application logic (in controllers) from presentation logic (in views), you can choose from any of the following approaches to handling mobile support in server-side code:<br>1. Create separate areas for desktop and mobile browsers, implementing independent controllers and views for each. This option works best if you're displaying very different screens, containing different information and leading the user through different workflows optimized for their device type. It may mean some repetition of code, but you can minimize that by factoring out common logic into an underlying layer or service.<br>2. Use the same controllers for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render different views depending on the device type. This option works best if you're displaying roughly the same data and providing the same workflows for end users, but want to render very different HTML markup to suit the device being used.<br>3. Use the same controllers and views for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render the views with different Razor layouts depending on the device type.<br>This option works best if you're displaying identical data on all devices, but simply want to supply different CSS stylesheets or change a few top-level HTML elements for mobiles.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/whitepapers/add-mobile-pages-to-your-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-application",
