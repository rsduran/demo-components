All the information captured is available in the App Center portal for you to analyze the data.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/#app-center-crashes\nApp Center Crashes will automatically generate a crash log every time your app crashes. The log is first written to the device's storage and when the user starts the app again, the crash log will be sent to App Center. Collecting crashes works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store or Google Play. Crash logs contain valuable information for you to help fix the crash."
