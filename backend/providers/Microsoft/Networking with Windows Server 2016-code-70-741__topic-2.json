To deploy Network Controller, you must install the Network Controller server role on a Hyper-V virtual machine (VM) that is installed on a Hyper-V host. After you have installed Network Controller on VMs on three different Hyper-V hosts, you must enable the Hyper-V hosts for Software Defined Networking (SDN) by adding the hosts to Network Controller using the Windows PowerShell command New-NetworkControllerServer. By doing so, you are enabling the SDN Software Load Balancer to function.
