The ONLY exception i.e. if you have IP address 192.168.33.45 rate limit of 50 and other IP 172.16.34.56 rate limit of 100 then definitely in that case you need to create 2 separate rules.

No\n\nThis solution does not fully meet the goal.\n\nAlthough creating a network security group (NSG) and associating it to Subnet1 is a step in the right direction for securing network traffic, simply associating an NSG to a subnet does not restrict outbound traffic from VM1 to the storage accounts.\n\nTo ensure that VM1 can access storage1 and is prevented from accessing any other storage accounts, you need to apply a specific set of rules to the NSG. One way to achieve this is by configuring the NSG to allow outbound traffic only to storage1 and deny outbound traffic to all other storage accounts.\n\nSo, to fully meet the goal, you need to create an NSG, associate it to Subnet1, and then configure appropriate rules in the NSG to allow traffic from VM1 to storage1 and block traffic to all other storage accounts."
