This is because a virtual network gateway can only be associated with one connection at a time.

Now to prevent vNET1 and vNET3 from accessing other resources such as internet or vms in vNET1 able to communicate with vms in vNET3 is to DISABLE GATEWAY TRANSIT.\n\nI believe some inform is missing in this question like address space, if vNETs in same region or not and in same subscription of not but assume simple scenario it is easier to create peering (Global reach Peering is also possible) than S2S for vNETS.

Therefore, the minimum number of circuits needed is two ExpressRoute Premium circuits.\n\nRegarding the minimum number of ExpressRoute gateways, at least one ExpressRoute gateway is required for each circuit.
