Additionally, the Azure Cognitive Search service supports full-text search, semantic search, vector search, and hybrid search, which aligns with your requirements for searching content in various formats, including video.\n\nRemember that the semantic search and vector search features are currently in public preview in Azure Cognitive Search.
