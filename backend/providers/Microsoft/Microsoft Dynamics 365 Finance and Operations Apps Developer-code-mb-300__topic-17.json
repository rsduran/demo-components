In this case, the street team needs to be able to create sales orders through their mobile application. By utilizing Dual Write, the sales order data entered in the mobile application can be seamlessly synchronized and integrated with the Dynamics 365 system, specifically with the Sales module. This ensures that the sales orders created by the street team are accurately captured and reflected in the overall sales process within Dynamics 365."
