This step involves adding the vendor's information to the system.\n\nAdd items, including quantity, to the lines: Once the vendor is added, you can create a purchase order. This step involves adding the specific items and their quantities that you want to purchase from the vendor.\n\nChange Purchase Order to a Status of Released: After adding items to the purchase order, you need to release it. This changes the status of the order to \"Released\", meaning that the purchase order is finalized and can be sent to the vendor.\n\nSelect Post &amp; Receive: After the goods are received from the vendor, you need to post the receipt and update the inventory. This action confirms the receipt of the items and updates the system accordingly."

Hence the original source of the item (aka the vendor) is of not important. The warehouse recievpt can be viewed as a substitute to the vendor in this case. \nIt would be very different if they dont have a warehouse but need to order what ever they are selling prior then the vendor is a needed information. \n\nThe question is comming up 1:1 this way earlier and the answer was  release -&gt; create wh recept --&gt; ad lines --&gt; post &amp; recieve. menaing if we beleive the answer given to the qustion is wrong here it will also be wrong for the other question.
