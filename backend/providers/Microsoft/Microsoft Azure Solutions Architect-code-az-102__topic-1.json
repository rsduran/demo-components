        "content": "According to the information provided, the Azure Migrate project has a comfort factor of 2.0 1. The comfort factor is used to calculate the number of CPU cores recommended for each virtual machine. The equation is: core usage x comfort factor 2.\n\nFor VM1, which has 10 CPU cores at 20% utilization, the effective utilized cores are 2 2. Multiplying this by the comfort factor of 2.0 gives us a recommended number of 4 CPU cores 2.\n\nFor VM2, which has 4 CPU cores at 50% utilization, the effective utilized cores are 2 2. Multiplying this by the comfort factor of 2.0 gives us a recommended number of 4 CPU cores 2.\n\nTherefore, Azure Migrate will recommend 4 CPU cores for each virtual machine 2."
