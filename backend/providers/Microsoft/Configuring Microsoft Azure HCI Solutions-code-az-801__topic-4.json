If your domain is built based on Windows server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2, you are already using DFS for SYSVOL replication. If you originally migrated from Windows server 2003, it's more likely you are still using FRS. In that case, before migration, you need to change the SYSVOL replication method from FRS to DFS.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.rebeladmin.com/2021/09/step-by-step-guide-active-directory-migration-from-windows-server-2008-r2-to-windows-server-2022/",
