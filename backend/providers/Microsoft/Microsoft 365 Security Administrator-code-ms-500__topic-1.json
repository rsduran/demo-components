The agent will still pick up their creds from the service bus. AAD users authenticate directly against AAD anyway so they can as well.  \nSecond Question  - Adding a second PTA authentication agent does fix the warning as everyone has said (tested). However, running start-AdSyncSyncCycle give an error if the AAD config wizard has been left open(the most likely problem and also tested) so only option 2 is correct."

When users sign in to Azure AD-connected applications, their passwords are validated against your on-premises Active Directory, so there's no need to store passwords in the cloud. Additionally, PTA supports the use of Azure AD Identity Protection risk policies, which help to detect and prevent risky sign-ins.\n\nThe other two authentication methods in Azure AD Connect are \"Password Hash Synchronization\" and \"Active Directory Federation Services\" (AD FS). While both of these methods are also compatible with Azure AD Identity Protection, PTA is the recommended method for its simplicity and security benefits.\n\nSo, you should select the \"Pass-through Authentication\" option when configuring Azure AD Connect for your hybrid deployment."

No\n\nAssigning the Application Administrator role to User1 does not meet the goal of allowing User1 to review Conditional Access policies.\n\nThe Application Administrator role in Microsoft 365 primarily focuses on managing applications and their associated settings, such as configuring and managing Azure AD app registrations, managing application permissions, and handling application integrations. This role does not include specific permissions for reviewing or managing Conditional Access policies.\n\nTo allow User1 to review Conditional Access policies, you would need to assign them a role that specifically includes the necessary permissions for managing Conditional Access. The appropriate role for this requirement is the Conditional Access Administrator role. This role grants users the ability to create, view, and manage Conditional Access policies within the Microsoft 365 environment.\n\nTherefore, assigning the Application Administrator role to User1 does not meet the goal of allowing them to review Conditional Access policies."
