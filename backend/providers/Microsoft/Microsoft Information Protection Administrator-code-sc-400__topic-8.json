The email message is permanently deleted at the end of the five years because of the delete action that was suspended while the retention action was in effect.\n\n\n\nHence, the answer is Yes, Yes, No."

Retain forever means take steps to ensure the item is never permanently deleted (will always be returned in eDiscovery searches). Whereas \"do nothing\" at the end of the retention period means no longer take steps to ensure the item isn't permanently deleted - in other words, the item can now be deleted by a user or system-initiated action &amp; they won't be returned by eDiscovery searches. So, there is no way to recover the file after 4 years, for 2026 the file will be deleted."
