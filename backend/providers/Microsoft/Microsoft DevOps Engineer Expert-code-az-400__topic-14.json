This allows you to restrict access to Azure DevOps from certain locations, ensuring that only authorized users can access the resources. Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) are also important security measures, but they do not directly address the requirement of restricting access based on IP addresses. On-premises firewall rules are not applicable in this scenario as Azure DevOps is a cloud-based service."
