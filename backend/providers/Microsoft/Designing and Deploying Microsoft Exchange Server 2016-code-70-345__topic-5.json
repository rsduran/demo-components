In other words, there is preference to have the users operate out of one datacenter during normal operations and only have the users operate out of the second datacenter during failure events. There is also a possibility that users do not have equal connectivity to both datacenters. Typically, in a bound model, there are two DAGs deployed in the datacenter pair. Each DAG contains a set of mailbox databases for a particular datacenter; by controlling where the databases are mounted, you control connectivity.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>Deploy a unified namespace for the site resilient datacenter pair (unbound model).<br>In an unbound model, you have a single DAG deployed across the datacenter pair.",
