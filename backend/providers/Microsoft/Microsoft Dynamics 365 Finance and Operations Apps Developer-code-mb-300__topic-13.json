I'll vote for Segregation of duties conflicts instead. Segregation of duties conflicts refer to situations where an individual has access to two or more functions that should be separated to prevent fraud or errors. In Dynamics 365 Finance, you can identify and resolve conflicts in segregation of duties by going to System administration &gt; Security &gt; Segregation of duties &gt; Segregation of duties unresolved conflicts. You can then select a conflict and choose an action such as denying assignment of the user to the additional security role."
