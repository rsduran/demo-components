User passwords are not stored in the cloud, ensuring that they remain on-premises.\n\nSeamless SSO further simplifies the user experience by allowing users to access Microsoft 365 services without having to enter their credentials again. This is accomplished through the use of Kerberos authentication, which enables the user's on-premises credentials to be used for authentication to Microsoft 365 services.\n\nBoth pass-through authentication and seamless SSO can be implemented using the current server infrastructure, without the need for additional hardware or software.

It also eliminates the need for users to remember multiple sets of credentials for on-premises and cloud-based services.\n\nTherefore, PTA with seamless SSO is better than just PTA because it provides a better user experience, while maintaining security and reducing the risk of credential phishing attacks."

Yes you can use 'Where-Object' to pipe through but when you are working with large sets of users it is better to have your filters in the first command to be most efficient.\nBack to the OP though - main reason it needs updating is that the MFA and registration info is now available directly via a downloadable report in the portal and there is a new Authentication Methods experience that is is actually using different properties now only exposable via Graph API. You can use MGGraph powershell module and the Get-MgUserAuthenticationPhoneMethod to get the info via powershell also, or just graph API rest calls"
