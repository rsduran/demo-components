Five percent of the existing data is modified each day.<br>The Finance department loads large CSV files into a number of tables each business day at 11:15 hours and 15:15 hours by using the BCP or BULK INSERT commands. Each data load adds 3 GB of data to the database.<br>These data load operations must occur in the minimum amount of time.<br>A full database backup is performed every Sunday at 10:00 hours. Backup operations will be performed every two hours (11:00, 13:00, 15:00, and 17:00) during business hours.<br>You need to ensure that the minimum amount of data is lost.<br>Which recovery model should the database use?<br>",
