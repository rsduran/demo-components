        "content": "To enable TDE with your own key you must do it at the Azure SQL SERVER level. At the Azure SQL DATABASE you can only turn it on / off. Since one of the requirement is that you must use your own key, the correct answer is the following:\n1 - Create key vault\n2 - Create a key\n3 - From the setting of the Azure SQL server, configure TDE (by selecting the newly created key)\n\nHowever, it is also possible to create a key (or even the Azure key vault!) directy while enabling TDE from Azure SQL Server. So I guess you could shuffle the above steps and say that 1 - 3 - 2 is the correct answer... or even 3 - 1 - 2... personally I think that 1 - 2 - 3 just makes more sense."
