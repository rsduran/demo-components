For autocompletion, the focus is on the autocomplete endpoint, not the search endpoint.\n\nD. - Typically, you would add a single suggester that includes multiple fields as source fields rather than creating a separate suggester for each field. Therefore, this action is not as efficient or necessary if you can accomplish your goal with one suggester that encompasses all relevant fields.\n\nE. Set the searchAnalyzer property for the three product name variants. - Setting the searchAnalyzer property is relevant for controlling how text is analyzed during search queries.  it's not directly involved in setting up autocompletion."
