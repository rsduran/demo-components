It actually didnt work in Chrome for SGT because here.. they are using ms prefix.. which is experimental css for internet explorer.. Im not even sure if it actually works in IE lol i didnt wanna check.\nLets say we do have content in both divs... well, the .text div will fill all the cells in the grid, \nSo... my guess is No, Yes, Yes  , Im mmm just not 100% sure about the second one, its kind of tricky, because bluebox will  always be displayed in row 2 column 2.. but you wont see it coz the .text div is over that cell..."

    "answerDescription": "* From Scenario: Do not allow other DOM elements to receive the event.<br><br>So: bubbles: false -<br>* From scenario: Allow the event to be cancelled.<br><br>So: cancellable: true -<br>* From scenario:<br>The webpage must contain an HTML element named ordersListing that will receive the custom event notification.<br>* Events which are designated as bubbling will initially proceed with the same event flow as non-bubbling events. The event is dispatched to its target EventTarget and any event listeners found there are triggered. Bubbling events will then trigger any additional event listeners found by following the EventTarget's parent chain upward, checking for any event listeners registered on each successive EventTarget. This upward propagation will continue up to and including the Document.<br>EventListeners registered as capturers will not be triggered during this phase. The chain of EventTargets from the event target to the top of the tree is determined before the initial dispatch of the event. If modifications occur to the tree during event processing, event flow will proceed based on the initial state of the tree.<br>Note:<br>* Ajax (an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a group of interrelated web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Data can be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used instead), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.",
