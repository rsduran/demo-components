To avoid this latency, you can switch to an App Service plan with Always On enabled. You can also use an Event Grid trigger with your Blob storage account.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan#always-on \n\nhttps://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/wiki/Enable-Always-On-when-running-on-dedicated-App-Service-Plan\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview \n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger?tabs=csharp#event-grid-trigger"
