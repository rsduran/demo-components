Users with maintain rights will be able to create, update, and delete the exclusion list. Permissions must be assigned to security roles to match company security model.<br>The privileges are simply a way to grant permissions to an entry point, which can be services, to a duty, role, or even directly to a user. Typically, we only add entry points to a privilege, such as menu items.<br>D: You can extend a Security Role or a Security Duty to add new duties/privileges to these elements.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>C: We can't extend security privileges, we would always create a new privilege.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/extending-microsoft-dynamics/9781786467133/40a348f3-0f4c-4d47-a566-59f3a2e6afa0.xhtml https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/extensibility/customization-overlayering-extensions#security-role-and-duty-extensions",
