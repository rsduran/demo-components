For more information, learn more about frontline worker setup.\nAccount or Contact: Choose this option if the resource isn\u2019t directly a part of your organization, but needs to be scheduled.

So with A it is possible that an incident type has tasks, services, products, but a related work order generated from agreement has not.

For example, normally the incident would require 1 hour of a service, but for the agreement, you negotiated with the customer 2 hours of a service. Rather than having to create a second incident type just for this agreement, you can set Copy Incident Items to Agreement to No, add the incident to the agreement, then manually add the specific service tasks, product, services, and so on. This way you can use the same incident type, which helps for reporting later on. Set this option to Yes and the incident items will be added to the agreement and you can accept these items or make slight variations from there.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/field-service/set-up-customer-agreements"

The question is referring to a Project Template, this is a term used in the Power Platform Data Integration. Typically you would set the work order to generate an invoice in Field Service when the status is Closed - Posted , then using a Data Integration project, you would integrate the invoice.\n\nThe part that is confusing me is that the question states that the template keeps failing, the only possible reasons for this is connection, mismatching data types, incorrect dimensions or field mapping. \n\nThe question says the Project Template is \"Failing\" therefore a connection must have been established, if failing means the records did not transfer, then B woulk most likely be reason assuming you have configured the filter criteria in Power Query accordingly.

No. Time groups are more to block than to make a schedule.\n\nWhile time groups can be useful for organizing schedules into broader categories (like morning and afternoon sessions), they don't inherently create the precise 30-minute slots required in this scenario. Time groups would be more appropriate if the requirement was to divide the day into larger blocks of time, rather than consistent short intervals.\nIn this case, using intervals set to 30 minutes will create a daily schedule for pediatricians that meets both stated requirements: 30-minute frequency for each slot and a full-day schedule with clear start and end times for each appointment. but the stress is more on the duration than the exact start time (every full hour)."

All of the data rolls-up to Contoso Global HQ for executive management reporting. Sales Reps who work with global accounts struggle to obtain the data they need to support their clients.<br><br>The current data access structure appears as follows:<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-240/image111.png\"><br><br>Existing environment. Field Service structure<br><br>Contoso's field service technicians respond to all installation work orders with two human resources:<br>\u2022 One licensed technician (Level 3), and...<br>\u2022 One apprentice technician. Apprentices can be either Level 1 (new trainee) or Level 2 (halfway through training).<br><br>In many cases installation work also requires the use of specialty tools, depending on what is being installed. The current system does not have any way to track the level of skill for each resource, nor the uses for the specialty tools.

General overview<br><br>Contoso Ltd. is a leading provider of technology services, with clients all around the world.<br><br>Contoso Ltd. has over 1,000 offices globally and over 10,000 employees servicing those buildings, from janitorial service people, repair technicians and new project (office setup, painting, furniture) setup resources. Each day, they dispatch these resources to work on and/or repair items in the cluster of buildings within their geographical area.<br><br>The major offices are located in North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-240/image128.png\"><br><br><br>Company background. Concerns -<br><br>Contoso Ltd. has several key challenges and issues in managing their day-to-day operations and facilities.<br><br>Many of their facilities have issues spanning five-to-ten days, before the proper personnel begins to work on the request. In some cases, issues within their facilities cause significant issues for the employees in the building or cause disruptions to customers. For example: An air conditioning issue causes servers to reach a critical temperature. It forces servers to shut down, and Contoso Ltd. must employ their emergency disruption plans.<br><br>Additional concerns:<br>1. Many different and siloed systems to manage requests, and track history and progress.<br>2. No concise and definitive processes to log, manage and complete requests throughout the organization.<br>3. No tools and technology to make technicians more effective.<br>4. Lack of ease for internal customers to log a request for work, provide updates and track progress.<br>5. The inability to monitor equipment performance and check for anomalies, and then interpret and act upon the data.<br>6. Lack of insight of historical details for the technicians and building management.<br>7. Field technicians experience issues trying to work in areas that do not have internet connectivity. Most of the requests are details within an email. As a result, they always carry paper copies of all the requests.<br>8. The current system lacks the ability to capture real-time data for system critical components, such as air conditioning and heating units, and energy consumption details.<br>9. Technicians in the field do not have standard devices. Some have iPhones and Android devices, while some use Windows-based laptops, such as the Surface Pro 7.<br><br>Field Service background and pain points<br><br>Field Service background and pain points. Scheduling and work orders challenges<br><br>During several discovery sessions, key users (subject matter experts) mentioned the following areas of operation pain points.<br><br><br>Scheduling and work orders -<br>\u2022 Outlook and Excel is used to schedule technicians.<br>\u2022 Technicians receive email appointments with the applicable details, and self-schedule work based on their availability.<br>\u2022 Technicians and contractors work primarily in email, and print out the work order details from the email. This has turned into a large amount of paper work orders with cryptic email notes.<br>\u2022 There is zero reporting or insight, and in-house technicians cannot monitor critical equipment to ensure it is working as expected.<br>\u2022 Since the equipment is not monitored, often the breakdown of equipment is what leads to recognition of a potential issue and the scheduling of a work request.<br><br>The implementation team recognized, during the initial implementation, that technicians need access to several custom entities. Without that visibility, the technicians will not be able to complete their work.<br><br>Field Service background and pain points. Visibility challenges<br><br>Technicians and dispatchers have either limited or zero visibility to:<br>\u2022 Install-base history.<br>\u2022 Real-time readings of equipment.<br>\u2022 Customer Information including detailed request information.<br>\u2022 Customer updates.<br>\u2022 Correct equipment they should be working on. Cannot search or see serial number or barcode of equipment.<br><br>There is also no ability to work offline with the data.<br><br>Field Service background and pain points. Challenges associated with the team<br><br>IT staff:<br>\u2022 Are inexperienced when it comes to implementing and managing software implementations, and the ongoing maintenance. They quickly find themselves experiencing issues implementing changes required by the users.<br>\u2022 Struggle with the concept of connected field service. They do not understand the different options, benefits, or the security model.<br>\u2022 Need a solution that can store device data for longer time periods to perform data analysis to better predict device failures.<br><br>Technicians:<br>\u2022 Have issues gaining access to the mobile app and receive error messages when trying to connect.<br>\u2022 Cannot access the data offline.<br><br>Managers:<br>\u2022 Need mobile access.<br>\u2022 Need access to historical data.<br>\u2022 Need access to a broader and larger amount of data than the technicians.<br><br>Field Service background and pain points. Asset management data challenges<br><br>As a large global company, Contoso Ltd.'s lack of consolidated systems, and systems that track and maintain asset history, has become a significant issue for technicians.<br><br>In addition, technicians are constantly being forced to leave in-progress low priority jobs to handle emergency issues. If Contoso Ltd. had the ability to determine when a system would experience a failure, and alert them ahead of time, many of the emergency issues could have been avoided. This capability needs to be in the new system.<br><br>Desired solution and requirements<br><br>Desired solution and requirements. Overall Field Service requirements<br><br>During requirement gathering workshops, the following high-level Field Service requirements were captured:<br>\u2022 Standardize systems onto a single platform.<br>\u2022 Provide an effective tool for employees and third-party contractors to digitally manage work.<br>\u2022 Streamline the service request process; automating processes where possible.<br>\u2022 Implement Dynamics 365 Field Service Mobile app, along with Connected Field Service capabilities.<br>\u25e6 Connected Field Service solution needs to allow for development capabilities, such as sending remote commands.<br>\u2022 Implement scheduling to ensure successful adoption.<br>\u2022 Provide insight and analytics to key personnel.<br>\u2022 Receive automated prescriptive guidance.<br><br>Further, there is a need to secure data and access for technicians and management to see only the data they need to see.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-240/image129.png\"><br><br>Desired solution and requirements. Install-base requirements<br><br>1. Access to all service history and historical readings.<br>2. Access to warranty and service contract details.<br>3. Proactive monitoring of the install base health, including alerts to the internal call center team.<br>4. Details of the customer asset, including BOM (bill of material) and various key properties that are maintained over time.<br><br>Desired solution and requirements. Connected Field Service requirements<br><br>1. Configure and setup Connected Field Service.<br>2. Implement a solution that will capture large amounts of data to accurately predict failures.<br>3.
