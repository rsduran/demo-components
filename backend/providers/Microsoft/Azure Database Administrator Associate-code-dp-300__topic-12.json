Failover groups also provide automatic failover without requiring manual intervention, ensuring high availability and compliance with the 99.99% SLA for Azure SQL Database."

They want the DB to be available in case there is a regional event.. it's a PaaS not IaaS so it can't be Always On Availability Group.  Geo-replication would mean new connection strings so access would not be restored quickly.  So it must be failover group."
