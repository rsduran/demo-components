If you have a security group that already contains all the desired computer objects, this solution is the faster. however you cannot assume that. so you would need to create a group and put all the servers as members of the group. you can acheive that using powershell pretty quickly. in my opinion the \"Operating System\" option is the way to go since it allows to filter by role: \"Any\", \"Member Server\" and \"Domain Controller\", so you would need to add a few rows (7 from 2003 to 2022) such as OS is server 2003 family, OS is server 2003R2 family, OS is server 2008 family .... and for each one of these you would chose the role \"Member Server\"."

It causes the client to try to find a domain controller in the next closest site, rather than trying to authenticate with a domain controller in a remote site.\n\nTo achieve the goal of ensuring that the client computers in the new office are primarily authenticated by the domain controllers in Site1, you would need to configure the site link and site link costs between Site1 and the new office site so that the new office site has a higher cost to communicate with other sites than Site1. This way, the clients will prefer to authenticate with the domain controllers in Site1."

The PDC Emulator is considered the primary domain controller for processing GPO updates and other important tasks. Therefore, making changes or updates on the domain controller with the PDC Emulator role could be seen as a best practice. But... in our case, we should maintain a separate PolicyDefinitions folder in the SYSVOL directory for each domain controller if they are in different domains within the forest. This approach ensures that each domain can manage its GPOs independently while allowing for the possibility of having domain-specific administrative templates. So rather (2, 4), what do you think?"
