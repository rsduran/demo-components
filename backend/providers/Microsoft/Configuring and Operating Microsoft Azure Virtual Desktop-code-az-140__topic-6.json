From Azure Cloud Shell, run the Get-AzVm cmdlet.\n\nWhile this cmdlet can provide information about VMs, it doesn't directly show licensing information. It would require additional parsing and might not give as clear information as the Azure portal.\n\nThe Azure portal provides a straightforward, visual way to check the licensing status of a specific VM, making it the most efficient and reliable method for this task."
