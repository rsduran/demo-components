The important thing is that Standard-SKU Public IP configuration only allows for static IPs (dynamic IPs are not possible with Standard-SKU).\nIn result only VMs with no public IP or Standard-SKU/static IP can be added to the backend pool. So these two answers seem possible: \"Remove the public IP address from VM1\" and \"Change the private IP address of VM1 to static\". But if we need to select only 1 correct answer I would go with \"Change the private IP address of VM1 to static\" (which effextively means removing the current Basic-SKU Public IP address configuration from VM's NIC and adding a Standard-SKU Public IP address configuration which will be static). Because changing the VM's IP to static is possible then removing the public IP from the VM is not a must."

To prevent RDP access to the virtual machines from the Internet you can remove the public IP addresses from the virtual machines. This is a best practice as well.
