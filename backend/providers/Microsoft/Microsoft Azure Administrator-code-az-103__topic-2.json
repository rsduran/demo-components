If it stated in the question, not the answer, that the start of a work week is Sunday, then 14 days makes sense because 9 days prior to Monday is a Saturday- aka the end of a week. But the statement wants the beginning of that work week, meaning we migrate back to the Sunday that started that work week. It's just annoying because it doesnt say in the question that Sunday is considered Day 1 of a Workweek."

This means that when you mount a file share over SMB or access it via the FileREST protocol (such as through the Azure portal, PowerShell/CLI, or Azure SDKs), Azure Files will only allow the connection if it is made with SMB 3.0+ with encryption or HTTPS. Clients that do not support SMB 3.0 or clients that support SMB 3.0 but not SMB encryption will not be able to mount the Azure file share if encryption in transit is enabled. For more information about which operating systems support SMB 3.0 with encryption, see our detailed documentation for Windows, macOS, and Linux. All current versions of the PowerShell, CLI, and SDKs support HTTPS.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-networking-overview\n\nSo, the answer given is correct."

For example, you can generate a token with read-only access to a specific file that has a 10-minute expiry. Anyone who possesses the token while the token is valid has read-only access to that file for those 10 minutes. Shared access signature keys are supported only via the REST API or in client libraries.

Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region:\n\nLocally redundant storage (LRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. LRS is the least expensive replication option, but is not recommended for applications requiring high availability.\nZone-redundant storage (ZRS) copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region."
