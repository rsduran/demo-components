The NPS role is installed on a domain-joined server or the domain controller and is configured to authenticate and authorize RADIUS requests from the VPN client.\n\nThe VPN should be configured to use RADIUS authentication and point to the NPS server.\n\nThe MFA NPS extension is installed anywhere but the VPN server. When a user/VPN client attempts to authenticate, it sends a RADIUS request to the NPS server through the VPN which performs the primary authentication and then triggers the NPS Extension for secondary authentication."

The account locks again after each subsequent failed sign-in attempt, for one minute at first and longer in subsequent attempts. To minimize the ways an attacker could work around this behavior, we don't disclose the rate at which the lockout period grows over additional unsuccessful sign-in attempts.\n\nSmart lockout tracks the last three bad password hashes to avoid incrementing the lockout counter for the same password. If someone enters the same bad password multiple times, this behavior won't cause the account to lock out.\n\nbased on the above and the hashes, 5 would be correct answer for \"tracked sign-in attempts\"."

ADatum Environment<br><br>The on-premises network of ADatum contains an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forest named adatum.com.<br><br>ADatum has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription. The subscription contains a verified domain that syncs with the adatum.com AD DS domain by using Azure AD Connect.<br><br>ADatum has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named adatum.com. The tenant has Security defaults disabled.<br><br>The tenant contains the users shown in the following table.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/sc-300/image246.png\"><br><br>The tenant contains the groups shown in the following table.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/sc-300/image247.png\"><br><br>Existing Environment. Litware Environment<br><br>Litware has an AD DS forest named litware.com<br><br>Existing Environment. Problem Statements<br><br>ADatum identifies the following issues:<br><br>\u2022\tMultiple users in the sales department have up to five devices. The sales department users report that sometimes they must contact the support department to join their devices to the Azure AD tenant because they have reached their device limit.<br>\u2022\tA recent security incident reveals that several users leaked their credentials, a suspicious browser was used for a sign-in, and resources were accessed from an anonymous IP address.<br>\u2022\tWhen you attempt to assign the Device Administrators role to IT_Group1, the group does NOT appear in the selection list.<br>\u2022\tAnyone in the organization can invite guest users, including other guests and non-administrators.<br>\u2022\tThe helpdesk spends too much time resetting user passwords.<br>\u2022\tUsers currently use only passwords for authentication.<br><br><br>Requirements. Planned Changes<br> -<br><br>ADatum plans to implement the following changes:<br><br>\u2022\tConfigure self-service password reset (SSPR).<br>\u2022\tConfigure multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.<br>\u2022\tConfigure an access review for an access package named Package1.<br>\u2022\tRequire admin approval for application access to organizational data.<br>\u2022\tSync the AD DS users and groups of litware.com with the Azure AD tenant.<br>\u2022\tEnsure that only users that are assigned specific admin roles can invite guest users.<br>\u2022\tIncrease the maximum number of devices that can be joined or registered to Azure AD to 10.<br><br>Requirements. Technical Requirements<br><br>ADatum identifies the following technical requirements:<br><br>\u2022\tUsers assigned the User administrator role must be able to request permission to use the role when needed for up to one year.<br>\u2022\tUsers must be prompted to register for MFA and provided with an option to bypass the registration for a grace period.<br>\u2022\tUsers must provide one authentication method to reset their password by using SSPR. Available methods must include:<br>- Email<br>- Phone<br>- Security questions<br>- The Microsoft Authenticator app<br>\u2022\tTrust relationships must NOT be established between the adatum.com and litware.com AD DS domains.<br>\u2022\tThe principle of least privilege must be used.<br><br><br>You implement the planned changes for SSPR.<br><br>What occurs when User3 attempts to use SSPR?
