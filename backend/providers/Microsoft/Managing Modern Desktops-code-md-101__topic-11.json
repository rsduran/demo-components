Hiding overrides stops the action immediately. Allowing overrides lets the employee know there's a risk, but lets him or her continue to share the data while recording and auditing the action. \"\n\nTherefore, since the question is asking to prevent the sharing of proprietary code. We're not restricting who has ACCESS to that data, but restricting how someone with access can SHARE that data.\n\nFinal answer. B - Windows Information Protection (WIP)"
