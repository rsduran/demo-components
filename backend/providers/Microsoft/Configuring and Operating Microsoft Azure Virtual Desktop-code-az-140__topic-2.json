No. Configuring the Address space settings of the virtual network that contains the session hosts does not prevent users from accessing the internet from Azure Virtual Desktop sessions. The Address space settings define the range of IP addresses that can be used by the virtual network and its subnets1. They do not control the outbound traffic from the session hosts to the internet.\n\nTo prevent users from accessing the internet from Azure Virtual Desktop sessions, you need to configure a network security group (NSG) or a firewall that blocks outbound internet access for the session hosts, while allowing access to the required Microsoft services23. You can also use Azure Firewall or Azure Firewall Manager to centrally manage and enforce network security policies for your Azure Virtual Desktop environment45."

Each image version can be replicated to different regions depending on what makes sense for your organization. One example is to always replicate the latest image in multi-regions while all older image versions are only available in 1 region. This can help save on storage costs.\n\nThe regions that a resource is replicated to can be updated after creation time. The time it takes to replicate to different regions depends on the amount of data being copied and the number of regions the version is replicated to. This can take a few hours in some cases. While the replication is happening, you can view the status of replication per region. Once the image replication is complete in a region, you can then deploy a VM or scale-set using that resource in the region.\n\nAnd oc the images needs to be generalized."
