Since we are deploying the template across several VMs and need to authenticate with the extension repository ( for downloading extensions), we need to provide the VM an identity to authenticate with the repository. This is best done by assigning the VM with a  \"user assigned managed identity\". We can set up this managed identity to have the required permissions on the extension repository via RBAC roles.

Thus, you need to specify the workspace ID in the ARM template to tell the scanner where to send the data.\n\nE.

Please find below:\nHere as a first step, we need to know Azure BluePrintLOCK does not affect existing resource before the assignment of it. In this configuration we assign it to the RG2 and RG1 already exists and nothing will not affect RG1.\nBox-1 No, rg1 already exists.\nBox-2 rg2 is created with blueprint that and it is in read only, however we need to bear in our mind that adding tags can be happen even if we have read only blueprint, blueprint does not affect tags but affects all other properties. So, we can only change the tags, but other properties will be same.\nBox-3 We cannot remove the role of User1 as RG2 is in the read only.\nAll in all, answer will be here NO, Yes, NO"

In this case, you want to monitor resources within Sub1. So, you should assign Policy1 to Sub1. This will enforce the policy on resources within Sub1 and report compliance status to Azure Security Center.\n\nOption A (\"Change the Category of Policy1 to Security Center\") is not the correct action to take.

Initiatives are used to group multiple policies together for assignment but won't change the scope of enforcement.\n\nOption C (\"Change the Definition location of Policy1 to Sub1\") is not needed.

I answered this question for me as following:\nIn this question there is some key point that we need to know and maybe we will see in the exam or real-life cases. Here are the notes for these questions.\n1.We can assign Roles to the Microsoft 365 groups as well as Security Groups.\n2.Mail enabled security groups are the groups which can be used for access management purposes (as security group) and for group communication (which allows groups for communication as Microsoft 365 group). We can assign roles to mail enabled security groups as well. Here we should keep in mind that Role assignable groups does not support group nesting (there is some questions in the bank -writing this for remembering as a note)."

This approach ensures that only VM1, which has a private endpoint, can access the resources in Vault1. This is a more secure method than simply allowing an IP address or a virtual network because it leverages Azure Private Link to establish a secure connection.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not provide the same level of security and access control as using a private endpoint. Option A allows access based on an IP address, which can be less secure. Option C adds the entire virtual network, potentially allowing more resources than just VM1 to access Vault1. Option D allows trusted Microsoft services to bypass the firewall, but it doesn't restrict access to VM1 specifically.\""
