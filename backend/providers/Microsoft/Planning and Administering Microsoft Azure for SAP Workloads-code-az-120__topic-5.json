The secure data transfer is accelerated by shipping you a proprietary Data Box storage device. Each storage device has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 TB and is transported to your datacenter through a regional carrier. The device has a rugged casing to protect and secure data during the transit.<br>File server: Azure Storage Explorer<br>Azure Storage Explorer is an application which helps you to easily access the Azure storage account through any device on any platform, be it Windows, MacOS, or Linux. You can easily connect to your subscription and manipulate your tables, blobs, queues, and files.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databox/data-box-overview https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md",
