By doing so, the workload can be distributed over multiple disks, resulting in better I/O performance.\n\n2.Accelerated Networking is a feature in Azure that can help to reduce network latency between virtual machines. By enabling Accelerated Networking, you can offload some of the networking processing to the NIC hardware, which can result in reduced CPU usage and lower network latency.\n\n3.The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size determines the maximum size of a packet that can be transmitted over a network. If the MTU sizes are not the same between the SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) and the SAP application servers, this can result in packet fragmentation and retransmission, which can increase CPU utilization and network latency. Setting the MTU on the primary network interface to match the MTU on SAP application servers can help to reduce these issues."
