Enable MFA for the Research group members.\n\nEnabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the Research group members adds an extra layer of security to their mailbox accounts and helps protect against unauthorized access, including potential spear-phishing attacks. By enabling MFA, users are required to provide additional verification, such as a code sent to their mobile device or biometric authentication, when signing in to their accounts.\n\nBefore running the Attack simulator, it's important to ensure that the target users, in this case, the members of the Research group, have MFA enabled.

This can include sharing info across non-enterprise-protected apps in addition to sharing enterprise data between other people and devices outside of your enterprise.\n\nI don't think that WIP is going to allow the ability to copy the data from App1 to App3. Also App3 isn't included in the policy anywhere. Every time I've read something about WIP if an app isn't a part of the policy, it's unenlightened and you can't do anything with it. \n\nSo I say it's N/Y/N."

So since App1 is protected with the block, meaning \"...This can include sharing info across non-enterprise-protected apps in addition to sharing enterprise data between other people and devices outside of your enterprise.\" So Android can't even get to App1 to copy anything in the first place.\n\nQ2: N - True, Device2 is a Windows 10 box, but App2 is excluded from the policy so it can't copy to App2 either.\n\nQ3: N - Same as Q2, only you have App3. App3 isn't protected so it can't have App1 data copied to it.\n\nSo my answer has changed slightly to N,N,N."

Adding data connectors will not help you to detect multistage attacks.

At first I was thinking \"if there isn't a TPM and we don't know what the BIOS or UEFI firmware is, how do we know?\" Well, I think it has to do with the fact that BTG doesn't require a TPM or a certain BIOS/UEFI version. You are encrypting REMOVABLE disks. That's why all of the devices can use BTG.\n\nAuto Unlock requires a Bitlocker'ed system disk. Those we know have compatible TPM/BIOS/UEFI. The D: drive in this question is NOT removeable. It is a secondary disk. So, the systems that have an encrypted system drive, can use Auto-Unlock.\n\nGiven all my research and asking \"WTF!?\", I think the given answers are correct."

It does not affect the detection of sensitive groups or malicious services.\nOption C, Turn on Delayed updates for the Microsoft Defender for Identity sensors, is incorrect because this setting is used to delay the synchronization of the Microsoft Defender for Identity database. It does not affect the detection of sensitive groups or malicious services.\nOption D, Enable the Audit account management Group Policy setting for the servers, is incorrect because this setting is used to audit account management events on the servers. It does not affect the detection of sensitive groups or malicious services.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
