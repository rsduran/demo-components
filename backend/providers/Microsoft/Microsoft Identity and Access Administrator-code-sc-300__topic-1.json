These can include security groups, Microsoft 365 groups, and either assigned or dynamic groups. You can even create a dynamic device security group and assign E5 licences to it, which doesn't make sense but is true (I've tested it).\n\nHowever, the missing bit of information is whether the Microsoft 365 groups have the \"SecurityEnabled\" attribute set to True. Only M365 groups that have the \"SecurityEnabled\" attribute set to True can have licences assigned to them. If the group is created in the M365 Admin Centre, then the \"SecurityEnabled\" attribute is set to False and you can not assign licences to the group. But if the M365 group is created in the Azure AD portal, then the \"SecurityEnabled\" attribute is set to True and you can assign licences.\n\nFor the answer, I would make an assumption that because this is an Identity-related exam testing us on Azure AD topics, that the M365 groups were created in the Azure AD portal and therefore have the \"SecurityEnabled\" attribute set to True. Which means the correct answer is B - all groups."

Password writeback removes the need to set up an on-premises solution for users to reset their password.

You can find more information on how to configure PTA in the Microsoft documentation 1.\n\nAlternatively, you can configure Azure AD provisioning to deprovision or deactivate disabled users in applications. For applications that don\u2019t use Azure AD SaaS App Provisioning, you can use Identity Manager (MIM) or a 3rd party solution to automate the deprovisioning of users. You should also identify and develop a process for applications that require manual deprovisioning"

Fabrikam has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named fabrikam.com.<br><br>Existing Environment. Existing Environment<br><br>The on-premises network of Contoso contains an Active Directory domain named contoso.com. The domain contains an organizational unit (OU) named Contoso_Resources. The Contoso_Resources OU contains all users and computers.<br><br>The contoso.com Active Directory domain contains the relevant users shown in the following table.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/sc-300/image243.png\"><br><br>Contoso also includes a marketing department that has users in each office.<br><br>Existing Environment. Microsoft 365/Azure Environment<br><br>Contoso has an Azure AD tenant named contoso.com that has the following associated licenses:<br><br>\u2022\tMicrosoft Office 365 Enterprise E5<br>\u2022\tEnterprise Mobility + Security E5<br>\u2022\tWindows 10 Enterprise E3<br>\u2022\tProject Plan 3<br><br>Azure AD Connect is configured between Azure AD and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Only the Contoso_Resources OU is synced.<br><br>Helpdesk administrators routinely use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage user settings.<br><br>User administrators currently use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manually assign licenses. All users have all licenses assigned besides the following exceptions:<br><br>\u2022\tThe users in the London office have the Microsoft 365 Phone System license unassigned.<br>\u2022\tThe users in the Seattle office have the Yammer Enterprise license unassigned.<br><br>Security defaults are disabled for contoso.com.<br><br>Contoso uses Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to protect administrative roles.<br><br>Existing Environment. Problem Statements<br><br>Contoso identifies the following issues:<br><br>\u2022\tCurrently, all the helpdesk administrators can manage user licenses throughout the entire Microsoft 365 tenant.<br>\u2022\tThe user administrators report that it is tedious to manually configure the different license requirements for each Contoso office.<br>\u2022\tThe helpdesk administrators spend too much time provisioning internal and guest access to the required Microsoft 365 services and apps.<br>\u2022\tCurrently, the helpdesk administrators can perform tasks by using the User administrator role without justification or approval.<br>\u2022\tWhen the Logs node is selected in Azure AD, an error message appears stating that Log Analytics integration is not enabled.<br><br><br>Requirements. Planned Changes<br> -<br><br>Contoso plans to implement the following changes:<br><br>\u2022\tImplement self-service password reset (SSPR).<br>\u2022\tAnalyze Azure audit activity logs by using Azure Monitor.<br>\u2022\tSimplify license allocation for new users added to the tenant.<br>\u2022\tCollaborate with the users at Fabrikam on a joint marketing campaign.<br>\u2022\tConfigure the User administrator role to require justification and approval to activate.<br>\u2022\tImplement a custom line-of-business Azure web app named App1. App1 will be accessible from the internet and authenticated by using Azure AD accounts.<br>\u2022\tFor new users in the marketing department, implement an automated approval workflow to provide access to a Microsoft SharePoint Online site, group, and app.<br><br>Contoso plans to acquire a company named ADatum Corporation. One hundred new ADatum users will be created in an Active Directory OU named Adatum. The users will be located in London and Seattle.<br><br>Requirements. Technical Requirements<br><br>Contoso identifies the following technical requirements:<br><br>\u2022\tAll users must be synced from AD DS to the contoso.com Azure AD tenant.<br>\u2022\tApp1 must have a redirect URI pointed to https://contoso.com/auth-response.<br>\u2022\tLicense allocation for new users must be assigned automatically based on the location of the user.<br>\u2022\tFabrikam users must have access to the marketing department\u2019s SharePoint site for a maximum of 90 days.<br>\u2022\tAdministrative actions performed in Azure AD must be audited. Audit logs must be retained for one year.<br>\u2022\tThe helpdesk administrators must be able to manage licenses for only the users in their respective office.<br>\u2022\tUsers must be forced to change their password if there is a probability that the users\u2019 identity was compromised.<br><br><br>You need to meet the technical requirements for license management by the help desk administrators.<br><br>What should you create first, and which tool should you use?
