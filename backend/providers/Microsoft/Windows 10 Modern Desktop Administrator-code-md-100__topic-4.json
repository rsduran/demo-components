You do that by adding him to the Remote Desktop Users group (D). You MUST NOT \"modify the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services user right\" since it contains already administrators and the Remote Desktop User group.\nYou also do not have to create a new user (typo in the answer D) because the user is already created in AzureAD (first sentence). So you only have to add it to the group. Something like : net localgroup \"Remote Desktop Users\" /add \"AzureAD\\user1@contoso.com\".\nIt worked for me in a test lab.

In practical terms you can open a lot of ports by creating many rules and it will work fine.\n\nThe other, less invasive scenario, with the possibility of maintaining the organization of the logs and even saving copies of the machine's logs. I'm talking about Windows Event Subscription. The stream of events from a source to a collector is called a&nbsp;subscription.\n\nBased on the statement, it is understood that it is necessary to maintain a level of security, the Firewall must be activated.
