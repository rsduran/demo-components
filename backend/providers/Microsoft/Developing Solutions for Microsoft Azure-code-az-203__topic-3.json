All system properties must be prefixed with sys. in the conditional expression.

A common use is to match against the CorrelationId property, but the application can also choose to match against ContentType, Label, MessageId, ReplyTo,<br>ReplyToSessionId, SessionId, To, and any user-defined properties. A match exists when an arriving message's value for a property is equal to the value specified in the correlation filter. For string expressions, the comparison is case-sensitive. When specifying multiple match properties, the filter combines them as a logical<br>AND condition, meaning for the filter to match, all conditions must match.<br>Boolean filters - The TrueFilter and FalseFilter either cause all arriving messages (true) or none of the arriving messages (false) to be selected for the subscription.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/topic-filters",
