An index in a database is very similar to an index in the back of a book.\nFor example, if you want to reference all pages in a book that discusses a certain topic, you first refer to the index, which lists all the topics alphabetically and are then referred to one or more specific page numbers.\nAn index helps to speed up SELECT queries and WHERE clauses, but it slows down data input, with the UPDATE and the INSERT statements. Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data.\nCreating an index involves the CREATE INDEX statement, which allows you to name the index, to specify the table and which column or columns to index, and to indicate whether the index is in an ascending or descending order.\nIndexes can also be unique, like the UNIQUE constraint, in that the index prevents duplicate entries in the column or combination of columns on which there is an index.\nThe CREATE INDEX Command\nThe basic syntax of a CREATE INDEX is as follows.\nCREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name;"

Converting this to \"first normal form\" is the first step in database normalization. Each author of the book would appear in a separate row along with the book's primary key. Later normalization stages would move the book-author relationship into a separate table to avoid repeating other book attributes (e.g. title, publisher) for each author."

The ALTER command is a DDL command to modify the structure of existing tables in the database by adding, modifying, renaming, or dropping columns and constraints.

That said, this is really for the sake of learning about DDL/DML etc, and it would be better if they could update that question to ask about removing a column rather than renaming a column. Reason is that those working using SQL Server Management Studio will use the EXEC sp_rename to rename a column as opposed to (I presume) MySQL, Oracle etc. I tried many combinations to rename a column in my Azure Data Studio using ALTER statements (tried ALTER COLUMN, MODIFY, RENAME, CHANGE etc) and nothing worked. Then I executed this sp_rename and it worked no problem - though we also need to be careful about renaming columns as it can affect stored procedures and other things apparently. Anyways, if anyone wants to try, they can find the full EXEC sp_rename statement here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/rename-columns-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver15"

This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.\n\nConstraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.\n\nThe following constraints are commonly used in SQL:\n\nNOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value\nUNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different\nPRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table\nFOREIGN KEY - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table\nCHECK - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition\nDEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified\nINDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly\""
