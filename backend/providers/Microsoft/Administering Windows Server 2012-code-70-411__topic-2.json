It neatly solves the problem of recreating a deleted user or group and having to fix up all the old access control list (ACL) references, which contain the objectSid of the deleted object.<br>Restores domain controllers to a specific point in time, and marks objects in Active Directory as being authoritative with respect to their replication partners.",
