All emails in the group reside in the Conversations space and all the documents go into the Files tab. Also, you can't create subfolders in Microsoft 365 groups.\"\n\nSo they can all be migrated technically, but you'd lose all the hierarchical folders in PF1 that had been assembled. Just so you know!"
