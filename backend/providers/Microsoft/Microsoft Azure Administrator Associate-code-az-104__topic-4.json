Creating an Azure storage account and configuring shared access signatures (SASs) is not necessary for monitoring events on a virtual machine. Azure Monitor can directly collect events from the VM's System event log using the Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n  \n2. The Microsoft Monitoring Agent can indeed collect logs and send them to Azure Monitor, but specifying a storage account as the source would not be the typical approach for monitoring System event logs. You would usually send the logs directly to a Log Analytics workspace.\n\n3. To monitor the System event log for specific events, you would set up a Log Analytics workspace, configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent to send logs to that workspace, and then set up an alert based on a query that examines those logs.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nB.

When deploying resources through Azure Resource Manager templates, it's a best practice to store sensitive data like administrative passwords in Azure Key Vault rather than in the template itself. By referencing the Azure Key Vault in the ARM template, the password can be fetched securely during deployment.\n\nThe access policy in Azure Key Vault defines what operations can be done on the secrets (like read or write) and who can perform these operations.\n\nThus, the best way to securely store and reference an administrative password in an Azure Resource Manager template is by using Azure Key Vault and setting an appropriate access policy."

For example, if you create three or more VMs across three zones in an Azure region, your VMs are effectively distributed across three fault domains and three update domains. The Azure platform recognizes this distribution across update domains to make sure that VMs in different zones are not updated at the same time.\n\nReference link\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-virtual-machine-availability/5-review-availability-zones"

So in a given azure region if you have 3 availability zones, then it's like you have 3 fault domains and 3 update domains.\n\nSo, for example, if you create three VMs across three availability zones in an Azure region, your VMs are effectively distributed across three fault domains and three update domains. \nIf one of the Availability Zones has gone down for some reason, we still have 2 VMs from the rest of the 2 availability zones. Similarly, if there is an update or a patch to be applied, azure schedules these at different times for different availability zones. So this means, we have just one of the availability zones affected while the update is being applied. The rest of the 2 zones are unaffected."

The VM size property can be modified by a runbook that is triggered by metrics, but you can schedule it monthly.\n\nC: Scheduled vertical scaling could be a solution, but then you don't need a scheduled runbook and it states that it does not support multiple active instances. Scale Set is not a n option.\n\nE: DSC is only useful to keep the resources on a VM (OS, File shares, etc.) in a consistent state, not to change VM properties.\n\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://www.apress.com/us/blog/all-blog-posts/scale-up-azure-vms/15823864#:~:text=If%20you%20select%20the%20option,to%20the%20next%20larger%20size"

AI answer to this is as follows:\nResizing an Individual VM:\nWhen you change the size (SKU) of an individual VM within the VMSS (e.g., from a smaller size to a larger one), only that specific VM is resized.\nThe other VMs in the VMSS remain unaffected.\nThe resized VM may need to be restarted to apply the new size.\nIn summary, resizing an individual VM within a VMSS does not automatically resize all VMs in the set. You\u2019ll need to manage each VM\u2019s size independently. \nSo the answer is 1 for Box 1. \n Box 2= 1\nAutomatic OS updates update 20% of the VMs at once, with a minimum of 1 VM instance at a time.

We can easily revert the deployment by swapping back.\n\nDeployment slots are live apps with their own host names. App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.\n\nDeploying your application to a non-production slot has the following benefits:\n\n1.\tYou can validate app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot.\n2.\tDeploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production makes sure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production.\n\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots"

This will ensure that NGINX is available on all virtual machines after they are deployed, and it will also help you maintain consistency in your configuration.

Duration value is only used for data range - how much data autoscaling system has to aggregate to determine if rule applies or not. Cooldown - how much time has to pass before next autoscale operation to trigger. So once you start you app the first autoscale may happen not earlier than after duration value (because you need specific data range). Each next will happen every cooldown value. So:\n- first scale out will happen after 10 minutes (duration value)\n- next scale out will happen after 15 minutes (+5 minutes of cooldown)\nTherefore answer for first question is 3 instances\n\nSecond one is simpler. Scaling operation just happened. So next scaling may happen after cooldown time which is 5 minutes."

When it's said \"Cooldown - how much time has to pass before next autoscale operation to trigger\", the correct term is: \"Cooldown - how much time has to pass before next RULE CHECK to DETERMINE IF ANOTHER AUTOSCALE OPERATION WILL trigger\". Imagine the scenario that it's 80% cpu for 14 minutes and 69% for 1 minute. There will be 1 check for rule that results in scale out in minute 10, 5 min cooldown, then on minute 15 there will be another check for the rule, which will consider data range from minute 5 up to minute 15. In this time range will eventually result in an average CPU still greater than 70% (9 minutes 80% + 1 minute 69%). So the core point to observe is that there are checking for rules on a set time range, scaling out operation happening (or not) is a result of the checking of the rule."

Using VMs of a different generation than the gallery can lead to compatibility issues and may not be supported, as the underlying hardware and virtualization technology can vary between different VM generations.\nVM2 matches the region and vm generation. While it's not strictly required to match the CPU recommendation, it's a best practice to use an image source with CPU settings that align well with your workload. If you anticipate using VM instances with varying CPU capabilities, consider testing the image source in different VM sizes to ensure it functions as expected. So in short words this isn't a deal breaker.\nVM3 is in a different region and compute gallery's are associated with the specific region you create them in.

Decrease the resource limit of container2 to two CPUs.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nIn this scenario, container2 has a resource request of 3 CPUs and a resource limit of 4 CPUs, while container1 has both a request and a limit of 2 CPUs.\nSince container2 has a higher resource request (3 CPUs) than container1 (2 CPUs), it could potentially starve container1 of the CPU resources it needs, especially if the CPU load increases.\nBy decreasing the resource limit of container2 to 2 CPUs, you ensure that both containers have equal access to CPU resources (i.e., 2 CPUs each), preventing container2 from consuming more resources than necessary and negatively impacting container1."

The resource limit of container 2 must be 3 or greater.\nOption B is wrong as well. The maximum resource limit you can set for a container instance is the total resources allocated to the group. Thus, maximum request limit of container2 is 5. Also, Resource limit of container2 is 4. Container2 could use up to 4 CPUs that will negatively impact container1. Increase it 6 CPUs will make the situation even worse.\nOption A can not stop container2 use up to 4 CPUs."
