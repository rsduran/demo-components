But the difference is SendGrid Action is used to send an email synchronously, while SendGrid binding is used to send an email asynchronously. \n\nIt means that SendGrid Action will block the execution of the function app until the email has been sent. This can lead to increased compute costs, especially if you are sending a large number of emails. On the other way, SendGrid binding  will not block while the email is being sent. This can help to reduce compute costs, as the function app can continue to process other requests while the email is being sent.\n\nQuestion is \"You need to eunsure that compute cost is reduced\".

Basic authentication sends the user's credentials in plain text over the network, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This is not suitable for public facing APIs.\n\nA more secure solution would be to use OAuth2 or OpenID Connect protocol for back-end authentication. This allows the API Management service to securely authenticate the client against an identity provider, such as Azure Active Directory, and obtain an access token for the back-end service.\n\nIn summary, configuring Basic gateway credentials for the Azure resource does not meet the goal of securing back-end authentication for the public facing API."

You want to be able to filter events specifically for this purpose.\n\nOption D will fulfill these requirements. By adding a subject prefix to sign-out events and creating an Azure Event Grid subscription that is configured to use the subjectBeginsWith filter, you can specifically target and process the sign-out events quickly. The subjectBeginsWith filter allows for efficient filtering of events, which aligns with the requirement of processing sign-outs as fast as possible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
