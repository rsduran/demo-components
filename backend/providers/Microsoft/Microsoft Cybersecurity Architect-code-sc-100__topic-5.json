    "answerDescription": "Box 1: Microsoft defender for cloud<br>Scenario: Prevent AD DS user accounts from being locked out by brute force attacks that target Azure AD user accounts.<br>When Microsoft Defender for Cloud detects a Brute-force attack, it triggers an alert to bring you awareness that a brute force attack took place. The automation uses this alert as a trigger to block the traffic of the IP by creating a security rule in the NSG attached to the VM to deny inbound traffic from the IP addresses attached to the alert. In the alerts of this type, you can find the attacking IP address appearing in the 'entities' field of the alert.<br>Box 2: An account lockout policy in AD DS<br>Scenario:<br>Detect brute force attacks that directly target AD DS user accounts.<br>Smart lockout helps lock out bad actors that try to guess your users' passwords or use brute-force methods to get in. Smart lockout can recognize sign-ins that come from valid users and treat them differently than ones of attackers and other unknown sources. Attackers get locked out, while your users continue to access their accounts and be productive.<br>Verify on-premises account lockout policy<br>To verify your on-premises AD DS account lockout policy, complete the following steps from a domain-joined system with administrator privileges:<br>1. Open the Group Policy Management tool.<br>2. Edit the group policy that includes your organization's account lockout policy, such as, the Default Domain Policy.<br>3. Browse to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Account Policies &gt; Account Lockout Policy.<br>4. Verify your Account lockout threshold and Reset account lockout counter after values.<br>Reference:<br>https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/automation-to-block-brute-force-attacked-ip-detected-by/ba-p/1616825 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-smart-lockout#verify-on-premises-account-lockout-policy",

A key element of DevSecOps is data-driven, event-driven processes. These processes help teams identify, evaluate, and respond to potential risks. Many organizations choose to integrate alerts and usage data into their IT service management (ITSM) platform. The team can then bring the same structured workflow to security events that they use for other incidents and requests."

This two-way conversation gives us two important capabilities. The relying party can see when properties change, like network location, and tell the token issuer. It also gives the token issuer a way to tell the relying party to stop respecting tokens for a given user because of account compromise, disablement, or other concerns. The mechanism for this conversation is continuous access evaluation (CAE).

It protects backup data from accidental or malicious deletes for 14 days at no additional cost, allowing the recovery of that backup item before it\u2019s permanently lost. We recommend not to disable this feature. If backups are deleted and soft delete isn\u2019t enabled, you or Microsoft can\u2019t recover the deleted backup data.

        "content": "Deleted backups:\n\nC. Multi-user authorization by using Resource Guard\nResource Guard is a feature in Azure Backup that can provide an additional layer of protection for your backup data. It requires more than one person (multi-user authorization) to perform critical operations like deleting backup data, which helps protect against the risk of a compromised administrator account being used to delete backups.\n\nDisabled backups:\n\nD. Soft delete of backups\nSoft delete provides a retention period for deleted backups, meaning that even if backups are deleted (either accidentally or maliciously), they are retained for a set period (by default 14 days) and can be recovered during that time. This can protect against a compromised account attempting to disable backups on the MARS agent before encrypting the servers, as you would still have a window to recover those backups."
