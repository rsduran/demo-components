In this list, the order of the labels is important because it reflects their priority. You want your most restrictive sensitivity label, such as Highly Confidential, to appear at the bottom of the list, and your least restrictive sensitivity label, such as Public, to appear at the top.\nYou can apply just one sensitivity label to an item such as a document, email, or container. If you set an option that requires your users to provide a justification for changing a label to a lower classification, the order of this list identifies the lower classifications. However, this option does not apply to sublabels.\nThe ordering of sublabels is used with automatic labeling, though. When you configure labels to be applied automatically or as a recommendation, multiple matches can result for more than one label. To determine the label to apply or recommend, the label ordering is used: The last sensitive label is selected, and then if applicable, the last sublabel."

If the signed-in user is a global administrator, your app can update the profile of every user in the organization. However, if the signed-in user doesn't have an administrator role, your app can update only the profile of the signed-in user. It can't update the profiles of other users in the organization because the user that it has permission to act on behalf of doesn't have those privileges. This is \"On-Behalf of\" permission which ques mentioned."

It will create the user in sys.principals and it will calculate the SID based on the origin. For exaple if you have a user assigned identity, its the object Id or when sing sql data package &gt; 3.0 its client id. When suing system assigned identity its using the name and calculates the SID. if you use SQL Management Studio it will do the sid calculation for you.\n\nAnyway, the keyvault doesnt make sense due to different RG. But is we store a connectionstring in keyvault that is using a contained user, it could work. Not the most secure way btw.. So now the question MI or service endpoint? Service endpoint is not enough, MI will work although the question is kind of messed up."

Further, it allows you to better manage your permissions to allow granular access control. Doing this requires synching identities from on-premises AD DS to Azure AD using either the on-premises Azure AD Connect sync application or Azure AD Connect cloud sync, a lightweight agent that can be installed from the Azure Active Directory Admin Center. You assign share-level permissions to hybrid identities synced to Azure AD while managing file/directory-level access using Windows ACLs."

This approach is fine for stable IP addresses that are outside the Azure private network. However, virtual machines (VMs) within the Azure private network are configured with dynamic IP addresses. Dynamic IP addresses can change when your VM is restarted and in turn invalidate the IP-based firewall rule. It would be folly to specify a dynamic IP address in a firewall rule, in a production environment.\nYou can work around this limitation by obtaining a static IP address for your VM. For details, see Create a virtual machine with a static public IP address using the Azure portal. However, the static IP approach can become difficult to manage, and it's costly when done at scale.\nVirtual network rules are easier alternative to establish and to manage access from a specific subnet that contains your VMs."
