This effectively filters the events to only include failed logon events from the specified devices.\n\nThe summarize clause counts the number of events that match the previous criteria, grouping the results by DeviceName and LogonType. The count() function counts the number of events in each group, and the LogonFailures alias is used to label this count in the resulting output."

        "content": "Activity from infrequent country is the correct answer.\n\nFirst, both \"Impossible travel\" and \"Activity from infrequent country\" are detection rule that help prevent breaches from foreign attackers. \n\nThe difference between the rule is the type of historical data. \"Impossible travel\" actually compares between the new location's sign-in with the last known one. So it basically means if someone already logged into a location (corporate network with USA-based IP range) and now he is logged into a China network then it is likely the user is compromised (assume the organization doesn't have any traffic/record/association with China network).  Moreover it is based on geographically distant locations within a time period shorter. So in my example China is too far from USA.\n\n\"Activity from infrequent country\" is a bit different. Instead of comparing with the last known location, it detects if an account is logged in from a country that has never been accessed by any user in the organization. This rule is based on user behavior using entity behavioral analytics and machine learning."

RegEx pattern matching\n\nTo detect sensitive documents in SharePoint Online, you can use a RegEx (regular expression) pattern matching rule in the data loss prevention (DLP) policy. A RegEx pattern is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, which can be used to match specific sequences of characters in the documents.\n\nIn this scenario, you can use a RegEx pattern to match the customer account numbers, which consist of 32 alphanumeric characters. By using a RegEx pattern, you can accurately identify the sensitive documents that contain the customer account numbers and take appropriate action, such as blocking access to the documents or sending notifications to the appropriate users.\n\nOnce you have defined the RegEx pattern, you can create a DLP policy in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that uses the pattern to detect sensitive documents. The DLP policy can then be configured to take appropriate action, such as blocking access to the sensitive documents or sending notifications to the appropriate users."

This effectively creates a join between the two tables based on the SHA256 field, linking the attachments with file events on devices.\n\nThe project operator selects the desired fields from the joined results and includes them in the final output.\n\nThis query will work in both Microsoft Defender and Azure Sentinel, as it is a valid advanced hunting query in both platforms."

The CIDR notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated routing prefix. It consists of an IP address followed by a slash and the number of bits in the prefix1.\n\nThe IP address range of 171.23.34.32-171.23.34.63 can be represented by the CIDR notation of 171.23.34.32/27, which means that the first 27 bits of the IP address are fixed and the remaining 5 bits can vary2. This covers 32 possible IP addresses, from 171.23.34.32 to 171.23.34.63.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Select Add indicator and set the IP address to 171.23.34.32/27"

While user enrichment can be beneficial, it is not directly related to investigating threats using the unified audit log.\n\nB. The Azure connector is generally used for connecting Defender for Cloud Apps to Azure services. It is not specifically related to investigating threats in the unified audit log.\n\nC. Configuring the Office 365 connector allows Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to collect and analyze audit logs, which are vital for investigating and responding to security threats.\n\nD. While automatic log upload settings are important for ensuring that the logs are regularly uploaded, it's the configuration of the specific connectors (such as the Office 365 connector) that determines which logs are collected and made available for investigation."

Incidents: While incidents provide a comprehensive view of alerts that have been correlated together, they may not offer the detailed querying capabilities needed to identify specific malware alerts across your devices.\nB. Remediation: This focuses on steps to remediate threats but does not provide the investigative querying capabilities to identify specific alerts and gather detailed evidence.\nC. Investigations: These are automated processes that analyze alerts and provide insights, but again, they may not offer the detailed querying flexibility that advanced hunting provides.\nD. Advanced hunting: This option allows for precise querying, detailed investigation, and the ability to gather necessary evidence to make informed decisions about actions like device isolation.\nThus, for identifying devices that triggered a malware alert and collecting the related evidence to potentially isolate the affected devices, D) Advanced hunting is the most appropriate tool in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal."

Thank you for pointing that out!\n\nTo achieve this, you would use an advanced hunting query in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
