This is because the process involves accessing data from an internally created web application with basic REST API functionality. A custom connector can be used to interact with the API and retrieve the necessary data.\nFor Process 2, I recommend using an Unattended UI flow (b). This process involves accessing data from a public website with no API functionality. An unattended UI flow can automate the process of extracting data from the website, even when the process is running in an unmonitored queue. This is particularly useful for processes that need to run without human intervention, such as nightly batch jobs or processes that run on a schedule."

The ISV would then move that dataflow and destination tables to a test environment to test with their test data source to validate that the solution works well and is ready for production. After testing completes, the ISV would provide the dataflow and tables to clients who will import them into their production environment to operate on client's data.

While it can implement complex business logic and be called from various contexts, it doesn\u2019t inherently return a value after execution, which is a requirement in your scenario.\nCustom API: This provides more flexibility and control. It allows you to define custom operations that can be invoked from Dataverse actions, work across multiple tables, and return values upon completion. This makes it a better fit for your needs, especially since you need the operation to return a value and be callable from an existing Dataverse action.\nSo, a Custom API is recommended because it meets all your requirements: working across multiple tables, returning a value, and being callable from existing actions."

Power Automate allows you to create automated workflows between your apps, services, and data to automate repetitive tasks and streamline business processes, including sending emails. By using Power Automate, you can easily integrate your canvas app with your email service, and configure the necessary triggers and actions to send emails with the click of a button.\n\nClassic workflows (A) are a deprecated feature of Dynamics 365, and they are not available in canvas apps. Azure Logic Apps (C) are similar to Power Automate cloud flows, but they are primarily used for enterprise integration scenarios and not for app development. Business process flows (D) are used to guide users through a set of stages and steps to complete a specific business process, and they do not provide the capability to send emails."

This is useful for implementing rollback logic, such as deleting items that were created if subsequent actions fail.\n\n\nC.
