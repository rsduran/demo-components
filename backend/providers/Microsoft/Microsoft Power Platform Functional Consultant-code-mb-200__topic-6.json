For example, after one week since the optimization was applied, the value that appears can help indicate whether an optimization has improved or degraded query performance for the given entity. A negative value suggests an improvement in query performance, whereas a positive number suggests a degradation in query performance. So, an optimization applied one week ago that has a value of -10% suggests a 10 percent improvement in query performance.\nref : https://portal.dynamics365support.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01217/en-us"

If they're using it offline then you can't really help them to get the latest data until they go back online so the answer would be none.  But it also says on \"commuters\" (which I presume is a typo of \"computers\") alongside phones and tablets.  If they're remote and can't get the latest info via a computer browser, I'm not sure what would help them!!!  I'm not sure what the answer is and hope to not encounter this question on my exam!"
