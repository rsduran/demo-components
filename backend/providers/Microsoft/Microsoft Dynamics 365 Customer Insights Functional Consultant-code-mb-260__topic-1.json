Marketing<br><br>The marketing team manages an informational website and is responsible for running campaigns through web advertising platforms and social media channels. The marketing team also produces a weekly email newsletter that contains educational content relevant to dog owners as well as promotions for Contoso\u2019s services and products.<br><br>Contoso uses a third-party marketing automation platform to send email and SMS messages to customers. These communications currently include:<br><br>1. All unique email addresses from the booking system, ecommerce system and Dynamics 365 Customer Service receive the weekly email newsletter described above. The same customer will receive multiple emails if the customer is associated with different email addresses in different systems.<br>2. Customers receive SMS reminders the day before a scheduled grooming appointment.<br>3. Each customer who purchases grooming services is sent an email with a link to a satisfaction survey on the first Tuesday following the grooming appointment. The survey link is the same for all customers, and the survey requires customers to enter their names, phone numbers and (optionally) email addresses as part of the submission.<br><br>Customer Service and Marketing Overview.

The leadership team is also considering partnering with other organizations to offer related services like dog training and dog walking to its existing customers.<br>3.

Marketing<br><br>The marketing team manages an informational website and is responsible for running campaigns through web advertising platforms and social media channels. The marketing team also produces a weekly email newsletter that contains educational content relevant to dog owners as well as promotions for Contoso\u2019s services and products.<br><br>Contoso uses a third-party marketing automation platform to send email and SMS messages to customers. These communications currently include:<br><br>1. All unique email addresses from the booking system, ecommerce system and Dynamics 365 Customer Service receive the weekly email newsletter described above. The same customer will receive multiple emails if the customer is associated with different email addresses in different systems.<br>2. Customers receive SMS reminders the day before a scheduled grooming appointment.<br>3. Each customer who purchases grooming services is sent an email with a link to a satisfaction survey on the first Tuesday following the grooming appointment. The survey link is the same for all customers, and the survey requires customers to enter their names, phone numbers and (optionally) email addresses as part of the submission.<br><br>Customer Service and Marketing Overview.

The AdventureWorks Cycles business model supports both in-store purchases, as well as online orders. In addition to offering a wide variety of bicycles, the company sells clothing, performance nutrition supplements, and bicycle parts. The company also offers bicycle fitting and repair services.<br><br>The customer base varies from professional cyclists, individual leisure riders to families. The business recently experienced unprecedented growth of over 2000 percent, bringing the total number of customers to 10,000. The company decided to invest in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights and Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app to unify customer data and improve sales.<br><br>Data Sources. ADVCUSTOMERS Common Data Model Folder<br><br>AdventureWorks uses Microsoft Azure Data Factory pipelines to export demographic data from its customer loyalty, ecommerce and cycling club membership management systems to a Common Data Model (CDM) folder named ADVCUSTOMERS that is stored in a Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen 2 container named ADVDEMO9345 in the West USA region.<br><br>The following list describes the entities in this CDM folder:<br>\u2022\tLoyaltyMember - contains customer profile information associated with in-store purchases. o\tIt includes the following attributes: srcid (primary key), firstname, lastname, fullname, addressstreet, city, postalcode, state, homephone, emailaddress, datecreated, timestamp<br>\u2022\tEcommerceCustomer - contains customer profile information from online purchases. o\tIt includes the following attributes: ecid (primary key), firstname, last name, fullname, emailaddress, homephone, streetaddress, city, postalcode, state, datecreated, timestamp<br>\u2022\tClubMember - contains profile information for cycling club members. o\tIt includes the following attributes: ccic (primary key) fullname, emailaddress, streetaddress1, city, postal_code, state, datecreated, timestamp<br>\u2022\tSurveyResponse - contains customer satisfaction scores on a scale from 1-10 (1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied). o\tIt includes the following attributes: svid (primary key), emailaddress, responsedate, score.<br><br>Data Sources. WEBSTATS Common Data Model Folder<br><br>AdventureWorks\u2019 website page views for authenticated ecommerce customers and cycling club members are stored in a CDM folder named WEBSTATS that is stored in an Azure Data Lake Gen 2 container named WEBDATA119 in the Central US region.<br><br>This folder contains an entity named PageViews that includes the following fields: emailaddress, pageurl. visitdate, productcategory.<br><br>Data Sources. Additional Information<br><br>AdventureWorks uses Dynamics 365 Sales as its sales CRM application, and its data is stored in Microsoft Dataverse.<br><br>Cycling club event logistics and member attendance are managed in an Azure SQL database. Attendance is tracked in a single table named EventAttendee that includes the following fields: emailaddress, eventdate, eventaddress, eventcity, eventstate, eventpostalcode, lastupdated (timestamp).<br><br>The ClubMember entity contains records of existing customers, as well as individuals who have not made a purchase from AdventureWorks. There are approximately 500,000 records in this entity, and there are approximately 5 million records in the EventAttendee table.<br><br><br>Current Configuration -<br><br>AdventureWorks currently has a single Dynamics 365 Customer Insights environment. This environment is named ADWProd, and it is configured as a B-to-C production environment in the West USA region.<br><br>The following data sources have been configured:<br>1. To ingest the LoyaltyMember, EcommerceCustomer and ClubMember entities described in the Data Sources section of this case study.<br>2. For Dynamics 365 Sales contact records using a Dataverse managed data lake connector.<br>3. For the EventAttendee table using a Power Query connection.<br><br>Profile unification has been configured to perform map, match and merge for non-primary key attributes with identical semantic types from the LoyaltyMember, EcommerceCustomer and ClubMember entities. Creation dates and timestamps were intentionally left unmapped. Some additional attributes were accidentally excluded from the merge process. These attributes are listed in the Pain Points section of this case study.<br><br>The search and filter index has been configured to include FullName, City, State and PhoneNumber as search fields. The State field is enabled tor filtering based on frequency and will show up to 10 options.<br><br>All members of the AdventureWorks marketing team have been granted access to the ADWProd environment.<br><br><br>Pain Points -<br><br>The AdventureWorks leadership team has identified several issues that need to be addressed to support current growth and ensure customer satisfaction.<br><br>1. Attributes for first name and postal code were included in the mapping process, but they were accidentally excluded from the merge process.<br>2. Multiple copies of printed catalogs are being sent to members of the same household resulting in wasted printing and mailing costs.<br>3. A segment export to Dynamics 365 Sales has been configured, but the sales team reports the associated marketing lists has zero members.<br>4. Ingesting the EventAttendee table takes significantly longer than ingesting any other data source, and it causes significant delays for completion of scheduled refreshes.<br><br><br>Goals and Objectives -<br><br>1. The marketing team wants to start hosting invitation-only webinars to promote upcoming product launches. Invitations for these webinars should be restricted to customers who have responded favorably to a customer satisfaction survey.<br>2. The marketing team wants to email coupons to customers based on the types of products they view on the AdventureWorks website.<br>3. The IT operations team wants to minimize the amount of time required to complete a scheduled refresh.<br><br><br>Detailed Requirements -<br><br>1. Only one copy of a catalog should be sent per household. AdventureWorks defines a household as all customers who share the same last name, street address, city and state.<br>2. Sales users are expected to call customers who are included in the loyalty system but do not have a populated email address in the loyalty system.<br>3. All marketing emails must include the customer's first name in the subject field, if it is available in the source data.<br>4. Marketing team members must be able to search for customer profiles in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights by full name, email address, phone number, city, state, and postal code.<br>5. All members of the marketing team who can access a production Dynamics 365 Customer Insights environment should also have access to its corresponding testing environment.<br>6. Data exports and scheduled refreshes are not allowed in test environments.<br><br><br>You want to address the IT operations team\u2019s goal.<br><br>What is the first step you should take?",
