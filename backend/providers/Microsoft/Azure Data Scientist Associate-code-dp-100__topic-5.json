When you compare models, they are ranked by the metric you select for evaluation.<br>Mean absolute error (MAE) measures how close the predictions are to the actual outcomes; thus, a lower score is better.<br>Root mean squared error (RMSE) creates a single value that summarizes the error in the model. By squaring the difference, the metric disregards the difference between over-prediction and under-prediction.<br>Relative absolute error (RAE) is the relative absolute difference between expected and actual values; relative because the mean difference is divided by the arithmetic mean.<br>Relative squared error (RSE) similarly normalizes the total squared error of the predicted values by dividing by the total squared error of the actual values.<br>Mean Zero One Error (MZOE) indicates whether the prediction was correct or not. In other words: ZeroOneLoss(x,y) = 1 when x!=y; otherwise 0.<br>Coefficient of determination, often referred to as R2, represents the predictive power of the model as a value between 0 and 1. Zero means the model is random<br>(explains nothing); 1 means there is a perfect fit. However, caution should be used in interpreting R2 values, as low values can be entirely normal and high values can be suspect.<br>AUC.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/evaluate-model",

A high AUC value indicates that the model has a strong ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances, which is especially important in imbalanced datasets where one class may have significantly fewer instances than the other.

Add L1/L2 regularization: Regularization techniques can help to reduce overfitting in a neural network. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to learn simpler and smoother weight values. This, in turn, helps to prevent overfitting.\n\nC. Use training data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by creating new examples from existing data. This can help the model to generalize better and reduce overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include random rotations, flips, and translations.\n\nOptions A and E suggest adding additional dense layers, which can increase the complexity of the model and potentially exacerbate overfitting. Option D suggests reducing the amount of training data, which can lead to underfitting and poor generalization performance. Therefore, options B and C are the best choices for reducing overfitting and improving model performance."
