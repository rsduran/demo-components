To answer, drag the appropriate services to the correct locations. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

Several law enforcement organizations may respond to speeding vehicles.<br><br>Telemetry Capture -<br>The telemetry capture system records each time a vehicle passes in front of a sensor. The sensors run on a custom embedded operating system and record the following telemetry data:<br>\u2711 Time<br>\u2711 Location in latitude and longitude<br>\u2711 Speed in kilometers per hour (kmph)<br>\u2711 Length of vehicle in meters<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-databricks/what-is-azure-databricks<br>Design data processing solutions",

If given that would have been the best answer.\n\nComing to why Azure Server. Below is what the case study states and storage doesn't support query language\n\nRequirement :The solution must allow for searches of vehicle images by license plate to support law enforcement investigations. Searches must be able to be performed using a query language and must support fuzzy searches to compensate for license plate detection errors.\n\n\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/stream-processing-databricks"
