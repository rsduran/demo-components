Jetstress can be configured to test the maximum I/O throughput available to your disk subsystem within the required performance constraints of Exchange, or it can accept a desired profile of user count and I/Os per second per user and validate that the disk subsystem is capable of maintaining an acceptable level of performance with such a profile. Jetstress testing can be used to validate storage reliability and performance prior to the deployment of Exchange servers. You should run Jetstress if you are concerned about your storage subsystem performance or if you need to determine a system's I/O capacity.<br>The Load Generator (LoadGen) tool is designed to produce a simulated client workload against a test Exchange deployment. This workload can be used to evaluate how Exchange performs, and can also be used to analyze the effect of various configuration changes on Exchange behavior and performance while the system is under load<br>Use the output from these tests in the following ways:<br>\u2711 Validate deployments<br>\u2711 Calculate the client computer response time for the server configuration under client load<br>\u2711 Estimate the number of users per server<br>\u2711 Identify bottlenecks on the server<br>References: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335108(v=exchg.141).aspx",
