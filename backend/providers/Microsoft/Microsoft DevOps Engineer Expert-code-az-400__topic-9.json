(On macOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, container jobs are not available.) Containers provide isolation from the host and allow you to pin specific versions of tools and dependencies. Host jobs require less initial setup and infrastructure to maintain.\n\nContainers offer a lightweight abstraction over the host operating system. You can select the exact versions of operating systems, tools, and dependencies that your build requires. When you specify a container in your pipeline, the agent will first fetch and start the container. Then, each step of the job will run inside the container. You can't have nested containers. Containers aren't supported when an agent is already running inside a container."

However, in the context of your issue \u2014 intermittent failures in TestSuite1 that are not related to changes in the source code or the execution environment \u2014 increasing code coverage may not directly address the problem.\n\nIntermittent test failures, especially when they are unrelated to code changes, often point to issues such as flaky tests, timing issues, resource constraints, or external dependencies that may be unreliable.

This is necessary because you're changing the routing method from performance to geographic.\nConfigure geographic routing:\nChange the routing method of ATM1 from performance to geographic. The Geographic routing method allows you to direct users to specific endpoints based on where their DNS queries originate from geographically.\nAdd new endpoints that have geographic region mapping:\nCreate new endpoints and map them to specific geographic regions.

This lets you monitor and test new releases to ensure functionality before full deployment. It also provides control over the number of users that will receive the new code releases, satisfying both requirements."
