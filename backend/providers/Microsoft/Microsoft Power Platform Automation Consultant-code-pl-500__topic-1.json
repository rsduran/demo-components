However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.<br><br>To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.<br>At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.<br><br>To start the case study:<br>To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.<br><br>Background:<br>City Power and Light is one of the biggest energy companies in North America. They extract, produce and transport oil. The company has more than 50 offices and 100 oil extraction facilities throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. They use railways, trucks, and pipelines to move oil and gas from their facilities.<br><br>The company provides the following services:<br>* Produce oil from oil sands safely, responsibly, and reliably.<br>* Refine crude of into high-quality products.<br>* Develop and manage wind power facilities.<br>* Transport oil to different countries/regions.<br>City Power and Light uses various Microsoft software products to manage is daily actives and run its machine-critical applications.<br><br>Maintenance Tasks:<br>A user named Admin1 creates a cloud flow named ManagePipelineMaintenanceTasks. Admin1 applies a data loss prevention (DLP) policy to the flow. Admin1 shares the flow with a user named PipelineManager1 as co-owner. You must determine the actions that PipelineManager1 can perform.<br><br>Maintenance Scheduler:<br>You create a cloud flow that uses a desktop flow. The desktop flow connects to third-party services to fetch information. You must not permit the desktop flow to run for more than 20&nbsp;minutes.<br><br>You must configure sharing for MaintenanceScheduler to meet the following requirements:<br>* User1 must be able to work with you to modify the desktop flow.<br>* User2 must be able to access and review the run history for the flow.<br>* You must grant User3 permissions to run but not modify the desktop flow.<br><br>ERPDataOperations flow:<br>City Power and light uses an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The ERP system does not have an API.<br>Each day the company receives an email that contains an attachment. The attachment lists orders from the company\u2019s rail transportation partners. You must create an automation solution that reads the contents of the email and writes records to the ERP system. The solution must pass credential from a cloud flow to a desktop flow.<br><br>RailStatusUpdater:<br>City Power and Light actively monitors all products in transit. You must create a flow named RailStatusUpdater that manages communications with railways that transport the company\u2019s products. RailStatusUpdater includes five desktop flow actions.<br><br>You must run the desktop flows in attended mode during testing. You must run the desktop flows in unattended mode after you deploy the solution. You must minimize administrative efforts.<br><br>Packaging:<br>You must package the automations in a solution. All required components must be included in the solution.<br><br>ProductionMonitor flow:<br>You create a cloud flow named ProductionMonitor which uses the Manually trigger a flow trigger. You plan to trigger ProductionMonitor from a cloud flow named ProdManager.<br><br>You add a Run a Child flow action in ProdManager to trigger ProductionMonitor. When you attempt to save ProdManager the following error message displays:<br>Request to XRM API failed with error: 'Message:Flow client error returned with status code \"Bad request\" and details \"(\"error\":<br>{\"code\":ChildFlowUnsupportedForinvokerConnections\", \"message\": The workflow with id 8d3bcde7-7e98-eb11-b1ac-000d3a32d53f\", named FlowA cannot be used as a child workflow because child workflows only support embedded connections. \"}}\"Code\" 0x80060467 InnerError.'<br><br>CapacityPlanning flow:<br>Developers within the company use could flows to access data from an on-premises capacity planning system.<br>You observe significant increases to the volume of traffic that the on-premises data gateway processes each day. You must minimize gateway failures.<br><br>DataCollector flow:<br>You have a desktop flow that interacts with a web form. The flow must write data to several fields on the form.<br>You are testing the flow. The flow fails when attempting to write data to any field on the web form.<br><br>RailStatusUpdater flow:<br>The RailStatusUpdater flow occasionally fails due to machine connection errors. You can usually get the desktop flow to complete by resubmitting the cloud flow run. You must automate the retry process to ensure that you do not need to manually resubmit the cloud flow when machine connection errors occur.<br><br>You need to resolve the issue with the DataCollector flow.<br>What are two possible ways to achieve the goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.<br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.",

The company has 33 offices and 12 warehouses across the US, Mexico, and Canada. As their customers\u2019 needs grow in sophistication, Contoso wants to delight customers with breakthrough products, exceptional service, and on-time delivery of materials. They want to automate time consuming and manual processes that are prone to error. Contoso wants to consolidate and automate ordering and fulfillment processes.<br><br>\u2022\tThe company has a fleet of 500 delivery trucks. The company has 150 drivers and uses third-party contractors to deliver goods.<br>\u2022\tThe company has 400 warehouse workers and 30 finance clerks.<br>\u2022\tContoso has 85 sales representatives and 50 customer service representatives. Sales representatives spend most of their time on the road visiting customers or prospects.<br>\u2022\tThe IT department consists of four system administrators and six system analysts.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br><br>Overview<br> -<br>Contoso Pharmaceuticals has a custom enterprise resource management (ERP) system. It is difficult to integrate other applications and services with the system. Office staff manually key in purchase orders, customer orders, and invoices after they receive a scan or hard copy of an agreement.<br><br><br>Applications<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tThe company uses a custom supplier management system named SMSApps that runs on each user\u2019s workstation. The system is costly to run and maintain. SMSApp does not have an API.<br>\u2022\tSales representatives manage customer requests by using Dynamics 365 Sales.<br>\u2022\tContoso has Microsoft Power Platform development, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production environments.<br>\u2022\tAdministrators create one Accounts Payable (AP) mailbox for each environment to support testing.<br>\u2022\tThe use of a DLP policy and Desktop Flow development is specified as part of the automation requirements.<br><br><br>Security<br> -<br>You assign all users one or more Microsoft Dataverse security roles.<br><br><br>Business Process<br> -<br><br>1. Sales representatives create quotes by using a Microsoft Word document template. The template allows representatives to include product, quantity, and cost estimation details that will be needed to fulfil an order. The representative converts quotes to a PDF file and emails the file to the customer for approval.<br>2. The sales representative alerts the finance team about the new order and emails the finance team a copy of the quote for processing.<br>3. The finance team prints the quote and manually creates a purchase order (PO) into SMSApp to request materials from a known and trusted vendor.<br>4. The SMSApp distributes the PO to stakeholders. The system sends a copy to a shared finance team mailbox.<br>5. Once a PO is fulfilled by a vendor, the system sends an email to the finance mailbox. The finance team releases an order to the warehouse.<br>6. Materials are shipped from the vendor to one of Contoso\u2019s warehouses. Warehouse workers enter key information from the waybill into SMSApp. The materials are unloaded and racked in the warehouse until they are shipped to customers.<br>7. Upon checking for new daily orders in SMSApp, they see an open order is pending that is awaiting the newly received materials.<br>8. The Warehouse worker loads an order onto a truck for delivery and marks the order as complete in SMSApp.<br>9. Sales representatives provide fulfillment status and tracking information for orders.<br>10. A finance clerk prepares an invoice and sends the invoice to the customer by email. The clerk sends a copy of the email to the shared AP mailbox.<br>11. The AP team monitors the shared mailbox to confirm that the customer has paid the invoice.<br><br><br>Requirements<br> -<br><br><br>Functional requirements<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tLarge volume orders must be processed before other orders.<br>\u2022\tInvoices must be cross-checked with received items against packing slip for shipments.<br>\u2022\tThe finance team must be able to analyze patterns in transactional data to conduct fraud prevention activities.<br>\u2022\tYou must automate the process of entering data about incoming orders into SMSApp.<br>\u2022\tThe solution must follow the principle of least privilege.<br><br><br>Purchase Order Quantity flow<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tYou must create an unmanaged solution to update purchase order details in SMSApp. The flow must use a manual trigger.<br>\u2022\tMembers of Accounts Payable team will be testers for the solution. They must be able to access the Purchase Order Quantity flow.<br><br>Flow for processing invoice data<br><br>\u2022\tYou must create a flow to monitor the AP mailbox. When an invoice arrives as an attachment in the inbox, the flow must automatically process the invoice data by using a form processing model. The flow must cross-check the received items against the packing slip.<br>\u2022\tYou must use different Accounts Payable email addresses for development, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production environments.<br>\u2022\tYou must use an environment variable to represent the Accounts Payable mailbox for the environment in use.<br>\u2022\tYou must be able to use the environment variable across multiple cloud flows, a custom connector, and a canvas app.<br><br><br>Technical requirements<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tUsers must only be allowed to connect to and access systems that are required for the employee to perform required job tasks.<br>\u2022\tAll automation flows must be either co-owned or shared between staff.<br>\u2022\tAll employees must be able to access the new environment to build personal productivity automations.<br>\u2022\tYou must distribute the workload for desktop flows to optimize productivity.<br>\u2022\tA DLP policy must be created and applied to the Development environment.

The company has 33 offices and 12 warehouses across the US, Mexico, and Canada. As their customers\u2019 needs grow in sophistication, Contoso wants to delight customers with breakthrough products, exceptional service, and on-time delivery of materials. They want to automate time consuming and manual processes that are prone to error. Contoso wants to consolidate and automate ordering and fulfillment processes.<br><br>\u2022\tThe company has a fleet of 500 delivery trucks. The company has 150 drivers and uses third-party contractors to deliver goods.<br>\u2022\tThe company has 400 warehouse workers and 30 finance clerks.<br>\u2022\tContoso has 85 sales representatives and 50 customer service representatives. Sales representatives spend most of their time on the road visiting customers or prospects.<br>\u2022\tThe IT department consists of four system administrators and six system analysts.<br><br><br>Current environment -<br><br><br>Overview -<br>Contoso Pharmaceuticals has a custom enterprise resource management (ERP) system. It is difficult to integrate other applications and services with the system. Office staff manually key in purchase orders, customer orders, and invoices after they receive a scan or hard copy of an agreement.<br><br><br>Applications -<br><br>\u2022\tThe company uses a custom supplier management system named SMSApps that runs on each user\u2019s workstation. The system is costly to run and maintain. SMSApp does not have an API.<br>\u2022\tSales representatives manage customer requests by using Dynamics 365 Sales.<br>\u2022\tContoso has Microsoft Power Platform development, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production environments.<br>\u2022\tAdministrators create one Accounts Payable (AP) mailbox for each environment to support testing.<br>\u2022\tThe use of a DLP policy and Desktop Flow development is specified as part of the automation requirements.<br><br><br>Security -<br>You assign all users one or more Microsoft Dataverse security roles.<br><br><br>Business Process -<br><br>1. Sales representatives create quotes by using a Microsoft Word document template. The template allows representatives to include product, quantity, and cost estimation details that will be needed to fulfil an order. The representative converts quotes to a PDF file and emails the file to the customer for approval.<br>2. The sales representative alerts the finance team about the new order and emails the finance team a copy of the quote for processing.<br>3. The finance team prints the quote and manually creates a purchase order (PO) into SMSApp to request materials from a known and trusted vendor.<br>4. The SMSApp distributes the PO to stakeholders. The system sends a copy to a shared finance team mailbox.<br>5. Once a PO is fulfilled by a vendor, the system sends an email to the finance mailbox. The finance team releases an order to the warehouse.<br>6. Materials are shipped from the vendor to one of Contoso\u2019s warehouses. Warehouse workers enter key information from the waybill into SMSApp. The materials are unloaded and racked in the warehouse until they are shipped to customers.<br>7. Upon checking for new daily orders in SMSApp, they see an open order is pending that is awaiting the newly received materials.<br>8. The Warehouse worker loads an order onto a truck for delivery and marks the order as complete in SMSApp.<br>9. Sales representatives provide fulfillment status and tracking information for orders.<br>10. A finance clerk prepares an invoice and sends the invoice to the customer by email. The clerk sends a copy of the email to the shared AP mailbox.<br>11. The AP team monitors the shared mailbox to confirm that the customer has paid the invoice.<br><br><br>Requirements -<br><br><br>Functional requirements -<br><br>\u2022\tLarge volume orders must be processed before other orders.<br>\u2022\tInvoices must be cross-checked with received items against packing slip for shipments.<br>\u2022\tThe finance team must be able to analyze patterns in transactional data to conduct fraud prevention activities.<br>\u2022\tYou must automate the process of entering data about incoming orders into SMSApp.<br>\u2022\tThe solution must follow the principle of least privilege.<br><br><br>Purchase Order Quantity flow -<br><br>\u2022\tYou must create an unmanaged solution to update purchase order details in SMSApp. The flow must use a manual trigger.<br>\u2022\tMembers of Accounts Payable team will be testers for the solution. They must be able to access the Purchase Order Quantity flow.<br><br>Flow for processing invoice data<br><br>\u2022\tYou must create a flow to monitor the AP mailbox. When an invoice arrives as an attachment in the inbox, the flow must automatically process the invoice data by using a form processing model. The flow must cross-check the received items against the packing slip.<br>\u2022\tYou must use different Accounts Payable email addresses for development, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production environments.<br>\u2022\tYou must use an environment variable to represent the Accounts Payable mailbox for the environment in use.<br>\u2022\tYou must be able to use the environment variable across multiple cloud flows, a custom connector, and a canvas app.<br><br><br>Technical requirements -<br><br>\u2022\tUsers must only be allowed to connect to and access systems that are required for the employee to perform required job tasks.<br>\u2022\tAll automation flows must be either co-owned or shared between staff.<br>\u2022\tAll employees must be able to access the new environment to build personal productivity automations.<br>\u2022\tYou must distribute the workload for desktop flows to optimize productivity.<br>\u2022\tA DLP policy must be created and applied to the Development environment.

The company supports small- to medium-sized and enterprise organizations with a range of information technology, project management, change management, and finance management consultancy needs. The organization employs 500 full-time consultants and engages with over 1,000 external contractors to support the delivery of its various projects.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br>The company has been using Microsoft Power Platform for several years and currently has the following implemented:<br><br>\u2022\tA model-driven app named Project Planning Application that is used by the project management office (PMO) team within the company to plan, schedule and collate information for each client project. The application supports the following functionality areas:<br> o\tStorage for project-level information, such as start date, end date and client data.<br> o\tA series of inputs to capture detailed information for statements of work as part of a standard document format. This information is manually entered by the PMO team.<br> o\tInformation regarding internal and external consultants is stored within a custom table called Resources.<br> o\tInformation within the Resources table regarding full-time consultants is typically populated manually by the PMO team. For external consultants, the company regularly attends industry events and collates business cards for potential new employees or external contractors. Information regarding these individuals is then manually entered into the application. The PMO team then asks suitable candidates to complete an application form in Microsoft Word standard format and upload it via a secure URL. Again, the PMO team then manually enters the data into Project Planning Application.<br>\u2022\tA canvas app named Time Entry Application is used by the employees and external contractors to capture the time worked on projects. The application has been configured with the following defined controls:<br> o\tdpStartDate: A date picker control to indicate the start date of the time entry.<br> o\tdpEndDate: A date picker control to indicate the end date of the time entry.<br> o\tinptDescription: A control used to indicate the type of activity and project worked on.<br>\u2022\tA mobile app stores the current user's email address as part of a variable called varUserName.<br><br>The company uses Microsoft SharePoint on premises to store all sensitive documents. Company policy mandates that all client-related documents are stored within this environment only.<br><br>The company uses SAP as its back-end accounting system. The company maintains separate SAP systems in each legal jurisdiction where it is based. The system is relied upon for the following critical business processes:<br>\u2022\tExternal contractors working on a project send their invoices to a dedicated mailbox that is monitored by the company's accounting team. The accounting team must then manually process these invoices into SAP at the end of each month. Due to the number of external contractors, hundreds of invoices must be processes monthly.<br>\u2022\tBasic API access for the SAP system is provided via a mixture of native application APIs and a middleware Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) API hosted on premises. The middleware API supports the ability to post time entries against the relevant projects in any SAP system by specifying the system and client ID as a query parameter in the URL. The middleware API was developed several years ago, and the source code is no longer available. Data is returned in XML format, which can then be analyzed further.<br>\u2022\tWhen a project enters the closure phase, members of the PMO team need to navigate to SAP, enter some details, and then capture information from a PDF that is generated and opened on the screen, such as the final settlement amount. This information is then manually entered into Project Planning Application.<br><br>The company maintains a separate system containing detailed profile information regarding internal employees. The PMO team currently manually enters information from this system into the Resources table. Developers in the company have created a modern REST API for this system, which is actively maintained. The system contains highly sensitive personal information (PI) regarding each employee.<br><br>The company has several on-premises Windows environments that it has identified as suitable for usage because they exist within the same physical network as SAP and the middleware API. These environments must be patched regularly, and all activities targeting these environments must be automated.<br><br><br>Project Planning Application<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tRather than manually populating the statement of work information, users should place it in a SharePoint folder for this information to be extracted and mapped to the correct inputs.<br>\u2022\tA new automation is required to integrate with the profile information system. Because the company plans to consume this data in several ways, a streamlined mechanism for working with the API is required to improve reusability.<br>\u2022\tAn automation is required to handle the project closure steps in SAP and to store the relevant information from SAP into the app.<br>\u2022\tOnce a new candidate uploads a completed application form, information from the form should be copied automatically into Project Planning Application.<br><br><br>Time Entry Application<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tTime Entry Application needs to be extended to integrate alongside SAP, ensuring postings for time entries are processed successfully. When a time entry is submitted, the entry should be posted automatically to SAP.<br>\u2022\tTime entries must always be submitted with relevant text that indicates the type of activity and project worked on.<br>\u2022\tThe automation should be able to detect and handle any errors that occur when posting individual time entries.<br><br><br>Invoice Processing<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tInvoices sent to the account\u2019s mailbox must be processed automatically and created as invoices within SAP.<br><br><br>General<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tDevelopment efforts should be avoided or mitigated when there is native functionality already available.<br>\u2022\tReusability of components is desired to assist citizen developers in creating any solutions in future.<br>\u2022\tAll automation activities should run without disruption during an outage or a patching cycle.<br>\u2022\tUse of username and password credentials should be avoided.<br>\u2022\tAutomations should not rely on human intervention to execute.<br>\u2022\tUse of public cloud file services should be restricted.<br>\u2022\tWhere possible, JSON should be the preferred format when transferring data.<br><br><br>Issues<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tUsers within the PMO team report that it takes many hours to put the data from each business card into the system.<br>\u2022\tYou create the automation to process the time entries, called Submit Time Entry, and add it to the application. Users report issues with the formula used to connect to the automation.<br>\u2022\tDuring a monthly patch cycle, IT support team members cannot identify the correct steps to patch the machine without disrupting any automation.<br>\u2022\tWhile performing an audit of the new solution during the test phase, the company's information security team identifies that users can freely save confidential documents to OneDrive for Business.<br>\u2022\tWhen creating the automation for the project closure process, you discover that some of the required information needs to be exported via the SAP GUI and extracted from a comma-separated value (CSV) file.<br>\u2022\tWhen building the automation for the profile information system, you identify that all requests into the API will fail unless the following HTTP header value is specified:<br> o\tAccept: application/json<br><br><br>You need to recommend a solution to address the requirements and issues.<br><br>Which feature should you recommend?

The company supports small- to medium-sized and enterprise organizations with a range of information technology, project management, change management, and finance management consultancy needs. The organization employs 500 full-time consultants and engages with over 1,000 external contractors to support the delivery of its various projects.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br>The company has been using Microsoft Power Platform for several years and currently has the following implemented:<br><br>\u2022\tA model-driven app named Project Planning Application that is used by the project management office (PMO) team within the company to plan, schedule and collate information for each client project. The application supports the following functionality areas:<br> o\tStorage for project-level information, such as start date, end date and client data.<br> o\tA series of inputs to capture detailed information for statements of work as part of a standard document format. This information is manually entered by the PMO team.<br> o\tInformation regarding internal and external consultants is stored within a custom table called Resources.<br> o\tInformation within the Resources table regarding full-time consultants is typically populated manually by the PMO team. For external consultants, the company regularly attends industry events and collates business cards for potential new employees or external contractors. Information regarding these individuals is then manually entered into the application. The PMO team then asks suitable candidates to complete an application form in Microsoft Word standard format and upload it via a secure URL. Again, the PMO team then manually enters the data into Project Planning Application.<br>\u2022\tA canvas app named Time Entry Application is used by the employees and external contractors to capture the time worked on projects. The application has been configured with the following defined controls:<br> o\tdpStartDate: A date picker control to indicate the start date of the time entry.<br> o\tdpEndDate: A date picker control to indicate the end date of the time entry.<br> o\tinptDescription: A control used to indicate the type of activity and project worked on.<br>\u2022\tA mobile app stores the current user's email address as part of a variable called varUserName.<br><br>The company uses Microsoft SharePoint on premises to store all sensitive documents.

The accounting team must then manually process these invoices into SAP at the end of each month. Due to the number of external contractors, hundreds of invoices must be processes monthly.<br>\u2022\tBasic API access for the SAP system is provided via a mixture of native application APIs and a middleware Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) API hosted on premises. The middleware API supports the ability to post time entries against the relevant projects in any SAP system by specifying the system and client ID as a query parameter in the URL. The middleware API was developed several years ago, and the source code is no longer available.

The company supports small- to medium-sized and enterprise organizations with a range of information technology, project management, change management, and finance management consultancy needs. The organization employs 500 full-time consultants and engages with over 1,000 external contractors to support the delivery of its various projects.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br>The company has been using Microsoft Power Platform for several years and currently has the following implemented:<br><br>\u2022\tA model-driven app named Project Planning Application that is used by the project management office (PMO) team within the company to plan, schedule and collate information for each client project. The application supports the following functionality areas:<br> o\tStorage for project-level information, such as start date, end date and client data.<br> o\tA series of inputs to capture detailed information for statements of work as part of a standard document format. This information is manually entered by the PMO team.<br> o\tInformation regarding internal and external consultants is stored within a custom table called Resources.<br> o\tInformation within the Resources table regarding full-time consultants is typically populated manually by the PMO team. For external consultants, the company regularly attends industry events and collates business cards for potential new employees or external contractors. Information regarding these individuals is then manually entered into the application. The PMO team then asks suitable candidates to complete an application form in Microsoft Word standard format and upload it via a secure URL. Again, the PMO team then manually enters the data into Project Planning Application.<br>\u2022\tA canvas app named Time Entry Application is used by the employees and external contractors to capture the time worked on projects. The application has been configured with the following defined controls:<br> o\tdpStartDate: A date picker control to indicate the start date of the time entry.<br> o\tdpEndDate: A date picker control to indicate the end date of the time entry.<br> o\tinptDescription: A control used to indicate the type of activity and project worked on.<br>\u2022\tA mobile app stores the current user's email address as part of a variable called varUserName.<br><br>The company uses Microsoft SharePoint on premises to store all sensitive documents. Company policy mandates that all client-related documents are stored within this environment only.<br><br>The company uses SAP as its back-end accounting system. The company maintains separate SAP systems in each legal jurisdiction where it is based. The system is relied upon for the following critical business processes:<br>\u2022\tExternal contractors working on a project send their invoices to a dedicated mailbox that is monitored by the company's accounting team. The accounting team must then manually process these invoices into SAP at the end of each month. Due to the number of external contractors, hundreds of invoices must be processes monthly.<br>\u2022\tBasic API access for the SAP system is provided via a mixture of native application APIs and a middleware Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) API hosted on premises. The middleware API supports the ability to post time entries against the relevant projects in any SAP system by specifying the system and client ID as a query parameter in the URL. The middleware API was developed several years ago, and the source code is no longer available. Data is returned in XML format, which can then be analyzed further.<br>\u2022\tWhen a project enters the closure phase, members of the PMO team need to navigate to SAP, enter some details, and then capture information from a PDF that is generated and opened on the screen, such as the final settlement amount. This information is then manually entered into Project Planning Application.<br><br>The company maintains a separate system containing detailed profile information regarding internal employees. The PMO team currently manually enters information from this system into the Resources table. Developers in the company have created a modern REST API for this system, which is actively maintained. The system contains highly sensitive personal information (PI) regarding each employee.<br><br>The company has several on-premises Windows environments that it has identified as suitable for usage because they exist within the same physical network as SAP and the middleware API. These environments must be patched regularly, and all activities targeting these environments must be automated.<br><br><br>Project Planning Application<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tRather than manually populating the statement of work information, users should place it in a SharePoint folder for this information to be extracted and mapped to the correct inputs.<br>\u2022\tA new automation is required to integrate with the profile information system. Because the company plans to consume this data in several ways, a streamlined mechanism for working with the API is required to improve reusability.<br>\u2022\tAn automation is required to handle the project closure steps in SAP and to store the relevant information from SAP into the app.<br>\u2022\tOnce a new candidate uploads a completed application form, information from the form should be copied automatically into Project Planning Application.<br><br><br>Time Entry Application<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tTime Entry Application needs to be extended to integrate alongside SAP, ensuring postings for time entries are processed successfully. When a time entry is submitted, the entry should be posted automatically to SAP.<br>\u2022\tTime entries must always be submitted with relevant text that indicates the type of activity and project worked on.<br>\u2022\tThe automation should be able to detect and handle any errors that occur when posting individual time entries.<br><br><br>Invoice Processing<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tInvoices sent to the account\u2019s mailbox must be processed automatically and created as invoices within SAP.<br><br><br>General<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tDevelopment efforts should be avoided or mitigated when there is native functionality already available.<br>\u2022\tReusability of components is desired to assist citizen developers in creating any solutions in future.<br>\u2022\tAll automation activities should run without disruption during an outage or a patching cycle.<br>\u2022\tUse of username and password credentials should be avoided.<br>\u2022\tAutomations should not rely on human intervention to execute.<br>\u2022\tUse of public cloud file services should be restricted.<br>\u2022\tWhere possible, JSON should be the preferred format when transferring data.<br><br><br>Issues<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tUsers within the PMO team report that it takes many hours to put the data from each business card into the system.<br>\u2022\tYou create the automation to process the time entries, called Submit Time Entry, and add it to the application. Users report issues with the formula used to connect to the automation.<br>\u2022\tDuring a monthly patch cycle, IT support team members cannot identify the correct steps to patch the machine without disrupting any automation.<br>\u2022\tWhile performing an audit of the new solution during the test phase, the company's information security team identifies that users can freely save confidential documents to OneDrive for Business.<br>\u2022\tWhen creating the automation for the project closure process, you discover that some of the required information needs to be exported via the SAP GUI and extracted from a comma-separated value (CSV) file.<br>\u2022\tWhen building the automation for the profile information system, you identify that all requests into the API will fail unless the following HTTP header value is specified:<br> o\tAccept: application/json<br><br><br>You need to build the automation for Time Entry Application.<br><br>Which four actions should you perform in sequence?
