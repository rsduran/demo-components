This could be due to disk I/O contention, slow disk access times, or a lack of available disk space. These issues can cause delays in the migration process, as the migration process relies on the ability to access the data on the Exchange Server quickly.\n\nIt's important to check the disk performance of the Exchange Server, verify that the disk subsystem is functioning properly, and that there is enough free space available. You can use tools like Task Manager, Resource Monitor, or Performance Monitor to monitor the disk latency, disk I/O, and disk space. Additionally, you might want to consider to move the mailboxes in smaller chunks or in off-peak hours to avoid having a high disk contention."
