Identify the shared key by running this PowerShell cmdlet: Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnectionSharedKey.\n\nThis cmdlet retrieves the pre-shared key for the specified Azure site-to-site VPN connection, which can then be compared with the pre-shared key configured on the on-premises VPN device to ensure they match. If the keys don't match, the VPN connection will fail to establish. \n\nThe other options are not as relevant:\n\n- Option B, the cmdlet Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnectionVpnDeviceConfigScript, is used to generate a configuration script for the on-premises VPN device, which is useful, but not the first step in troubleshooting.\n\n- Options C and D refer to certificate files that are relevant in certificate-based authentication scenarios, not a pre-shared key (PSK) authentication scenario, which is typically used in site-to-site VPNs."
