You would just have one provisioned until you hit 30 users - but in that scenario as you say it's depth first.\n\nWhat would make more sense to me is that you would have sufficient hosts powered on to satisfy your expected/normal user load so logins are not delayed by provisioning or powering on - so lets say 3 hosts for 90 sessions - you then want the session load balanced across all hosts, so breadth-first is the way to go.\n\nWhat you are saying is possible, but in my experience it would result in unhappy users if you get 85 people logging on in the morning; anyone beyond user 30 will have session host unavailable whilst their host(s) boot.\n\nWhen you get abnormal user load thats where the auto-scaling kicks in and stands up a new host.\n\nSo the given answer is correct imho."

Now it fills them both upto 30 using whichever is most empty (people can log off as well as on ) . \nIts dumb though because there is no automation to turn the system off again.  So once it triggers once the new device will come on and stay on. \nIt should have a depth first requirement but that's not what the question asks for it says they must distribute across the available hosts .\n\nNote also it doesn't say by default 1 runs . They might run 3 as a minimum at all times . Or only turn a host off if it has no connections etc. Which would mean the running system would need a consistent downtime to reset itself."

The additional host can be put into drain mode (and off) until required and immediately available in the event a host is required in West US. \"Must be intiated manually\" is also met, as all an admin needs to do is turn on the VM. There is nothing suggesting that the East US region DC is unavailable, so the hostpool resource will still be usable. There is also no mention of minimizing administrative effort so, albeit this is an admin overhead, it meets all the requirements.
