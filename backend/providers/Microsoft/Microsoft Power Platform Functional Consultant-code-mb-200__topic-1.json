Don't forget that if you are a system admin in the target solution (and customers usually want to be admins) you still can do customizations of managed components in the target system using \"Settings-Customization\" area. You can decide which properties of the managed components can be changed! (To prove that open the managed solution and you will see following message &lt;&lt;You cannot directly edit the components within a managed solution. If the managed properties for solution components are set to allow customization, you can edit them in the Customizations area or from another unmanaged solution.&gt;&gt;)  So when you import an update of the managed solution in the target system, you have the option, like ceejaybee wrote, to mantain those customizations or to cancel them (the cancel option is the one I always choose because I agree with my customers that they don't have to play with the target system during the project phase :) ). So for me correct answer is UMMM"
