This approach simplifies maintenance, updates, and training while providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience for employees.\n\nOption C (one app for all employees of the team) might be easier to implement initially, but it may not address the unique needs and requirements of each job role as effectively as option A. By tailoring the app's features and layout to be role-specific, option A ensures that the solution meets the needs of both IT staff and managers while maintaining a manageable number of apps."
