    "answerDescription": "By default, tabular models use an in-memory cache to store and query data. When tabular models query data residing in-memory, even complex queries can be incredibly fast. However, there are some limitations to using cached data. Namely, large data sets can exceed available memory, and data freshness requirements can be difficult if not impossible to achieve on a regular processing schedule.<br>DirectQuery overcomes these limitations while also leveraging RDBMS features making query execution more efficient.<br>With DirectQuery: +<br>Data is up-to-date, and there is no extra management overhead of having to maintain a separate copy of the data (in the in-memory cache). Changes to the underlying source data can be immediately reflected in queries against the data model.<br>Datasets can be larger than the memory capacity of an Analysis Services server.<br>Etc.<br>References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/analysis-services/tabular-models/directquery-mode-ssas-tabular",

    "answerDescription": "A reference dimension relationship between a cube dimension and a measure group exists when the key column for the dimension is joined indirectly to the fact table through a key in another dimension table, as shown in the following illustration.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02204/0001600001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>A reference dimension relationship represents the relationship between dimension tables and a fact table in a snowflake schema design. When dimension tables are connected in a snowflake schema, you can define a single dimension using columns from multiple tables, or you can define separate dimensions based on the separate dimension tables and then define a link between them using the reference dimension relationship setting. The following figure shows one fact table named InternetSales, and two dimension tables called Customer and Geography, in a snowflake schema.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02204/0001600002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>You can create two dimensions related to the InternetSales measure group: a dimension based on the Customer table, and a dimension based on the Geography table. You can then relate the Geography dimension to the InternetSales measure group using a reference dimension relationship using the Customer dimension.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: A regular dimension relationship between a cube dimension and a measure group exists when the key column for the dimension is joined directly to the fact table.<br>C: Fact dimensions, frequently referred to as degenerate dimensions, are standard dimensions that are constructed from attribute columns in fact tables instead of from attribute columns in dimension tables.<br>E: Many to Many Dimension Relationships.<br>In most dimensions, each fact joins to one and only one dimension member, and a single dimension member can be associated with multiple facts. In relational database terminology, this is referred to as a one-to-many relationship. However, it is frequently useful to join a single fact to multiple dimension members. For example, a bank customer might have multiple accounts (checking, saving, credit card, and investment accounts), and an account can also have joint or multiple owners. The Customer dimension constructed from such relationships would then have multiple members that relate to a single account transaction.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02204/0001700001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>References: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/analysis-services/multidimensional-models-olap-logical-cube-objects/dimension-relationships",

In relational database terminology, this is referred to as a one-to-many relationship. However, it is frequently useful to join a single fact to multiple dimension members. For example, a bank customer might have multiple accounts (checking, saving, credit card, and investment accounts), and an account can also have joint or multiple owners. The Customer dimension constructed from such relationships would then have multiple members that relate to a single account transaction.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02204/0002000001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/analysis-services/multidimensional-models-olap-logical-cube-objects/dimension-relationships",

The company has a multidimensional Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services instance. The server has 80 gigabytes (GB) of available physical memory. The following installed services are running on the server:<br>\u2711 SQL Server Database Engine<br>\u2711 SQL Server Analysis Services (multidimensional)<br>The database engine instance has been configured for a hard cap of 50 GB, and it cannot be lowered. The instance contains the following cubes: SalesAnalysis,<br>OrderAnalysis.<br>Reports that are generated based on data from the OrderAnalysis cube take more time to complete when they are generated in the afternoon each day. You examine the server and observe that it is under significant memory pressure.<br>Processing for all cubes must occur automatically in increments. You create one job to process the cubes and another job to process the dimensions. You must configure a processing task for each job that optimizes performance. As the cubes grown in size, the overnight processing of the cubes often do not complete during the allowed maintenance time window.<br><br>SalesAnalysis -<br>The SalesAnalysis cube is currently being tested before being used in production. Users report that day name attribute values are sorted alphabetically. Day name attribute values must be sorted chronologically. Users report that they are unable to query the cube while any cube processing operations are in progress. You need to maximize data availability during cube processing and ensure that you process both dimensions and measures.<br><br>OrderAnalysis -<br>The OrderAnalysis cube is used for reporting and ad-hoc queries from Microsoft Excel. The data warehouse team adds a new table named Fact.Transaction to the cube. The Fact.Transaction table includes a column named Total Including Tax. You must add a new measure named Transactions  Total Including Tax to the cube. The measure must be calculated as the sum of the Total Including Tax column across any selected relevant dimensions.<br><br>Finance -<br>The Finance cube is used to analyze General Ledger entries for the company.<br><br>Requirements -<br>You must minimize the time that it takes to process cubes while meeting the following requirements:<br>\u2711 The Sales cube requires overnight processing of dimensions, cubes, measure groups, and partitions.<br>\u2711 The OrderAnalysis cube requires overnight processing of dimensions only.<br>\u2711 The Finance cube requires overnight processing of dimensions only.<br>You need to create the cube processing job and the dimension processing job.<br>Which processing task should you use for each job?

The databases require a total of 10 GB of disk space.<br>You also plan to deploy Cubes and Aggregations and use Object Processing. Cubes will have small fact tables and few dimension members. No unnecessary aggregations will be created. You plan to process an entire cube in a single transaction.<br><br>Data Models -<br>One of the data models is named CustomerSales. This data model contains eight tables. The model includes a table named Sales that defines several measures, including a measure named PriorYearSales. The PriorYearSales measure is referenced by other measures, and is not intended to be analyzed directly by users.<br>You must translate the metadata for all fata the CustomerSales data model to Simplifies Chinese. Team members from the Shanghai office assist with identifying appropriate translations.<br>A data model named OrderAnalysis is deployed to one of the SSAS instances. Order data is loaded into the OrderAnalysis data as part of an overnight process.<br>You observe that the model is not up-to-date.<br>The business analysis team uses a variety of client applications to issue MDX queries against OrderAnalysis. Order data must be completely up-to-date.<br>The OrderAnalysis model has two user-defined hierarchies that are defined in a table named Order. New customers are only added once per day. The overnight process is sufficiently up-to-date for the Customer data to provide optimal performance while achieving the data currency goals whenever possible.<br><br>Databases -<br>You deploy a database named DB1 to an SSAS instance as a project by using SQL Server Data Tools. Data analysts report that they cannot access near real time data from the SSAS SalesAnalysis model from DB1. You discover that the project has been deployed with the Direct Query Mode option set to OFF.<br>Most queries that use the SalesAnalysis data model use data from a table named FactInternetSales that is 20 gigabyte (GB) in size. Cached data must be available for the FactInternetSales table. All queries accessing the SalesAnalysis model must be executed in near real time.<br>A database named DB2 uses the InMemory query mode. Users frequently run the following query:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02204/0006900001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>You need to reconfigure the SSAS instance that hosts DB1.<br>Which three actions should perform in sequence?
