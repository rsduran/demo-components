        "content": "Agreed with the given answers.\n\nBox1: Self-hosted integration runtime\nWhy not Azure-SSIS integration rutime? SSIS is not mentioned, and the ETL tool in use is ADF. \nWhy not Azure integration runtime? On-premise SQL Server database is used.\n\nBox2: Schedule trigger \nWhy not event-based trigger? Schedule runs every 8 hours \nWhy not tumbling window schedule? There is no requirement for a tumbling window schedule. If the ETL jobs run close to 8 hours, a tumbling window schedule may be required. If jobs need to automatically re-run on failures, a tumbling window schedule may be required. Those requirements are not there. Schedule trigger fits for purpose.\n\nBox3: Copy activity\nNo need for explanation"

It would make less sense to use a thumbling window, not to mention that you can't even use \"day\" as the first argument (time interval) for the tumbling window function when coding, only hour as the biggest measurement unit"
