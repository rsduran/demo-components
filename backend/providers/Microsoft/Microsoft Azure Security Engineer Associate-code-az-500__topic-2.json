My reasons :\nIt says \"You have a hybrid configuration of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)\" which suggests that AD Connect is in place , but it isnt clear plus doesnt mention what configuration it has (Hash Synch, Pass through, Federated etc).\n\nCreating a site to site VPN will simply just enabled connectivty between the on premise network and the HDInsight cluster but not fulfil the authentifacation via on premises AD. \nSo without exact knowledge of the configuration of the Hybrid AD , any AD connect etc it is impossible to say for sure that would work. You could take it further and say it is impossible to know as you dont know the config of the HD cluster, any NSGs etc. I always find this ambiguous questions a bit annoying if I have the knowledge to answer them but the details are too blurry."

This allows users to sign in to Azure AD using their on-premises passwords. By enabling seamless single sign-on (SSO), users can access Azure AD-integrated resources without needing to re-enter their credentials.\n\nThis solution ensures that the password policies and user logon restrictions defined in the on-premises Active Directory apply to the synchronized user accounts in Azure AD. Additionally, it minimizes the infrastructure requirements as it does not require additional servers, such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), for federated identity."

By integrating Azure AD DS with your Azure HDInsight cluster on a virtual network, you can leverage these domain services to enable seamless authentication using on-premises Active Directory credentials. This setup allows users to access the HDInsight cluster with their existing credentials, facilitating a smoother and more secure integration between on-premises and cloud resources.\n\nThis approach is particularly effective in hybrid environments where organizations wish to extend their on-premises identity infrastructure to Azure services, ensuring that authentication and access control are centrally managed."

You can use access reviews to automate the discovery and subsequent approval or removal of privileged role assignments.\n2. Sign up PIM for Azure AD Roles: After discovering which privileged roles exist, the next step is to sign up for PIM. This involves configuring PIM settings for each role to establish the policies that govern their activation and use, like requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA), setting activation durations, and determining the need for approval from designated approvers.\n3. Consent to PIM: The final step involves giving consent to PIM. This step is about acknowledging and accepting the responsibility that comes with using PIM to manage and secure privileged access within your organization."

If you haven't set up MFA yet you are asked to complete MFA setup before you can consent PIM.\n\nReference: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/commit/755069f4ff7430f739b1933dc082dffe9b6d564f#diff-38273a45d682dbc4e8ca5cb8548a045af63218005855ec067b0707aaa9d406f0\n\nIn this case, User2 can enable Azure PIM.

Answer C (provide each application with a managed identity and configure storage1 to use Azure AD authentication) is the essential part of the solution to ensure that each application can securely authenticate itself and access data. However, answer D (giving each application an encryption key) is also an important part of the solution because encryption helps ensure that only the application that wrote the data can read it.\n\nTherefore, both answers C and D are complementary and together form a comprehensive solution to meet the requirements of the question. Microsoft's official answer seems to focus more on the managed identity part (answer C), but the community also highlights the importance of encryption (answer D), which is valid for ensuring data security."

I apologize for the oversight. The option to provide each app with a unique Base64-encoded AES-256 encryption key indeed aligns with the goal of ensuring that each app can read only the data it has written to storage1.
