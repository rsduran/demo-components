Azure provides various services that can be used to build web applications, and depending on the specific service you are using, AES-256 encryption can be implemented. For example, if you are using Azure App Service to host your web application, you can enable Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) for the underlying storage account. SSE automatically encrypts data at rest using AES-256 encryption. Additionally, you can also implement client-side encryption within your web application to further secure sensitive data before storing it in Azure. It's worth noting that encryption is a multi-layered approach, and while AES-256 is a strong encryption algorithm, it's important to consider other security measures such as access controls, network security, and secure coding practices to ensure a comprehensive security posture for your web application."

You can use Azure Policy to define and enforce resource locks for all resources within a specified scope. Resource locks can help prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical resources.\n\nUsing Azure Policy, you can define a policy that enforces resource locks for all resources within a subscription, resource group, or individual resource. The policy can be assigned to a management group, which will ensure that it is applied consistently across all development environments."
