If a region fails, the first two options are not helpful. \n\nGRS and RA-GRS both mean the third option. However, in GRS you would only be able to read from the fall back location once the disaster occured and first data source becomes unavailble. \n\nThe RA-GRS however, gives you a way to read from the 2nd location already which is useful in same cases but more expensive than simply GRS. \n\nHere, we do not have a requirement to read data from the 2nd location while the first is still actively working.

However there is no clear hint in the picture. Still I would answer \"Yes\" \n\n2. From VM1, traffic destined to the Azure file share will be routed to the internet. \n\n&gt; This won't be routed through the internet, as there is a service endpoint. This adds an additional route that will have a longer prefix and therefor directly route traffic to it. So answer is \"No\"\n\n3. From VM1, traffic destined to the Azure SQL database will be routed to the internet. \n\n&gt; I think we can assume SQL DB having a public IP (picture shows no private link). Now VM1 looks up it's local routing table, doesn't find a match and forwards it to it's default gateway. Now the UDR kicks in and forwards it to the NVA. From here on I'd say we can only guess.

    "answerDescription": "C: Forced tunneling lets you redirect or \"force\" all Internet-bound traffic back to your on-premises location via a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel for inspection and auditing.<br>This is a critical security requirement for most enterprise IT policies. Without forced tunneling, Internet-bound traffic from your VMs in Azure always traverses from<br>Azure network infrastructure directly out to the Internet, without the option to allow you to inspect or audit the traffic.<br>Forced tunneling in Azure is configured via virtual network user-defined routes.<br>D: ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider. With<br>ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365.<br>Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a co- location facility. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public Internet. This allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction",
