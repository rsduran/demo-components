Payment Terms with a value of 0D for Due Date Calculation\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the context of cash and carry sales, where customers pay for goods at the time of purchase, you would want to set up Payment Terms with a value of 0D for Due Date Calculation. This means that the payment is due immediately, which aligns with the nature of cash and carry transactions where payment is made at the point of sale.\n\nThe other options (A: Payment Service, B: Direct Debit Mandate with a value of OneOff for Type of Payment, C: Payment Method with a value of Bank Account for Balance Account) are not typically used for configuring cash and carry sales in Dynamics 365 Business Central."

By nature a deposit slip is a small paper form that a bank customer includes when depositing funds into a bank account. A deposit slip, by definition, contains the date, the name of the depositor, the depositor's account number, and the amounts being deposited."
