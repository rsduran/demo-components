    "answerDescription": "Scenario: You plan to use a 30-second period to calculate the average temperature reading of the sensors.<br>Tumbling window functions are used to segment a data stream into distinct time segments and perform a function against them, such as the example below. The key differentiators of a Tumbling window are that they repeat, do not overlap, and an event cannot belong to more than one tumbling window.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: Hopping window functions hop forward in time by a fixed period. It may be easy to think of them as Tumbling windows that can overlap, so events can belong to more than one Hopping window result set.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-window-functions",
