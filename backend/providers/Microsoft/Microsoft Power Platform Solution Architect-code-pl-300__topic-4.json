According to Microsoft\u2019s documentation12, Build permission allows a user to create new content based on a dataset, such as reports, dashboards, and other items. However, the ability to grant permissions to others is associated with the Reshare permission2. This permission allows a user to grant access to the semantic model to others2. Therefore, unless a user also has Reshare permission, they cannot grant Build permissions to others. Please note that this is a simplified explanation and actual Power BI permissions may involve more variables and complexities. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"
