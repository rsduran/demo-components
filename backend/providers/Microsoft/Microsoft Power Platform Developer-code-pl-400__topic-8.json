Answer is correct.\nStarting with Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.0, if your JavaScript web resource depends on an entity attribute value that you don\u2019t want to display in the form, you can set the attribute as a dependency for the JavaScript web resource. This means that the attribute will be available within the client API attributes collection so you can get or set the value in your code. When you add a dependency this way, the controls collection of the attribute will be empty because there will be no control on the form.\n\nBefore this feature you would need to manually add the attribute to the form and then configure the control to be hidden. Now you can establish this dependency more directly and eliminate the possibility that someone will remove the hidden field from the form."

This should be checked as early as possible in the event pipeline to prevent unnecessary processing.\nThe application is reviewed and approved - PostOperation\n\nYou want to store the name of the HR team member that approves an application. This should be done after the main operation has been executed, which is likely updating the application record with the approval information.\nThe ID card is printed - PostOperation\n\nAfter the application has been reviewed and approved, the ID card printing should occur as part of the final step. This should also be done as a PostOperation to ensure that the ID card is only printed if the application has been successfully reviewed and approved.\nSo, the correct order is:\n\nPreValidation: Mandatory drug screening is complete\nPostOperation: The application is reviewed and approved\nPostOperation: The ID card is printed"

    "answerDescription": "Step 1: Add another step to the business process flow.<br>Configure custom controls on a related entity form<br>In this version of the preview, the easiest way to add custom controls to a BPF is to begin by adding them to a form of the entity that the BPF stage is defined on.<br>In our example, the Budget Amount and Decision Maker steps of the Qualify stage are defined on the Lead entity. We begin by adding these fields to the Lead main form, and then configure the radial knob and flip switch custom controls for them.<br>Step 2: Open the business process in the Business Process Flow designer and select Activate/Update.<br>Generate and export the BPF form<br>To generate the form for a business process you want to add custom controls to, open the business process in the BPF designer and click on Activate/Update.<br>Step 3: Copy custom control configurations to the business process flow FormXML for the related entity form.<br>Copy custom control configurations to the BPF FormXML<br>To add custom controls to the BPF, we begin by copying the custom control configurations from the Lead entity form that we just exported. To do this, we begin by viewing the FormXML for the Lead entity form, which can be found in the 'customizations' file in the solution zip file.<br>Step 4: Import the solution into Dataverse.<br>Import customizations into the CDS (aka Dataverse) environment<br>Now that we're done making our changes, save the customizations.xml document and add it to the managed solution zip file containing the BPF, replacing the file within it.<br>Next, import these changes into your CDS environment by going to the Solutions tab in the PowerApps portal and click 'Import'.<br>Reference:<br>https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Power-Automate-Community-Blog/Preview-Custom-Controls-in-Business-Process-Flows/ba-p/263237",
