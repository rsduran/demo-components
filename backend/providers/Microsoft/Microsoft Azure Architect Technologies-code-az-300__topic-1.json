Before you can modify access, you need to create a service principle to manage that access for.  The correct answer is indeed 'D' - you need to set this up with a Managed Service Identity first.\n\nHow a system-assigned managed identity works with an Azure VM:\n\n1. Azure Resource Manager receives a request to enable the system-assigned managed identity on a VM.\n\n2. Azure Resource Manager creates a service principal in Azure AD for the identity of the VM. The service principal is created in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription.\n\n3. Azure Resource Manager configures the identity on the VM by updating the Azure Instance Metadata Service identity endpoint with the service principal client ID and certificate.\n\n4. After the VM has an identity, use the service principal information to grant the VM access to Azure resources. To call Azure Resource Manager, use role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure AD to assign the appropriate role to the VM service principal. To call Key Vault, grant your code access to the specific secret or key in Key Vault."

On the Virtual network gateway page, click Create at the bottom of the page to open the Create virtual network gateway page.<br>Step 2: On the Create virtual network gateway page, fill in the values for your virtual network gateway.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02758/0012700001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02758/0012800001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Name: Name your gateway. This is not the same as naming a gateway subnet. It's the name of the gateway object you are creating.<br>Gateway type: Select VPN. VPN gateways use the virtual network gateway type VPN.<br>Virtual network: Choose the virtual network to which you want to add this gateway. Click Virtual network to open the 'Choose a virtual network' page. Select the<br>VNet. If you don't see your VNet, make sure the Location field is pointing to the region in which your virtual network is located.<br>Gateway subnet address range: You will only see this setting if you did not previously create a gateway subnet for your virtual network. If you previously created a valid gateway subnet, this setting will not appear.<br>Step 4: Select Create New to create a Gateway subnet.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02758/0012900001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Step 5: Click Create to begin creating the VPN gateway. The settings are validated and you'll see the \"Deploying Virtual network gateway\" tile on the dashboard.<br>Creating a gateway can take up to 45 minutes.

If gateway subnets doesn't exist in the VNETs, you have to go and create those first before creating Virtual network gateways. After half hour or hour, come back once the VNG are created, then add connections by going to the VNG and through keys. This options is very unlikely and not realistic, in my opinion."

Since, the VNet 1 can't communicate directly with the VNet3 and similarly the VNet3 can't communicate with the VNet1 directly, they have to communicate via VNet2 (HUB and Spoke model), therefore Gateway Transit must be implemented on VNet2 and on VNet1 and VNet3 we need to use Remote Gateways. According to my understanding the options A and D is wrong because we enable the forwarding traffic in case of DNS. Similarly, we use user defined routes using Route Table in case of DNS. For example, If the VNet2 was configured as DNS Server then in that case we will implement forwarding traffic and define custom routes on VNet2.  \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-point-to-site-routing#multis2sbgp"

For most scenarios, it is more economical and secure to associate a public IP address to a load balancer or to an individual virtual machine (aka a jumpbox), which then routes incoming connections to scale set virtual machines as needed (for example, through inbound NAT rules).\n\nHowever, some scenarios do require scale set virtual machines to have their own public IP addresses. An example is gaming, where a console needs to make a direct connection to a cloud virtual machine, which is doing game physics processing.
