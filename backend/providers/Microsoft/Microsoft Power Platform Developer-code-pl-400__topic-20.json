This control allows the user to scan a barcode using the device's camera and capture the data encoded in it.\n\nTo use the Barcode scanner control in a canvas app, you would add the control to the screen and configure it to capture the type of barcode you want to scan. You can also customize the control's appearance and behavior to fit your specific requirements.\n\nOnce the barcode is scanned, you can use the captured data to perform various operations in your app, such as updating inventory counts, looking up product information, or processing a sales transaction."
