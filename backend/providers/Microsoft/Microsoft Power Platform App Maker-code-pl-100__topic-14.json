In fact, you might also need Power BI desktop to setup the whole thing (can't confirm this, but below tutorial appears to suggest that).\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-sql-tutorial\n\nTo setup a connection with Dataverse and be able to create the visualizations you also have to use Power BI desktop initially. You can use Power BI service after publication but I don't see how it can be used by itself to do this."
