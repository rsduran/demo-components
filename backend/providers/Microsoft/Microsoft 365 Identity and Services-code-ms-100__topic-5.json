Go to https://config.office.com and create a new XML configuration file that suites your needs. After that you save the file (i.e., download it locally)\n\nThe second step is to use the ODT to download the Office packages as stated in your XML configuration file by running SETUP.EXE /DOWNLOAD Name_Of_XML.XML. This will download the exact Office version with the parameters you created in step 1. After some time, the folder will contain the Office installation files ready to setup\n\nThe question states: \"You need to prepare the environment to ensure that all Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installations occur from a network share\", and this is done by copying the entire folder on a network share, and then running SETUP.EXE /CONFIG Name_Of_XML.XML, this will install Office from your network share and not from other sources"

In this case it'll be on a local share. \n\n2.

However, After 1 yr, the file will be deleted and retained in the recoverable location where it is not accessible by Users.\nY - The File has up to 4 retention years and admins have access to the recoverable folder, allowing them to restore till Jan 1st, 2022.\nY - Retention is designed to hold for 4 years, however, the \"...delete after this time..\" radio button is set to false. So files will remain in the recoverable path.\n\nExplanation for Third Answer:\nIf the retention policy expires and the \"Do you want to delete after this time?\" option is set to \"No\", the expired items will not be automatically deleted. Instead, they will remain in the recoverable location, and the organization's administrators or users (with appropriate permissions) can manually delete, recover, or take other actions on the items as needed."

However, users with appropriate permissions can access the site collection Recycle Bin to recover deleted items. The Preservation Hold library, on the other hand, is typically accessible only by administrators and not by regular users.\n\nIn summary, while users may not have direct access to items in recoverable locations, they can often recover these items through specific features or with the assistance of an administrator."
