    "answer": "BE",
    "answerDescription": "B: Incremental Sync: the first parameter to the pull operation is a query name that is used only on the client. If you use a non-null query name, the Azure Mobile<br>SDK performs an incremental sync. Each time a pull operation returns a set of results, the latest updatedAt timestamp from that result set is stored in the SDK local system tables. Subsequent pull operations retrieve only records after that timestamp.<br>E (not D): To use incremental sync, your server must return meaningful updatedAt values and must also support sorting by this field. However, since the SDK adds its own sort on the updatedAt field, you cannot use a pull query that has its own orderBy clause.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-offline-data-sync",
