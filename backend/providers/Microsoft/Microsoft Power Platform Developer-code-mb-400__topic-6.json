    "answerDescription": "The event pipeline allows you to configure when in the event the plug-in code will execute. The event pipeline is divided into the following events and stages:<br><br>Box 1: PreValidation -<br><br>Pre-event/Pre-Validation -<br>This stage executes before anything else, even before basic validation if the triggering action is even allowed based on security. Therefore, it would be possible to trigger the plug-in code even without actually having permission to do so and great consideration must be used when writing a pre-validation plug-in.  Also, execution in this stage might not be part of the database transaction.<br>Examples:- security checks being performed to verify the calling or logged on user has the correct permissions to perform the intended operation.<br><br>Box 2: PreOperation -<br><br>Pre-event/Pre-Operation -<br>This stage executes after validation, but before the changes has been committed to database. This is one of the most commonly used stages.<br>Example uses:<br>If and \"update\" plug-in should update the same record, it is best practice to use the pre-operation stage and modify the properties. That way the plug-in update is done within same DB transaction without needing additional web service update call.<br><br>Box 3: PostOperation -<br>Plug-ins which are to execute after the main operation. Plug-ins registered in this stage are executed within the database transaction.<br>This stage executed after changes have been committed to database. This is one of the most used stages.<br>Example uses:<br>Most of the \"Create\" plugins are post-event. This allows access to the created GUID and creation of relationships to newly created record.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>MainOperation:- main operation of the system, such as create, update, delete, and so on. No custom plug-ins can be registered in this stage.<br>Reference:<br>https://community.dynamics.com/crm/f/microsoft-dynamics-crm-forum/216569/ms-crm-plugin-execution-pipeline",
