Because my god is this a poorly written question.\n\nIn D365 as of today (7/8/22) there is no \"offset:\" there is a ledger accrual start date. There is no \"debit\" or \"credit\" accrual scheme: there is an \"accrual account\" option with either \"account\" or \"offset account.\"\n\nFurther, it doesn't even explain what our journal entry is. There doesn't seem to be many accountants in the comments, but typically you would be debiting an expense account while crediting a liability account. (Then when paid, debit the liability against cash.)\n\nSo that being said, the setup makes no sense because none of the terms actually align with D365. The answers make no sense for the same reason, but also additionally there is no specifying of what is being accrued, the liability the expense, both or neither."

By the time the 'new Fiscal Year' starts, and the 1st payment is paid to the life insurance, any new employees will become current employees. So, to prepare employees for the 1st insurance payment, any money collected at the start of the new Fiscal Year is a credit since the 1st payment has not yet posted. That is why B is correct.\nConfiguring the calendar for Debit accrual to begin at the 1st day of the new Fiscal Year ensures that the 2nd insurance payment is prepared and recorded properly. \nThe 1st day of the new fiscal year has not yet begun so credit to employee's 1st pay date until the Fiscal year does begin, and then once the Fiscal year begins, start the Debit accrual to properly record.\n\nThis is why I agree with the answer B&amp;D."

The 4-4-5 configuration means that each quarter is divided into three periods: the first two periods are 4 weeks long, and the third period is 5 weeks long.\n\nThe correct approach involves setting up the fiscal year with 13 periods, each representing one of these weeks-based periods.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Set up the length of the period to 13 months.\n\nHere's why:\n\nSet up the length of the period to 13 months: In a 4-4-5 accounting calendar, each fiscal year is divided into 13 periods. This setup allows you to structure your financial periods to reflect the 4-4-5 weeks within each quarter. Each period would correspond to either a 4-week or a 5-week interval, ensuring accurate reporting and period closure based on the 4-4-5 structure."

This ensures that when sales tax is settled and posted, it is transferred to the correct main account.\nA. Create a sales tax settlement period for each state: While setting up settlement periods is necessary, it does not handle the association with the main accounts directly.\nB. Select a vendor account during the sales tax group setup: This step is not related to configuring main accounts for posting sales tax liabilities.\nC. Create a sales tax ledger posting group for each state: While this can be part of the setup, it is not sufficient by itself.
