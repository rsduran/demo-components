Automated backup v2 uses storage account not recovery service vault so, this is the right answer for this specific question / scenario.

To manually rotate the keys, the following process must be followed:\n\nAlter service connections to use the secondary key.\n\nRotate the primary key in the Azure portal or on the command line. For example, to rotate key1 for the az303fsdemosa storage account in PowerShell, execute the following commands:\n\nClick here to view code image\n\nNew-AzStorageAccountKey '\n  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName '\n  -Name $storageAccountName '\n  -KeyName key1\nAlter service connections to use the primary key again.\n\nRotate the secondary key using the same method as shown in step2.\n\nThe switch between primary and secondary in this process is why Microsoft recommends that only the primary or secondary keys are used by all services by default. Otherwise, connections to storage accounts will be lost when you rotate the keys."

Because Azure contains resilient copies of your data, your local server becomes a disposable caching device, and recovering from a failed server can be done by adding a new server to your Azure File Sync deployment. Rather than restoring from a local backup, you provision another Windows Server, install the Azure File Sync agent on it, and then add it to your Azure File Sync deployment. Azure File Sync downloads your file namespace before downloading data, so that your server can be up and running as soon as possible. For even faster recovery, you can have a warm stand by server as part of your deployment, or you can use Azure File Sync with Windows Clustering.\n\nAnswer is Yes"
