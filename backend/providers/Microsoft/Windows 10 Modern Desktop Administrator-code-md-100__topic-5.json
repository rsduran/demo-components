The task is to ensure that Windows FEATURE (not quality) updates on Client1 are deferred (not paused) for 15 days WHEN the updates become generally AVAILABLE. If you use the Settings app it will simply pause from today, not from when the updates become available. But I didn' find the policy that Perycles mentioned in his reply.

If a critical problem occurs after installing a system update, device driver, application, or after modifying system settings incorrectly using the Registry or another tool, you can use one of the available restore points to revert the computer to an earlier point in time to resolve the problem without losing your files.\nAlthough this is a handy recovery tool, for some odd reason, System Restore comes disabled by default, which means that you must enable it before Windows 10 can create restore points automatically or you manually.\nOption B \u2013 NO as its to remove .cab package from image and not the .msu updates from OS."

Essentially, when any change is made to a file or folder on your hard disk, the change journal is updated with a description of the change and the name of the file or folder. So to determine which files need to be backed up, File History simply consults the NTFS change journal.

By working with these prerelease builds, insiders can share feedback with the company to help it fix bugs and smooth over the rough spots before an update hits the general public.<br>In the current model, Microsoft offers three rings: Fast, Slow, and Release Preview. The Fast ring is for Windows Insiders who want updates the fastest and are willing to put up with more bugs and glitches. The Slow ring is for those who'd rather wait for more stable updates. The Preview Release ring is the most stable of the three and is geared toward people who want to get an upcoming major Windows update before it's released to the public.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-microsoft-is-changing-its-windows-insider-program",

This cmdlet is specifically designed for querying Group Policy Objects in a Windows environment and provides detailed information about each policy, including those that have been applied to Microsoft Edge.\nOn the other hand, the \"gpresult\" command with the \"/H\" parameter is a general-purpose command that provides information about the policies applied to a computer, but it may not provide as much detail as the Get-GPO cmdlet. Additionally, \"gpresult\" is an older tool that is not specifically designed for querying GPOs in a Windows environment, and its functionality is limited compared to the newer \"Get-GPO\" cmdlet.\nIn conclusion, if you need to generate a report that contains all the Microsoft Edge policy settings applied to a computer, it is recommended to use the \"Get-GPO\" cmdlet from PowerShell for more accurate and detailed results."

Quick Assist allows you to remotely view services, performance counters, registry settings, and event logs, making it a great choice for your scenario.\nWhile Intune does offer remote management capabilities for devices enrolled in its management platform, it is not specifically designed for the use case of remote assistance and troubleshooting.
