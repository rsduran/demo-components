When an attacker is eavesdropping on your communications, it is referred to as sniffing or snooping. The ability of an eavesdropper to monitor the network is generally the biggest security problem that administrators face in an enterprise. Without strong encryption services that are based on cryptography, your data can be read by others as it traverses the network."

If any of the accounts have passwords that have alt characters in them before you upgrade, you probably want to change those passwords. The new log in screen does not allow the alt and number pad to generate those characters anymore. My brother suggested using an open source program to modify the password file. I did not think about that and reset the password with another account on the system. Changing the group policy to the classic login did not convert the login screen for the system. When you reset the password with another account, all remembered passwords are lost for that account. Also, any encrypted files are inaccessible.\n\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/alt-characters-are-not-allowed-in-passwords/579a86e9-a660-41fe-b74f-a48591337f5d"

This event category is applicable to domain controllers only since DCs are used to validate accounts in domains.<br>\u2711 Audit account management - audit each event of account management on a computer. Examples of account maintenance include password changes, user account and group modifications.<br>\u2711 Audit directory service access - audit the event of a user accessing an Active Directory object that has its own system access control list (SACL) specified.<br>\u2711 Audit logon events - audit each instance of a user logging on to or logging off from a computer. Note that this is different than the Audit account login events category. This tracks the logon event to a specific server. The former tracks which domain controller authenticated the user.<br>\u2711 Audit object access - audit the event of a user accessing an object that has its own system access control list (SACL) specified. Examples of objects are files, folders, registry keys, printers, etc.<br>\u2711 Audit policy change - audit every incident of a change to user rights assignment policies, audit policies, or trust policies.<br>\u2711 Audit privilege use - audit each instance of a user exercising a user right.<br>\u2711 Audit process tracking - audit detailed tracking information for events such as program activation, process exit, handle duplication, and indirect object access.<br>\u2711 Audit system events - audit when a user restarts or shuts down the computer or when an event occurs that affects either the system security or the security log.<br>Reference: http://www.petri.co.il/windows_auditing.htm",

Dictionary attacks are rarely successful against systems that employ multiple-word phrases, and unsuccessful against systems that employ random combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters mixed up with numerals.<br>Reference:<br>http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/dictionary-attack",

The card connects to a reader with direct physical contact or with a remote contactless radio frequency interface. With an embedded microcontroller, smart cards have the unique ability to store large amounts of data, carry out their own on-card functions (e.g., encryption and mutual authentication) and interact intelligently with a smart card reader. Smart card technology conforms to international standards (ISO/IEC 7816 and ISO/IEC 14443) and is available in a variety of form factors, including plastic cards, key fobs, watches, subscriber identification modules used in GSM mobile phones, and USB-based tokens."

This is a method in cryptography that prevents two systems from using the same key, even though they may share the same password. Without salting, a pair of machines using the same password, even coincidentally, end up with the same key. This is a vulnerability for rainbow tables, which are huge spreadsheets that allow you to look up the original password (provided you know the key). Salting largely nullifies the use of rainbow tables, because every password uses a random value to generate a different key. It also effectively renders password derivation a one-way function, because you can't backwards-generate passwords from keys. For example, SSIDs are used to salt WPA passwords. So, even if your neighbor uses the same password, he's going to have a different key if his router has a different name.\n\nReference: https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wireless-security-hack,2981-5.html"

An Active Directory trust (AD trust) is a method of connecting two distinct Active Directory domains (or forests) to allow users in one domain to authenticate against resources in the other. ...

This domain trusts another domain to authenticate users for them. The trusted domain. This domain authenticates users on behalf of (in trust for) another domain.\n\nBased on how the question makes no inference to anything discussed here, I say FIrewall."
