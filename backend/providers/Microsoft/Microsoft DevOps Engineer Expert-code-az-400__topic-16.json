That could be a repo set to \"private\" visibility on GitHub.com or one on a private network via GitHub Enterprise Server.  The GitHub importer tool imports to GitHub.com only.\n\nThe case study talks about the central office being in the UK, but it doesnt talk about how this data was stored prior.  Was it on prem?  The case study doesnt specify, but its kind of important.  If you want to infer that the central UK office housed the repo servers prior, then GitHub Importer wouldnt work unless the code was given a public address, so you'd choose git-tfs.  But since it didnt specify, you might want to keep it simple, and assume its publicly available because it doesnt say otherwise, in which case, GitHub Importer would work"
