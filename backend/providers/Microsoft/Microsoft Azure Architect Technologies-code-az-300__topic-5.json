I tested the way to customize the time of thresholds and change default values too: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/autoscale-understanding-settings\n\nBesides that:\nINFO(Duration in minutes): This is amount of time that Autoscale engine will look back for metrics. For example, 10 minutes means that every time autoscale runs, it will query metrics for the past 10 minutes. This allows your metrics to stabilize and avoids reacting to transient spikes. The Storage queue Approximate Message Count and Service Bus Message Count metrics are special in that these metrics are point in time only and have no history. For these metrics, the duration field will be ignored by the Autoscale engine."

Answer C mentions scaling up by 1.
