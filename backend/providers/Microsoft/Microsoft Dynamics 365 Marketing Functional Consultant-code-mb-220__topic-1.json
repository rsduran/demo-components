The message and template aren't linked, so when you edit the message, the template won't change; likewise, any future changes that you make to a template won't affect any existing messages that were created by using it.\"\nThis means that change the templates it's not enough because the existing emails won't be changed."

Scoring fails for leads that don't have a contact associated with them. Also, segments in Dynamics 365 Marketing can only include contacts, not leads, which means that you can only address marketing emails to contacts.\n\nYour landing pages will typically either create a lead/contact pair when you create a new contact, or associate new leads with existing contacts when they're available. But when you create a lead manually, as you did here, you must also associate it with a contact manually to enable lead scoring.\""
