    "answerDescription": "HDInsight HBase is offered as a managed cluster that is integrated into the Azure environment. The clusters are configured to store data directly in Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Store, which provides low latency and increased elasticity in performance and cost choices. This enables customers to build interactive websites that work with large datasets, to build services that store sensor and telemetry data from millions of end points, and to analyze this data with Hadoop jobs. HBase and Hadoop are good starting points for big data project in Azure; in particular, they can enable real-time applications to work with large datasets.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hbase-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-introduction",
