This is why both Dynamics 365 Finance workflow (which can trigger a Business Event) and Power Automate (which can listen for the Business Event and post a message to Teams) are needed for this scenario23."

    "answerDescription": "Toolkit Overview: RSAT Integration Testing<br>RSAT (regression suite automation tool) will get a new improvement where our RSAT tool should be able to support an end-to-end integration scenario. It will allow run sessions for third-party applications that run before or after Finance and Supply Chain Management is run. Essentially, you will be able to trigger an integration in some portal and then verify the outcomes in Finance and Supply Chain Management. It's the same as if you were doing with the C# NUnit framework and selenium WebDrivers, although, in this case, you likely won't require coding. The main idea is to be able to do integration scenario testing and be able to do that without developer help. Since development can be expensive it's not something that customers really aim to do. We will get this feature in general availability and in public preview within the next few months, so stay tuned and follow the latest Microsoft improvements so you don't miss out!<br>Reference:<br>https://companial.com/blog/how-to-automate-integration-testing-in-microsoft-dynamics-365-fscm/",

The central distribution center, accounting and customer service center are located in the company's headquarters building in the state of Colorado. The company also has an additional warehouse in the state of New York. The company is known for its customer-friendly policies.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tAlpine Ski House currently has an outdated accounting system that is not connected to the New York warehouse.<br>\u2022\tThe warehouse system contains inventory quantities, but does not have costing, therefore the FIFO principles are applied through spreadsheet calculations at month end.<br>\u2022\tAlpine Ski House has worked to create a future state roadmap as a foundation for growth. They have decided to implement Dynamics 365 cloud applications and must limit the amount of on premises hardware as they are not staffed for support. They are expecting to implement required devices for warehouse applications to support WMS only.<br>\u2022\tThe customer service center places phone orders on behalf of wholesalers and retailers.<br>\u2022\tThe customer service team provides concierge services to the top 20 largest customers. Each customer service team member is assigned to 5 customers as the customer's dedicated customer service representative.<br>\u2022\tThe call center has a phone system that records calls and stores the call duration.<br>\u2022\tData is a combination of systems that are disconnected to include warehouse and accounting. Customer records and consumer records are stored in the call center third-party system. Excel spreadsheets are used for consolidated reporting from these systems.<br>\u2022\tAlpine Ski House must enable business partners to place their own B2B orders on the web as well as manage their own users.<br>\u2022\tThe company has decided to expand distribution to Banff, Alberta and create a new operating legal entity in Canada. This expansion must be planned for as part of the solution, as it will be up and running six months after the initial US company is operating on the new applications.<br><br><br>Requirements<br> -<br><br><br>Applications and environment<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tRequired applications must align to the future state roadmap.<br>\u2022\tBusiness partners must have the ability to onboard their own users for placing orders on the web.<br>\u2022\tThe Canadian company must use the same base data as the US operating company and must be set up in the same instance.<br>\u2022\tSales order history data must not be imported. All current and future orders must be migrated to the new system.<br>\u2022\tMaster data for customers must be migrated from both the call center third-party system as well as the accounting system. You identify the following requirements:<br> o\tThe mapping fields for customer records in both systems are the same, except the accounting system which has three additional fields that must be mapped.<br> o\tDuplicate records must not be imported.<br>\u2022\tCutover plan<br>o\tUser1 reports that sales orders will be open and not shipped at the time of cutover to production. There are 20 orders expected to be open.<br><br><br>Customer service<br> -<br><br><br>General <br> -<br><br>\u2022\tConcierge customer service reps must be able to access customer records for all customers in their customer group.<br>\u2022\tCustomer service reps must be able organize how information is presented when they sign into the new system.<br>\u2022\tSecurity must be applied to the customer service reps as a group and must not be applied at the individual level.<br><br><br>Return policies<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tSporting equipment is warranted by the manufacturer and must not be returned to Alpine Ski House warehouse. Alpine Ski House does not strictly enforce this policy. Exceptions to the policy are allowed with manager approval.<br>\u2022\tCustomer service must track reported issues with sporting equipment to identify trends.<br>\u2022\tCustomers can exchange apparel, but refunds must not be permitted. Any consumer exchanges must occur directly through Alpine's call center and cannot be returned to a physical store.<br><br><br>Exchange policies<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tAll consumer calls must be logged for tracking purposes. The customer service representative will determine if there is an exchange, or if the consumer should be redirected to the manufacturer. Digital content is final sale only. All complaints must still be tracked.<br>\u2022\tReturns and replacement orders must be processed through the warehouse. Consumer information for returns and replacement orders does not need to be stored.<br>\u2022\tA record of the location where the consumer purchased the product must be stored for tracking purpose <br>\u2022\tThe customer service reps must be able to view the order status for delayed shipments or orders that have been shipped but not invoiced. They need to have shortcuts to view this information.<br>\u2022\tReturns or credits for a concierge customer that are not from a consumer do not require notifications to the concierge representative.<br>\u2022\tWeb orders must be limited to B2B, and consumers web access must not be required for order placement.<br>\u2022\tThe call center must track the call minutes in the phone system by customer number.<br>\u2022\tThe system must send the following notifications:<br>o\tDedicated concierge representative must be automatically notified when an exchanged product has shipped. The concierge representative must set up the alert.<br> o\tExternal customers must be notified of the new consumer exchanges. The notification must integrate into the customer's third party dashboard and must not be sent as an email notification.<br><br><br>Customer Service<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tThe customer service center is overloaded with frequently asked questions (FAQ's) that are consuming resources and creating issues with customer service levels.<br>\u2022\tAlpine Ski House has decided to deploy an automated FAQ website because they do not have sufficient staff resources to manage customer interactions. All automated interactions must be stored for 30 days.<br>\u2022\tThe company has decided to extend its concierge program to the top 25 customers. A new representative has been hired and requires the same screen layout as other team members.<br>\u2022\tWhen new customers are created in the system, the customer number must automatically pass to the call center phone system.<br><br><br>Implementation<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tThe implementation is expected to take 12 months. Alpine Ski House wants to ensure that when they go live, they are on the most current available update of Dynamics 365. Testing must occur in the various stages of the implementation. You identify the following testing requirements:<br> o\tPlatform updates will be applied, and business processes will be verified to perform as expected, either manual or automated where possible against stored task recordings.<br> o\tDevelopment must be completed by the 10th month. Developers must perform initial testing code that they create.<br> o\tWhen development is completed, all processes in the system must be tested by the user group.<br>\u2022\tDue to competing demands for the project team, the company wants to automate as much of the testing as possible.<br>\u2022\tThe project manager is concerned that a critical field must have validation scripts run against it during automated testing. The developers will be required to write the custom validation scrip. The user creating the test script must document the step in the test script that the specific validation script must be run for the developers.<br>\u2022\tThe project manager wants to put a control in place to ensure that once the automated testing is established the test scripts are not modified or overwritten.<br><br><br>You need to determine the testing types required for implementation activities.<br><br>Which testing type should you use?
