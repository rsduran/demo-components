In both you cannot set the GUID of a record with the Dataverse connector, which is needed here. You could trigger a dataflow, but nothing suggests, that such a setup is in place.\nWith the CMT and Import Wizard you can import data and set the GUID of records.\nAzure Data Factory does not seem to fit, because it is a big data integration tool.

It's the foundational step before setting up specific ALM processes.\n\nInstall the Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools: These tools are necessary for automating the build and deployment process of Power Platform solutions. They include tasks like exporting a solution from an environment, checking it into source control, and deploying solutions to target environments.\n\nCreate an Export pipeline: Before you can release a solution, you need to have it exported from the development environment. The export pipeline facilitates the automation of extracting the solution from the Power Platform environment so that it can be stored in source control.\n\nRun the pipeline\n\nSo: 6,5,3,2"
