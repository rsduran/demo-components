It works only if ONE specific web app is very consuming or you need high availability.\nCosts minimized : Here is the confusion. Nowhere it's written that all 10 web app must be in the same app service plan. You can have 10 app services for 10 web apps, or 2 app services fo 5 web apps each (standard). However I belive the question assumes 1 app service plan per web app, which one to choose ? This is why basic is preferred."

As a cloud computing service, Azure provides customers with the ability to consume computing resources on a pay-per-use basis, which is typically classified as an operating expense (OpEx) rather than a capital expense (CapEx).\n\nCustomers can use Azure to access a wide range of computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, without the need to purchase and maintain their own hardware. This pay-as-you-go model allows customers to scale up or down their usage of computing resources based on their business needs, and pay only for what they use, similar to a utility bill.\n\nWhile Azure may not provide CapEx in the traditional sense, it does allow customers to potentially reduce their CapEx by reducing the need to purchase and maintain their own hardware. Additionally, Azure offers some purchasing options, such as reserved instances, which can provide cost savings for customers who commit to using specific computing resources for a set period of time."

Azure charges for the usage of resources such as virtual machines, storage, and data transfer. Therefore, you need to plan to pay monthly usage costs for hosting the website on Azure. Deploying a VPN, paying to transfer all the website data to Azure, or reducing the number of connections to the website are not necessarily required for migrating a public website to Azure."

You could start with a public cloud and then combine that with an on-premise infrastructure to implement a hybrid cloud.<br><br>Box 2: Yes -<br>A company can extend the capacity of its internal network by using the public cloud.  This is very common.  When you need more capacity, rather than pay out for new on-premises infrastructure, you can configure a cloud environment and connect your on-premises network to the cloud environment by using a VPN.<br><br>Box 3: No -<br>It is not true that only guest users can access cloud resources.  You can give anyone with an account in Azure Active Directory access to the cloud resources.<br>There are many authentication scenarios but a common one is to replicate your on-premises Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory and provide access to the Azure Active Directory accounts.  Another commonly used authentication method is 'Federation' where authentication for access to cloud resources is passed to another authentication provider such as an on-premises Active Directory. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/",

To implement a hybrid cloud model, a company typically needs to have an internal network that connects its on-premises resources (like servers and data centers) with the public cloud. This internal network, often referred to as a private cloud, is essential for integrating with public cloud services to create a seamless hybrid environment. The internal network allows for secure communication, data transfer, and management between on-premises infrastructure and public cloud resources."

They can start with a public cloud and combine it with an on-premise infrastructure.\n\n**Box 2**: Yes, a company can indeed extend the computing resources of its internal network by using the public cloud. This is a common practice known as cloud bursting.\n\n**Box 3**: No, it's not true that only guest users can access cloud resources. Anyone with an account in Azure Active Directory can be given access. There are various authentication methods available, including replicating on-premises Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory and using 'Federation' where authentication for access to cloud resources is passed to another authentication provider such as an on-premises Active Directory."

It does not necessarily need to have an existing INTERNAL NETWORK in place. The private cloud offers dedicated resource specifically for an organization; while the public cloud offers a shared resource environment.\n\nScenario 2 and 3 are not in contention.

Pricing tiers for PaaS services like Azure App Service primarily affect the CPU, storage, and other resource allocations, but not the memory.\n\nTo adjust the memory allocated to an Azure PaaS service, you typically need to choose a different service plan or instance size within the same pricing tier. Azure App Service plans, for example, come in various sizes, each with a specific combination of CPU, memory, and other resources. By selecting a different service plan or instance size, you can increase or decrease the memory available to your application.\n\nSo, while changing the pricing tier can affect the overall performance and resource allocation for a PaaS solution, including CPU and storage, adjusting the memory allocation typically involves selecting the right App Service Plan or instance size within the chosen tier."

Pricing tiers for PaaS services like Azure App Service primarily affect the CPU, storage, and other resource allocations, but not the memory.\n\nTo adjust the memory allocated to an Azure PaaS service, you typically need to choose a different service plan or instance size within the same pricing tier. Azure App Service plans, for example, come in various sizes, each with a specific combination of CPU, memory, and other resources. By selecting a different service plan or instance size, you can increase or decrease the memory available to your application.\n\nSo, while changing the pricing tier can affect the overall performance and resource allocation for a PaaS solution, including CPU and storage, adjusting the memory allocation typically involves selecting the right App Service Plan or instance size within the chosen tier."

One of its key features is isolation and segmentation.\n\nIsolation: Azure VNets provide a high level of isolation by default. Each VNet is logically isolated from other VNets in Azure, ensuring that resources within one VNet are not accessible from another VNet unless explicitly connected. This isolation is critical for maintaining security boundaries between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, or between different departments within an organization.\n\nSegmentation: Within a VNet, you can further segment your network using subnets. Subnets allow you to divide your VNet into smaller, more manageable sections, each with its own unique IP address range. This segmentation can improve security and performance by controlling traffic flow, implementing network security groups (NSGs) to enforce access controls, and enabling the use of route tables for custom routing."

    "answerDescription": "Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there are a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures.<br>With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you can protect your applications and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability",

Once your business rules have been formed, the policy definition or initiative is assigned to any scope of resources that Azure supports, such as management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, or individual resources. The assignment applies to all resources within the Resource Manager scope of that assignment. Subscopes can be excluded, if necessary.

Regions define the physical location of data centers, not access control.\n\nB. Using the same Azure Resource Manager template is a method for deploying VMs with similar configurations but doesn't directly relate to managing permissions or access control.\n\nD.

So I ended guessing this right :) \n\nB - it's a server, you need a serverless solution\nD - API, no! you need to migrate the whole app\nA - web app, no, NO because web requires a server. The web is nothing but a huge WAN composed of many, many LANs. \nC - Whereas logic apps at least tells no conflicting information and implies you can migrate the whole app to it. Also the word \"logic\" refers to the email app sending emails \"based on one rule\". So I imagine it is done automatically, or 'logically'. Hence they are requiring a ServerLESS solution!"

Typically, you choose a VM when you need more control over the computing environment than the other choices offer.<br>Box 2:<br>Azure Container Instances provide portable environments for virtualized applications.<br>Containers are becoming the preferred way to package, deploy, and manage cloud applications. Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage any virtual machines and without having to adopt a higher-level service.<br>Containers offer significant startup benefits over virtual machines (VMs). Azure Container Instances can start containers in Azure in seconds, without the need to provision and manage VMs.<br>Box 3:<br>Azure App Service is used to build, deploy and scale web apps.<br>Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that lets you create web and mobile apps for any platform or device and connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises. App Service includes the web and mobile capabilities that were previously delivered separately as Azure Websites and Azure Mobile<br>Services.<br>Box 4:<br>Azure Functions provide a platform for serverless code.<br>Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/paas-applications-using-app-services https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview",

Azure Cloud Shell is accessible through web browsers on devices like Windows, macOS, and Linux, but there is no official Azure Cloud Shell app for Android.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.

This means that all virtual machines associated with a subnet or network interface will be subject to the same NSG rules.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that NSGs are stateful, which means that if you create an inbound security rule to allow traffic, the return traffic will be allowed automatically.

Modify an Azure firewall\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over HTTP, you can use the following two solutions:\n\nB. Modify a network security group (NSG): An NSG is a fundamental Azure resource that allows or denies network traffic to and from Azure resources, such as virtual machines. By default, incoming traffic to a virtual machine is blocked. To allow incoming HTTP traffic (port 80), you need to create an NSG rule that permits inbound traffic on port 80 for the specific virtual machine (VM1).\n\nD. Modify an Azure firewall: Azure Firewall is a cloud-based network security service that provides stateful firewall capabilities. If you are using Azure Firewall to protect your virtual network, you need to create a rule that allows HTTP traffic (port 80) from the Internet to the specific virtual machine (VM1)."

This means that all inbound and outbound traffic to/from resources associated with the NSG is blocked. \n\nTo allow traffic to flow, you need to create inbound and/or outbound security rules explicitly in the NSG. These rules define the type of traffic (such as TCP or UDP), the source and destination IP addresses and ports, and the action (allow or deny).\n\nIt's important to note that NSGs are applied to subnets or network interfaces, not individual virtual machines. This means that all virtual machines associated with a subnet or network interface will be subject to the same NSG rules.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that NSGs are stateful, which means that if you create an inbound security rule to allow traffic, the return traffic will be allowed automatically. You don't need to create a separate outbound security rule to allow the return traffic."

The Owner role is a built-in role in Azure that provides full access to all resources in a resource group, including the ability to create, modify, and delete resources. \n\nWhen you assign the Owner role to a user or group, it grants them full access to all resources within the resource group. Multiple users or groups can be assigned the Owner role for a resource group, which allows for collaboration and delegation of responsibilities among different teams or individuals.\n\nIt's important to note that assigning the Owner role to multiple users or groups can increase the risk of accidental or intentional changes to resources within the resource group. Therefore, it's recommended to carefully consider the access needs of each user or group and assign roles accordingly to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or accidental changes."

You are charged monthly for all resources in a subscription. Therefore, to use different payment options per department, you will need to create a separate subscription per department.  You can create multiple subscriptions in a single Azure Active Directory tenant.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: A reservation is where you commit to a resource (for example a virtual machine) for one or three years. This gives you a discounted price on the resource for the reservation period.  Reservations do not provide a way to use different payment options per department.<br>C: A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources. You can view the total cost of all the resources in a resource group. However, resource groups do not provide a way to use different payment options per department.<br>D: A container instance is an Azure resource used to run an application.  Container instances do not provide a way to use different payment options per department.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription",

You also get free monthly credits to use toward other Azure services during that period. After the 12-month period, your account will be converted to a pay-as-you-go account, and you will be charged for any usage beyond the free services that were provided during the free trial.\nIt's important to keep track of your usage and monitor your billing to avoid unexpected charges.

This can be done by adding more resources to the existing resource, such as additional CPUs, memory, or storage.\n\nAn example of vertical scaling in a cloud environment is adding an additional CPU to an existing Azure virtual machine. This can be done by modifying the VM's size or configuration to include more CPUs, which will allow it to handle a larger workload or more concurrent requests.\n\nOther examples of vertical scaling in a cloud environment include adding more memory to a database server, or increasing the capacity of a storage volume.\n\nVertical scaling is typically used to address short-term or temporary increases in workload demand, and is often a faster and simpler way to scale a resource than horizontal scaling, which involves adding additional instances of a resource."

This is achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms. If a component fails, the system can automatically switch to a backup component. This provides a continuous user experience, which is what the question is asking for.\n\nDisaster Recovery, on the other hand, is about restoring a system after a major incident or disaster that causes a significant system outage. This could involve restoring from backups, switching to a disaster recovery site, etc. This process may not be immediate and could result in some downtime.\n\nSo, in the context of providing a continuous user experience in the event of a resource failure, High Availability is the correct answer."

A resource lock is a setting that you apply to a resource to prevent accidental deletion or modification of the resource. When a lock is applied to a resource, it blocks any operations that would modify or delete the resource.\n\nIf a resource lock is removed, it can leave the resource vulnerable to accidental deletion or modification. However, if the resource is associated with an Azure Blueprint, the Blueprint can automatically replace the lock to help protect the resource.

This helps you keep track of your spending on Azure resources and make informed decisions on cost optimization.\n\nWhile tags can be useful in categorizing and organizing Azure resources, they are not specifically designed to track the costs of those resources. For tracking costs, budgets in Azure Cost Management and Billing is the appropriate solution. With budgets, you can set spending limits and receive alerts when spending reaches a certain threshold, allowing you to monitor and manage your costs more effectively."

Here are three factors that you should consider when trying to identify which factors are affecting the costs of a resource:\n\nThe volume of outbound data: The volume of data that is transferred out of Azure can affect the costs of a resource. For example, if you have a resource that generates a large volume of outbound data, such as a web server that serves a lot of content to users, this can result in higher costs.\n\nThe service tier: The service tier that you choose for a resource can also affect its costs. For example, if you choose a higher service tier, such as a more powerful virtual machine, this can result in higher costs.\n\nThe Azure region: The Azure region in which a resource is deployed can also affect its costs. Azure regions are geographical areas that contain one or more data centers, and the costs of resources can vary depending on the region in which they are deployed."

You can use tags to identify resources that belong to a specific department or project, for example.\n\nOnce you have tagged your resources with the appropriate department or project information, you can use the Azure Cost Management + Billing service to generate reports and analyze costs by department or project. This can help you identify areas where you may be able to reduce costs or optimize your resource usage.\n\nBudgets and alerts can also be useful tools for monitoring and managing costs in an Azure subscription, but they are not specifically designed for identifying which department is responsible for the cost of each resource."

For example, a host might support 5 to 10 users depending on the resources allocated to it2.\nIn theory, you can set a very high maximum session limit, but practical limits depend on the performance and resource requirements of the applications being used3.\nSo, a host pool with 20 session hosts can support more than 20 simultaneous user connections, depending on how you configure the session limits and the load balancing strategy."

If you want to create a lock at a parent level, select the parent. The currently selected resource inherits the lock from the parent. For example, you could lock the resource group to apply a lock to all its resources.\n3) Give the lock a name and lock level. Optionally, you can add notes that describe the lock (in this case delete)\n4 (to remove the lock) To delete the lock, select the Delete button\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources?tabs=json#portal"

Users can read the resource but cannot delete or update it.\nCanNotDelete: This lock allows all operations except delete. Users can read and modify the resource but cannot delete it.\nBy applying multiple locks, you can ensure different levels of protection based on your needs.
