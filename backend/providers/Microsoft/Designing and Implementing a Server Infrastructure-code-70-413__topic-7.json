BranchCache only has the data that has been used by clients at the location (or data that has been pre-cached) but can only be accessed providing the primary server can be contacted, which means the branch can't be disconnected from the primary location. If you need data available even if the connection to the primary data center is unavailable, you need to use DFS-R. If you simply want to provide caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data, then BranchCache is a great solution.\n\nhttps://www.itprotoday.com/windows-78/dfs-r-vs-branchcache-branch-offices"
