This can be done by selecting the sales_amount column, right-clicking on it, and selecting \"Replace Values\". In the dialog box that appears, you can replace all negative values with 0.\n\nSelecting Column distribution and Column profile will provide you with an overview of the data distribution and profile of the sales_amount column, respectively, but it won't address the specific concern related to negative sales amounts.\n\nSelecting the sales_amount column and applying a number filter will help you filter the data based on sales amounts, but again, it doesn't address the specific concern about negative sales amounts"
