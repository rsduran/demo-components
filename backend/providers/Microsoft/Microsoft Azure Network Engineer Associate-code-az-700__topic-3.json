The third link does not indicate there is a way to route traffic to a specific app service based on location.

The only time you will need a Gateway is when you have on-Prem access requirements from Peered vNETS than ONLY one vNET can have gateway and other uses it as transit point to on-prem.\n\nAlso all subnets within the same vNET can communicate free with each other\n\nSo having 1 VM inspect and route traffic between all the subnets on both the virtual networks DOES NOT MAKE SENSE but anyway it requires 1 IP but if the vNETs were NOT peered than the VM acts as router and in that case 2 IPs"

However, configuring the UDRs to redirect traffic between subnets in the same VNET requires additional attention. While using the VNET address range as a target prefix for the UDR is sufficient, this also routes all traffic from one machine to another machine in the same subnet through the Azure Firewall instance. To avoid this, include a route for the subnet in the UDR with a next hop type of VNET. Managing these routes might be cumbersome and prone to error. The recommended method for internal network segmentation is to use Network Security Groups, which don't require UDRs."

Instead, subdomains (e.g., www.example.com) are used to set CNAME records.\nAfter setting up a CNAME record, all DNS resolution requests for that domain will be redirected to the target domain specified by the CNAME. Therefore, if a CNAME record is set for a subdomain, other types of DNS records like A records or TXT records cannot be set for that subdomain."

This variable is particularly useful when you want to rewrite the X-Forwarded-For header set by Application Gateway so that the header contains only the IP address without the port information.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/rewrite-http-headers-url"

This header is a comma-separated list of IP ports. There might be scenarios in which the backend servers only need the headers to contain IP addresses. You can use header rewrite to remove the port information from the X-Forwarded-For header. One way to do this is to set the header to the add_x_forwarded_for_proxy server variable. Alternatively, you can also use the variable client_ip"
