        "content": "Was pretty confident the answers were wrong before testing. Tested, and turns out I was correct. The outbound firewall rule is, by default, allowed on all network profile types. 99% of the time, the problem is with the inbound rule, which is NOT allowed on any profiles by default. The only time the outbound rule changes behavior is when it's set to a block rule and enabled. \n\nSo for the answers, it will depend upon if (1) the firewall rules match the network type of the device and (2) whether there are any explicit deny output ICMPv4 request block rules. We aren't told of any block rules and, given the firewall rules, it would SEEM to be safe to assume that the Inbound rules match the network type. If we do that, since computer one only accepts ICMPv4 requests from its private network and computer 2 accepts them from its public network, computer 3 can be pinged from both of them. So the answer should be, \n\nFirst box: Computer 2 and Computer 3\nSecond Box: Computer 1 and Computer 3\n\nThe problem with the question is that we aren't given enough information to make a decent informative decision."

In that case a GUI asks if the permissions should be converted to explicit permissions on the object or removed altogether.  Again, we must presume they have been converted to explicit permissions.  \n\nSo for User2, there is an explicit Group2 Write Deny which prevails over any allows.  Similar reasoning for User3 which is a member of Group2.  The answer is therefore: Yes No No  \n\nThe proximity rule raised by user LArrikin27 (inherited versus explicit) is important to know but does not come into play here since the permissions have all been converted to explicit.\n\nRawizz 2023-07-28"
