Contoso hires you to manage their Azure environment and resolve several operational issues.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>General -<br>Contoso's Azure environment contains the following resources. All resources are associated with the same subscription and are located in the East US region:<br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/az-720/image73.png\"><br>VPN users use Windows 10 computers with the built-in SSTP VPN client software.<br><br>Recent changes -<br>\u2022 You extend the IP address space of VNet1 and create subnets in the new IP address space.<br>\u2022 You allow users with computers that run the current version of MacOS to use the built-in VPN client for connecting to the point-to-site VPN.<br>\u2022 You enable a service endpoint on contosostorage1 to provide direct access to the storage content from all subnets in VNet1.<br>\u2022 You configure all business critical VM workloads to use encryption keys stored in all five key vaults.<br>\u2022 You enable a private endpoint on CosmosDB1 to provide direct access to its content from VNet1.<br>\u2022 The Contoso's data engineering team was recently tasked with using contosostorage1 blob storage to store database backups.<br>\u2022 You develop an automated process to deploy Azure VMs by using Azure Bicep. The passwords for the local administrator accounts are stored in the key vaults. You grant the team that initiates the deployment the Reader RBAC role to all key vaults.<br>\u2022 You deploy a multi-tier SharePoint Server environment into a subnet in VNet2. You implement network security groups (NSGs) to allow only specific ports between tiers in the subnet. You configure NSGs to use application security groups (ASGs) when designating the source and destination of cross-tier traffic.<br>\u2022 You deploy a secondary multi-tier SharePoint Server environment into a subnet in VNet3.<br>You create the following resources:<br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/az-720/image74.png\"><br><br>Issues -<br><br>DNS issues -<br><br>Reverse DNS lookup -<br>\u2022 Reverse DNS lookups from VNet1 return two records.

However, connections to CosmosDB1 from the on-premises environment should be using the private endpoint. You verify that connections to CosmosDB1 from VNet1 are using the private endpoint.<br><br>VM1 routing -<br>Internet traffic from VM1 is routed directly to the Internet.<br><br>VM2 routing -<br>After configuring RT12 to route internet traffic from VM1 through VM2, traffic reaches VM2 but then it is dropped. You verify that routing for VM2 is configured correctly.<br><br>Azure and SharePoint issues -<br><br>Azure Key Vault -<br>Access attempts to Azure Key Vault by VM workloads intermittently fail with the HTTP response code 429.<br><br>SharePoint in VNet2 -<br>SharePoint traffic between tiers is blocked by NSGs which is causing application failures.<br><br>SharePoint in VNet3 -<br>ASGs used in the NSG rules associated with the VNet2 subnet are not visible when configuring NSG rules in VNet3.<br><br>Permission issues -<br><br>Data engineering team -<br>The Contoso data engineering team is unable to view the contosostorage1 account in the Azure portal.<br><br>Azure VM deployment -<br>Azure VM deployments that use Azure Bicep are failing with an authorization error.

Traffic Analytics provides detailed insights into the network traffic and can help you identify the NSG rules that are blocking the traffic.\n\nWhile \"IP Flow Verify\" can also be useful for checking security rules, it checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a VM based on 5-tuple information (Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port, and Protocol). In this case, where you want to understand broader connectivity issues and access patterns, Traffic Analytics is more suitable."

Access logs in Azure Application Gateway provide detailed information about incoming client requests, including client IP, request type, URI, response status, and transaction latency, which are valuable for debugging application behaviour and issues.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that while the Firewall logs can provide insight into whether the WAF is blocking requests based on its rule set, the Access logs can give a more holistic view of what's happening, including requests that are not being blocked by the WAF but are still failing or causing performance issues.\n\nTherefore, in the context of the question where users are experiencing varied issues (access issues, load failures, and performance discrepancies), starting with Access logs (Option B) can indeed be the most beneficial approach.

A network security group is preventing incoming traffic to the port.\n\nThe Network Security Group (NSG) could be incorrectly configured to block inbound traffic on port 80, which is used for HTTP. This would prevent the Azure Load Balancer's health probes from reaching the VM, leading to it being marked as unhealthy.\n\nOption B, a proxy being configured, would typically not prevent health probes from reaching the VM.\n\nOption C, session persistence being configured, should not impact health probes as they would be independent of client sessions.\n\nOption D is less likely because if an application on the VM was blocking the port, outgoing packets would likely be affected too, which is not the case as per your description. However, it could be possible if there is some misconfiguration within the application or firewall settings at the OS level.

Here's a bit of context:\n\nThe default standard email protocol (SMTP) uses port 25 for email communication.\nHowever, many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and cloud services, including Azure, block outbound SMTP traffic over port 25 to prevent spam.\nGiven the situation, the problem could be that the email traffic is being sent over port 25, which might be blocked. Hence, it's not an issue with the priority of the rules, the protocol, or the application of the NSG itself. The issue is likely related to the port being used for the email traffic.\n\nAzure recommends using port 587 for secure email transmission or SMTP relay.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nB. Configure the source and destination ports for the NSG1 rule with a priority of 1000 to 587.\n\nThis change should allow the email application on VM1 to send emails successfully to external recipients."
