In Microsoft 365 and Defender for Endpoint, devices are often managed in groups (known as device groups or device collections). By adding the specific devices to a group, you can then configure the rule to apply only to that group. This ensures that the rule is only applied to the 10 devices you intend to target.\nOption D: Assign a tag to the devices.\n\nIncorrect. Assigning a tag to devices can help with organization and management within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, but it doesn\u2019t directly control rule application. Tags are useful for filtering and reporting but not for determining rule scope."

To effectively catch this communication pattern within the past 14 days, running the detection rule every 24 hours would be sufficient. This frequency allows you to regularly scan for the C2 traffic while balancing the resource usage and performance of your detection system."

This means we can already scan the past 14 days as stated in the question.\n\nNow, if we choose Option A, which is a 12-hour interval, it checks every 12 hours and scans back 48 hours. This is less than the 50 hours of the Command and Control (C&amp;C), making it the most balanced option. Therefore, I would choose Option A.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/custom-detection-rules"
