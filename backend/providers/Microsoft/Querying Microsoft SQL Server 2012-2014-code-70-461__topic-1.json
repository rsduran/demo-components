You can fix this by changing the territoryid of the salesperson with territoryid 2 into 1. Now there are customers from '2' but no salesperson for '2'. Still no result! THis is bercause of three-valued logic. Some salespersons have territoryid NULL, and thus the predicate \"territoryid &lt;&gt; all(select TerritoryID from sales.SalesPerson)\" evaluates to UNKNOWN, and not to true for any of the customers. :-( . So you have deal with the nulls, either in the source data or in the predicate: \"territoryid &lt;&gt; all(select isnull(TerritoryID,0) from sales.SalesPerson)\""

It gives the rank one for the first row and then increments the value by one for each row.\n- Rank(): used to specify rank for each row in the result set.  \n- Dense_Rank(): to specify a unique rank number within the partition as per the specified column value.  It is similar to the Rank function with a small difference.  If we have duplicate values, SQL assigns different ranks to those rows as well.  Ideally, you should get the same rank for duplicate values.\n- Ntile(): to distribute the number of rows in the specified (N) number of groups.  Each row group gets its rank as per the specified condition.\n\nIn the SQL Rank functions, we use the OVER() clause to define a set of rows in the result set.  You can also use SQL Partition by clause to define a subset of data in a partition."

    "answerDescription": "You can use the PIVOT and UNPIVOT relational operators to change a table-valued expression into another table. PIVOT rotates a table-valued expression by turning the unique values from one column in the expression into multiple columns in the output, and performs aggregations where they are required on any remaining column values that are wanted in the final output. UNPIVOT performs the opposite operation to PIVOT by rotating columns of a table-valued expression into column values.<br>References:<br>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177410(v=sql.105).aspx",

    "answerDescription": "Box 1: READ_COMMITTED -<br>READ COMMITTED specifies that statements cannot read data that has been modified but not committed by other transactions. This prevents dirty reads. Data can be changed by other transactions between individual statements within the current transaction, resulting in nonrepeatable reads or phantom data. This option is the SQL Server default.<br>The behavior of READ COMMITTED depends on the setting of the READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT database option<br>Box 2: REPEATABLE_READ:<br>REPEATABLE_READ specifies that statements cannot read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions and that no other transactions can modify data that has been read by the current transaction until the current transaction completes.<br>Shared locks are placed on all data read by each statement in the transaction and are held until the transaction completes. This prevents other transactions from modifying any rows that have been read by the current transaction.<br><br>Box 3: SERIALIZABLE -<br>SERIALIZABLE Specifies the following:<br>\u2711 Statements cannot read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions.<br>\u2711 No other transactions can modify data that has been read by the current transaction until the current transaction completes.<br>\u2711 Other transactions cannot insert new rows with key values that would fall in the range of keys read by any statements in the current transaction until the current transaction completes.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>Not READ:UNCOMMITTED:<br>Transactions running at the READ UNCOMMITTED level do not issue shared locks to prevent other transactions from modifying data read by the current transaction. READ UNCOMMITTED transactions are also not blocked by exclusive locks that would prevent the current transaction from reading rows that have been modified but not committed by other transactions. When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted modifications, which are called dirty reads.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017",
