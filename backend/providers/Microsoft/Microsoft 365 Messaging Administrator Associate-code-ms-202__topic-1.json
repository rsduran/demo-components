        "content": "This is BS question. SafetyNetHoldTime must match the replay lag time, but this is to ensure that you can restore database copy from a lagged copy using Safety Net if needed. If a member of DAG1 fails that had an active database copy, this database will be activated on another server that has HA copy of it (not the lagged copy). Lagged copy will be automatically converted into HA copy by replay lag manager if default settings were not changed. So the lagged copy and replay lag time have nothing to do with activating database copy after server loss, and no email message will be lost.  Lagged copy will come into play only if BOTH DAG1 members hosting HA copies of the database will be lost AT THE SAME TIME. This is not stated in the question. \nResume: There is no correct answer, and the existing question formulation doesn't make sense."
