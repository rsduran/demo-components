    "answerDescription": "Box 1: The Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator<br>The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator estimates the cost savings you can realize by migrating your workloads to Azure.<br>Note: The TCO Calculator recommends a set of equivalent services in Azure that will support your applications. Our analysis will show each cost area with an estimate of your on-premises spend versus your spend in Azure. There are several cost categories that either decrease or go away completely when you move workloads to the cloud.<br><br>Box 2: Azure Hybrid Benefit -<br>Azure Hybrid Benefit is a licensing benefit that helps you to significantly reduce the costs of running your workloads in the cloud. It works by letting you use your on-premises Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server and SQL Server licenses on Azure. And now, this benefit applies to RedHat and SUSE Linux subscriptions, too.<br>Scenario:<br>Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:<br>Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the modification of new and existing data is prevented for a<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0000600002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"> period of three years.<br>\u2711 On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the data in App1.<br>\u2711 Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be prevented.<br>\u2711 All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled.<br>\u2711 App1 must not share physical hardware with other workloads.<br>Reference:<br>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/<br>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/",
