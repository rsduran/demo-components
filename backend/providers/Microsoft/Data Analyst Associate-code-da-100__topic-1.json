This approach is more flexible than using the \"Video\" tile because it allows you to embed any web content, but it requires copying the embed code for the video from Microsoft Stream and pasting it into the tile configuration.\n\nOption B, using the \"Custom streaming data\" feature, allows you to create a real-time dashboard that displays data from various sources, including video streams. This approach may be more complex and require additional resources, but it offers the ability to display the video in real-time along with other data sources.\n\nSo, the correct option depends on your specific needs and resources."
