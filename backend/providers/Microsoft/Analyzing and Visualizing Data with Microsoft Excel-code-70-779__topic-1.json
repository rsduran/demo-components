D is far from being the solution as no sort options are available, at least in Excel 2016 which I used for testing.   B would break the desired table layout and besides it will not reach strict chronological order.  And finally with A the best that can be achieved (by sorting by Year) is that all the 2015 rows appear before 2016's and so on.  But there is no way to sort the months so that, for example, Feb shows before Apr.  Sorting by Date[Date] is not possible (an error shows because date values are not unique for each monthYear value).  So the best choice here is A.
