On the other hand, an Azure virtual machine scale set is designed to provide easy management of multiple virtual machines and automatic scaling of resources, which may not be necessary for this particular use case1.

The answer is correct. The solution is to increase the timeout in Pre-deployment approvals from 2 to 8hs (as is required by policy)\n\nAccording to me justification is as follows: Timeout condition of gate will fail / stop entire deployment process. This timeout option can be configured by expanding evaluation option available in pre-deployment condition -&gt; gates -&gt; evaluation option.\n\nAlso if \"pre-deployment approvals\" is enable that means it can add list of users who can approve or reject the deployment.

You can create a provisioning profile in the Apple Developer portal, download and install the profile on each device, and deploy the application package by using Xcode.\n\nRegistering the IDs of the devices in the Apple Developer portal is also necessary for provisioning and testing the application on each device. You can add the device IDs to the Apple Developer portal and create a new provisioning profile that includes the device IDs."

It can help identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data that may point to the root cause of issues. Therefore, by using analytics, the monitoring solution can parse logs from multiple sources and identify the root cause of issues.\n\nSynthetic monitoring is a technique that simulates user interactions with the application to detect potential issues. Directed monitoring is not a commonly used term in the context of monitoring tools. Alert management is a feature that helps to configure and manage alerts based on certain criteria. While these features can be useful in a monitoring solution, they do not directly address the requirements stated in the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. analytics."

The Azure Pipelines app for Teams enables you to receive notifications about completed builds, releases, pending approvals, and other events in your team's channels. You can also configure custom notifications for specific events using the Azure Pipelines service hooks. This solution requires minimal development effort and allows the team members to receive notifications in real-time within their familiar Teams interface. Option A, installing the Azure Boards app for Teams, would not provide build and release notifications. Options B and C, using Azure Automation or an Azure function, would require more development effort than installing the Azure Pipelines app for Teams."
