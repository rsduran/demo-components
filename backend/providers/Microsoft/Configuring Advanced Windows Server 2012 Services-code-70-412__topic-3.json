Also it can't be assumed that the role is already installed on the cluster, and you can specify the update schedule to start immediately in the command options. I don't believe the Invoke-cauScan cmdlet would run if the role were not installed. Also, even if the schedule wasn't set to run immediately but already existed, re-running option A would allow you to change the schedule to run the scan and update immediately, especially with the -Force argument. I'm going to have to go with option \"A\" here."

You can specify that the load be equally distributed among the hosts or that each host handle a specified load weight.<br>Note: Handling priority: When Single host filtering mode is being used, this parameter specifies the local host's priority for handling the networking traffic for the associated port rule. The host with the highest handling priority (lowest numerical value) for this rule among the current members of the cluster will handle all of the traffic for this rule. The allowed values range from 1, the highest priority, to the maximum number of hosts allowed (32). This value must be unique for all hosts in the cluster.<br>Reference: Network Load Balancing parameters.",

The utility has three major options: /forestprep, /domainprep, and /rodcprep. The /forestprep option runs first, extending the AD schema with new object and attribute classes that the new AD versionneeds. The /domainprep option creates new well-known objects in AD, App1ies security changes, and miscellaneous other bits. Finally, /rodcprep makes forest-wide security changes to allow read-only domain controller (RODC) functionality. The Windows Server2012 R2 version of adprep.exe can run on any server that runs a 64- bit version of Windows Server 2008 or later. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726995.aspx http://www.ipuptime.net/Multicast.aspx http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg144561(v=exchg.141).aspx http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address",
