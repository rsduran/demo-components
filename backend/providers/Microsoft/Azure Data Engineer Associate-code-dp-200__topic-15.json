Tumbling windows are a series of fixed-sized, non-overlapping, and contiguous time intervals. A tumbling window trigger has a one-to-one relationship with a pipeline and can only reference a singular pipeline. Tumbling window trigger is a more heavy weight alternative for schedule trigger offering a suite of features for complex scenarios(dependency on other tumbling window triggers, rerunning a failed job and set user retry for pipelines). \n\nonly with this type we can retry in case of failure, with just a scheduled trigger nope.\nthats it.\n\nregards"
