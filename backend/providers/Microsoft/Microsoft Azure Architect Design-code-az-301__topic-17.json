    "answerDescription": "Role-based access control (RBAC) focuses on user actions at different scopes. You might be added to the contributor role for a resource group, allowing you to make changes to that resource group.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: If your organization has many subscriptions, you may need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions.<br>B: There are a few key differences between Azure Policy and role-based access control (RBAC). Azure Policy focuses on resource properties during deployment and for already existing resources. Azure Policy controls properties such as the types or locations of resources. Unlike RBAC, Azure Policy is a default allow and explicit deny system.<br>D: Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview",

Then, you simply go into your subscription, click on 'create a custom role' and identify your role assignment details and you basically identify to which scope(s) you give that person access. In this case, you are giving yourself Owner rights on all the subscription except for that one resource group for which you just assigned that owner a lower permission level.\n\nNobody denies blueprints won't work, but what I'm writing more is potentially a more fail-proof solution for reasons already mentioned in various comments here."

The protocol is used to propagate these routes and other Gateway information between gateways. But it does not create routes. \n\nSomething that you can use the protocol for is to learn if a defined route is not available. Based on that the BGP can decide to re-route it through a secondary location.\n\nThus, to me the correct answers are:\n1.\tUser-defined routes (I don\u2019t think that the requested route, \u201cOutbound traffic to the Internet from workloads hosted on the virtual networks must be routed through the closest available on-premises site\u201d, is part of the Azure defaulted routes.\n2.\tBorder Gateway Protocol"

Answer NO\n3- This part is not too clear at first as the diagram doesn't really show boundaries so it is hard to know where the SQL database sits exactly but we know there is no service endpoint, so traffic will follow the default route. The default route is to the NVA  which seems to connect to expressroute connection and not the internet - it seems like there is no internet gateway at all. So answer NO\n\nYES, NO, NO"

    "answerDescription": "The web application firewall (WAF) in Azure Application Gateway helps protect web applications from common web-based attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks, and session hijacks. It comes preconfigured with protection from threats identified by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) as the top 10 common vulnerabilities.<br>ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public Internet and thus can be considered more secure than VPN-based solutions. This allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.<br>Reference:<br>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-in-public-preview/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/overview",

    "answerDescription": "Geo-redundant storage (GRS) is designed to provide at least 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) durability of objects over a given year by replicating your data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region. If your storage account has GRS enabled, then your data is durable even in the case of a complete regional outage or a disaster in which the primary region isn't recoverable.<br>GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, but that data is available to be read only if Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A, C: If a datacenter-level disaster (for example, fire or flooding) occurs, all replicas in a storage account using LRS may be lost or unrecoverable. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft recommends using zone-redundant storage (ZRS), geo-redundant storage (GRS), or geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS).<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs",

Most  companies either don't backup these platforms at all or, if they do, have OS-level backup or Templates only (the reason is simple - backups cost money).  \n2. Requirements say we must minimize cost - using GRS is justifiable option for PROD, DR and PET platforms but is definitely overkill for Test/Dev (GRS is too expensive for non-PROD environments; especially if we know some large Apps have multiple Test, Dev and QA environments) \nSo the most economical Backup option for Test/Dev VMs would be to use lower cost LRS and RM Templates\nBy doing so we accept risk associated with this approach just in order to reduce the cost\nNOTE: or course, this configuration should never be used on higher platforms (PROD/DR/PET) but it is perfectly suitable for Test/Dev \nIn short - i would pick Option C, as the least expensive Backup solution offered"
