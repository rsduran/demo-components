Managed apps (apps that you've included on the Protected apps list in your WIP policy) are allowed to access your enterprise data and will interact differently when used with unallowed, non-enterprise aware, or personal-only apps. For example, if WIP management is set to Block, your employees can copy and paste from one protected app to another protected app, but not to personal apps. Imagine an HR person wants to copy a job description from a protected app to the internal career website, an enterprise-protected location, but makes a mistake and tries to paste into a personal app instead. The paste action fails and a notification pops up, saying that the app couldn't paste because of a policy restriction. The HR person then correctly pastes to the career website without a problem.\nBut I just could not find the option within the policy itself.  So 3 Policies it is."

In this case, the task requires a full set of source files to build the image.\n    Running the Update Deployment Share Wizard (D) updates the share with changes made elsewhere, but it won't add new images unless they are already available in the source files.\n    Importing a full set of source files (B) provides the necessary components for MDT to create the installation media, including the Windows 11 image. This is the standard way to add new operating systems to MDT deployment shares.\n\nTherefore, importing a full set of source files, which contains the Windows 11 installation files, will address the issue of missing images and allow you to proceed with the Windows 11 in-place upgrade task sequence."

The policy would then be assigned to your managed devices. Once the policy is applied, the bookmarks will be added to Chrome automatically.\n\nTo deliver bookmarks using a configuration profile, you would need to create a file that contains the bookmark data. The file would then be pushed to your managed devices. Once the file is on the device, you would need to use a script to import the bookmarks into Chrome.\n\nThis process is more complex and time-consuming than using an app configuration policy.

Example: you can create a device category called \"iOS devices\" and then create a dynamic group called \"iOS devices\" and configure the rules to include only devices who match the device category \"iOS devices\" but the problem is that Android users could have selected that category for their device so this would NOT ensure specific platforms or versions are selected correctly."

Compliance policies in Intune are used to set rules for devices managed with Intune1.\n\nHowever, there is a setting in Intune\u2019s compliance policy settings that determines how Intune treats devices that haven\u2019t been assigned a device compliance policy. This setting has two values1:\n\nCompliant (default): Devices that aren\u2019t sent a device compliance policy are considered compliant.\nNot compliant: Devices that haven\u2019t received a device compliance policy are considered noncompliant.\nSo, if you want to apply a compliance policy from Intune to a device, it needs to be enrolled in Intune. It does not matter if the device is Azure AD registered or joined as long as the device is enrolled in Intune2"

Basically everyone but Group B can perform an enrollment. \n\nGiven:\nGroup A has the MDM role and consists of Users 1 and 3.\nGroup B has the MAM role and consists of Users 2 and 3.\nUser 4 is a Global Admin so for sure they can enroll.

Here\u2019s why:\n\nAzure AD Join: According to Microsoft\u2019s documentation1, when a device is joined to Azure AD, it is managed by Intune. The document states, \"Join this device to Azure Active Directory: Users enter the information they\u2019re asked, including their organization email address and password. This option joins the device in Microsoft Entra ID. They show as organization owned, and show as Microsoft Entra joined in the Intune admin center.

In this case, since you have a custom app in APK format that you need to deploy to Android devices, you would use the LOB app type in Microsoft Intune.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief explanation of each option:\n\nA. Built-in: These are apps that come pre-installed on the device. Since you\u2019re deploying a custom app, this option is not applicable.\nB. Android store: This refers to apps that are available on the Google Play Store. Since your app is custom and not on the Play Store, this option is not applicable.\nC. Managed Google Play: This is for publicly available Google Play Store apps that you want to manage and distribute in your organization. Since your app is a custom app and not on the Play Store, this option is not applicable.\nD. Line-of-business (LOB): This is the correct option for deploying custom apps that are not available on the public app store.\nE. Web link: This is for deploying a web link to a device. Since you\u2019re deploying an app and not a web link, this option is not applicable."
