The performance tuning tips currently provide suggestions like:<br>\u2711 Use PolyBase when you copy data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse.<br>\u2711 Increase Azure Cosmos DB Request Units or Azure SQL Database DTUs (Database Throughput Units) when the resource on the data store side is the bottleneck.<br>\u2711 Remove the unnecessary staged copy.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-performance",
