    "answerDescription": "From the scenario: SRV1 has 16 logical cores and hosts a SQL Server instance that supports a mission-critical application. The application has approximately<br>30,000 concurrent users and relies heavily on the use of temporary tables.<br>Box 1: Change the sisze of the tempdb log file.<br>The size and physical placement of the tempdb database can affect the performance of a system. For example, if the size that is defined for tempdb is too small, part of the system-processing load may be taken up with autogrowing tempdb to the size required to support the workload every time you restart the instance of<br>SQL Server. You can avoid this overhead by increasing the sizes of the tempdb data and log file.<br>Box 2: Add additional tempdb files.<br>Create as many files as needed to maximize disk bandwidth. Using multiple files reduces tempdb storage contention and yields significantly better scalability.<br>However, do not create too many files because this can reduce performance and increase management overhead. As a general guideline, create one data file for each CPU on the server (accounting for any affinity mask settings) and then adjust the number of files up or down as necessary.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>Not MAXDOP:<br>The MAXDOP setting is fine. From the exhibit we see that MAXDOP is set to 0. This is the default setting, which enables the server to determine the maximum degree of parallelism.<br>Note: When an instance of SQL Server runs on a computer that has more than one microprocessor or CPU, it detects the best degree of parallelism, that is, the number of processors employed to run a single statement, for each parallel plan execution. You can use the max degree of parallelism option to limit the number of processors to use in parallel plan execution.<br>References:<br>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175527(v=sql.105).aspx",

Data loss is confined to updates to the database since the snapshot's creation.\n\nFor example, before doing major updates, such as a bulk update or a schema change, create a database snapshot on the database protects data. If you make a mistake, you can use the snapshot to recover by reverting the database to the snapshot. Reverting is potentially much faster for this purpose than restoring from a backup; however, you cannot roll forward afterward."
