Item cross-references\n\nExplanation:\n\nItem cross-references in Dynamics 365 Business Central allow you to set up vendor-specific item numbers and descriptions. This feature is useful when vendors use different item numbers or descriptions than those used in your company. When you create a purchase order or other document, you can use the vendor's item number, and Business Central will automatically recognize it as your internal item number. This helps to avoid confusion and ensures accuracy in your transactions with the vendor."

You can set up different SKUs for the same item at different locations (warehouses), each with its own vendor and pricing information.\n\nD. Item card: The item card is where you set up the basic information about an item. This includes the item's number, description, unit of measure, and other details. You can also link the item to its corresponding SKUs here.\n\nE. Locations: Locations in Business Central represent physical or logical storage places, such as warehouses. You need to set up a location for each warehouse, and then tie transactions to these locations. This allows you to track inventory, sales, and purchases by location."

Each box contains 12 pieces. Each pallet contains 144 pieces.\n\nThe base unit of measure is the smallest unit of measure that is used to track inventory. In this case, the base unit of measure is pieces.\n\nAn item unit of measure is a unit of measure that is used to sell or purchase an item. In this case, the item unit of measure is a box.\n\nThe quantity per unit is the number of base units of measure that are in one item unit of measure. In this case, the quantity per unit is 12.\n\nTherefore, the correct way to assign the unit of measures is to create Pieces as a base unit of measure and add Box as an item unit of measure with the quantity per unit set to 12."

Add Pallet as an item unit of measure with the quantity per unit set to 144.\n\nHere's why this is the most suitable option:\n\nPieces is the term your customer wants to use for their items, so it makes sense to set it as the base unit. This aligns with how they think about and sell their products.\nPallet is the largest unit your customer uses, and it contains a fixed number of pieces (144). Defining it as an item unit with a conversion factor of 144 pieces per pallet allows for easy calculations when buying or selling in pallet quantities.\nBox is an intermediate unit, containing 12 pieces. While you could define it as an item unit as well, it's not strictly necessary since the conversion between boxes and pieces can be easily derived from the conversion between pallets and pieces (1 box = 144 pieces / 12 pieces/box = 12 pieces)."

The finance and accounting teams will remain in the original location.<br><br>The company uses a third-party system for financials and order management.
