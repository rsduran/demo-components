They operate in the cities (and surrounding metropolitan areas) of Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Houston, and Seattle.<br><br>These grooming services are offered as packages at multiple price points, such as \"basic bath\" for $50 and \"premium bath with nail trim\" for $75.<br><br>Contoso also sells branded merchandise (hats, shirts, etc.) and dog accessories (toys, leashes, collars, etc.) through its own eCommerce website.<br><br>Customer Service and Marketing Overview. Customer Service<br><br>Contoso maintains a single contact center from which its customer service agents book appointments and handle customer complaints for each geographic market Contoso serves.<br><br>Customer service agents use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service to document inbound customer booking inquiries and complaints that are received via phone call, text message and web chat.<br><br>Customer service agents schedule grooming appointments using a third-party, web-based scheduling application.<br><br>Customer Service and Marketing Overview. Marketing<br><br>The marketing team manages an informational website and is responsible for running campaigns through web advertising platforms and social media channels. The marketing team also produces a weekly email newsletter that contains educational content relevant to dog owners as well as promotions for Contoso\u2019s services and products.<br><br>Contoso uses a third-party marketing automation platform to send email and SMS messages to customers. These communications currently include:<br><br>1. All unique email addresses from the booking system, ecommerce system and Dynamics 365 Customer Service receive the weekly email newsletter described above. The same customer will receive multiple emails if the customer is associated with different email addresses in different systems.<br>2. Customers receive SMS reminders the day before a scheduled grooming appointment.<br>3. Each customer who purchases grooming services is sent an email with a link to a satisfaction survey on the first Tuesday following the grooming appointment. The survey link is the same for all customers, and the survey requires customers to enter their names, phone numbers and (optionally) email addresses as part of the submission.<br><br>Customer Service and Marketing Overview. Challenges<br><br>Currently, the customer service team does not have any way to relate survey responses back to individual customer records in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service.<br><br>The marketing team cannot access customer feedback data collected by the customer service team. Both the customer service team and marketing team cannot access any data from the ecommerce system.<br><br><br>Business Objectives -<br><br>Contoso business leadership identifies three major objectives to address by the end of the current fiscal year:<br><br>1. Improve customer retention - Current customer attrition rates exceed 40 percent each month.<br>2. Maximize customer value for services - The leadership team believes customer service agents should be upselling more customers on premium grooming packages. The leadership team is also considering partnering with other organizations to offer related services like dog training and dog walking to its existing customers.<br>3. Maximize customer value for merchandise and accessory sales - Fewer than five percent of grooming customers have ever made a purchase from the ecommerce site. The leadership team believes there are significant opportunities for new revenue by increasing ecommerce sales.<br><br><br>Project Overview. Overview -<br><br>The customer service and marketing leaders believes a Microsoft Customer Data Platform will help achieve Contoso\u2019s business objectives.<br><br>The information technology (IT) team starts a pilot implementation of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.<br><br><br>Project Overview. Pilot Project -<br><br>The pilot implementation will use the following sources of data from Contoso's operational systems:<br><br>\u2022 Bookings - Customer demographic data and completed grooming appointments<br>\u2022 Web purchases - Customer demographic data and ecommerce purchases totals summarized by customer, type (branded merchandise or accessories) and date<br>\u2022 Survey responses - Respondent demographic data and response data<br>\u2022 Customer interactions - Customer demographic data, interaction history (phone calls, emails, web chat), customer feedback, and inquiries<br><br>There is no common customer key across the different data sources, and none of the customer tables store customer keys from the other sources. Every table in a specific data source can be associated back to a customer record from the same data source using the corresponding customer's primary key.<br><br>When managing system refreshes, Contoso requires data refreshes to begin within one hour of the scheduled arrival time for flat-file sources.<br><br>No Microsoft Azure storage services have been provisioned in support of the project, but the Customer Data Platform specialist may request the provisioning of any Azure services necessary to achieve the stated business objectives.<br><br>The goal of the pilot project is to demonstrate that Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights will provide marketing and customer service users with relevant data and insights. These data and insights will allow users to reduce churn, increase services revenue, and increase eCommerce spend.<br><br><br>Data Sources. Bookings -<br><br>This data source consists of two Parquet files that are uploaded to a secure file transport protocol (SFTP) site at noon (12 PM) and midnight (12 AM) every day.<br><br>1.

Respondents.json - customer id (primary key), name, phone number, email address<br>2. Responses.json - response id (primary key), customer id, satisfaction score (1-5), comments, response date<br><br>Note: The satisfaction survey asks for a single satisfaction score on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 meaning extremely dissatisfied and 5 meaning extremely satisfied. Respondents may optionally include comments.<br><br>Data Sources. Customer Interactions<br><br>This data source consists of a connection to data from the Contoso Dynamics 365 Customer Service application through a Microsoft Dataverse managed data lake.
