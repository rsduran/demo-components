If the question had said the user could not REGISTER their device, then the fact that others could do the action would matter because you can either allow everyone to register or no one. You can't have some being able to register and some not, which would mean that the device limit would naturally be the next logical choice. But in this case, they said JOIN, and you can configure certain users to be able to join devices and others not. So the first thing you'd check is if the user has rights to JOIN devices, and if they do then *maybe* B. The maximum number of devices per user is a universal setting. Before I go and change a setting that affects all users, I would first look to see if this user has an unusually high number of devices and remove some of them. If a lot of my users were nearing 20, then B."
