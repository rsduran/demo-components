    "answerDescription": "Set the forest function level and the Domain functional level both to Windows Server 2003.<br>Also check Domain Name (DNS) server.<br>Note:<br>* When you deploy AD DS, set the domain and forest functional levels to the highest value that your environment can support. This way, you can use as many AD<br>DS features as possible. For example, if you are sure that you will never add domain controllers that run Windows Server 2003 to the domain or forest, select the<br>Windows Server 2008 functional level during the deployment process. However, if you might retain or add domain controllers that run Windows Server 2003, select the Windows Server 2003 functional level.<br>* You can set the domain functional level to a value that is higher than the forest functional level. For example, if the forest functional level is Windows Server<br>2003, you can set the domain functional level to Windows Server 2003 or higher.<br>Reference: Understanding Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Functional Levels",

Therefore you extend replication from VM1 on Host2.<br>Note 2: With Hyper-V Extend Replication feature in Windows Server 2012 R2, customers can have multiple copies of data to protect them from different outage scenarios. For example, as a customer I might choose to keep my second DR site in the same campus or a few miles away while I want to keep my third copy of data across the continents to give added protection for my workloads. Hyper-V Replica Extend replication exactly addresses this problem by providing one more copy of workload at an extended site apart from replica site.<br>Reference: Hyper-V Replica: Extend Replication<br>http://blogs.technet.com/b/virtualization/archive/2013/12/10/hyper-v-replica-extend-replication.aspx",
