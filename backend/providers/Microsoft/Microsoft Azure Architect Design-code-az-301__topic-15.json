It's up to you to perform any remediation required. When you're ready to begin the migration process, Azure Database Migration Service performs all of the required steps.

We would enable the recording of the DB metrics via \"Diagnostic Settings\". There we can choose between \"Send to Log Analytics\", \"Archive to a storage account\" and \"Stream to an event hub\". Streaming to an event hub doesn't make sense in this scenario as we don't want to do any stream based analysis on top of the metrics. I think its important to keep the metrics for some time for later analysis and both Log Analytics and a storage account would allow for this.
