That feature will meet the technical requirements which is to block people from printing. The IRM feature works on both Email and SharePoint and will block users from printing and taking screenshots with Print Screen for example. It however sadly doesn't block people from memorizing content or writing it down or taking photos with their phone or taking screen shots with third party software. Lucky the question is just focused on easy basic stuff and not on all that technical stuff so just go with IRM for this one and you'll be set"
