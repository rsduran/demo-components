However, in some cases, users may need policy applied to them based on the location of the computer object alone. You can use the Group Policy loopback feature to apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that depend only on which computer the user logs on to.<br>Reference:<br>https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/kb/231287",
