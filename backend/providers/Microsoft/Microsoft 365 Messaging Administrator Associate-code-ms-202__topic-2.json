Check with - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow/mail-routing/mail-routing?view=exchserver-2019.\n\"After the message arrives at a Mailbox server in the DAG, the Transport service routes the message to the Mailbox Transport Delivery service on the DAG member that holds the active copy of the destination mailbox database. The Mailbox Transport Delivery service then delivers the message to the local mailbox database. Although a DAG might contain Mailbox servers located in different Active Directory sites, the DAG defines the delivery group, not the Active Directory site.\""
