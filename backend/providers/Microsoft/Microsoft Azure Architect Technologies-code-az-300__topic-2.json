If we think that it isn't associate, we can modify subnet if it don't any any VM associate (I checked). Then, we can modify 10.1.1.0/24 to a new subnet with less IPs, changing address space to 10.1.1.0/25. In this way, we have subnet1 from 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.127 ip address. Then we will have an address space from 10.1.1.128 to 10.1.1.255 free. So, we can create GatewaySubnet for example with 10.1.1.128/28 address space.\nE: Deleted Subnet1. We can do this solution only if subnet1 don't have any VM associate, else we can't deleted. So, if there isn't a VM then is better solution B and modify subnet, because if we deleted subnet1 we can create a Gatewaysubnet but we already need subnet1 to attach the VM."

Even that anyone ask through HTTP port (I mean inbound port rules), nobody will answer through this port due to Rule3 on Outbound Port Rules.\n\nSo keeping this in mind, correct answers should be:\n\"cannot connect to the web server and DNS server on VM1\"\n\"can connect to only the DNS server on VM1\"\n\nAnyone agree?"

In other words, it doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for that task.<br>Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam in the time provided.<br>Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be able to return to the lab.<br><br>To start the lab -<br>You may start the lab by clicking the Next button.<br>You plan to create several virtual machines in different availability zones, and then to configure the virtual machines to load balanced connections from the internet.<br>You need to create an IP address resource named ip1006 to support the planned load balancing solution.<br>The solution must minimize costs.<br>What should you do from the Azure portal?<br>",
