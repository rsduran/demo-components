Before you can assign a license to a user, you must specify the Usage location property for the user. You can specify the location under the User &gt; Profile &gt; Settings section in the Azure portal.\n\nWhen Azure AD attempts to assign a group license to a user whose usage location isn't supported, it fails and records an error on the user.\n\nTo solve this problem, remove users from unsupported locations from the licensed group. Alternatively, if the current usage location values don't represent the actual user location, you can modify them so that the licenses are correctly assigned next time (if the new location is supported).\n\nPowerShell: PowerShell cmdlets report this error as ProhibitedInUsageLocationViolation."
