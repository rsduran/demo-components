Along with the benefits of leveraging infrastructure in the cloud, your organization's most critical assets may be exposed to threats. Exposed assets include storage instances with potentially sensitive information, compute resources that operate some of your most critical applications, ports, and virtual private networks that enable access to your organization.<br>Connecting AWS to Defender for Cloud Apps helps you secure your assets and detect potential threats by monitoring administrative and sign-in activities, notifying on possible brute force attacks, malicious use of a privileged user account, unusual deletions of VMs, and publicly exposed storage buckets.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-iot/device-builders/security-edge-architecture https://samilamppu.com/2021/11/04/multi-cloud-security-posture-management-in-microsoft-defender-for-cloud/",

Yes, creating private endpoints for the web app and the database layer is a recommended solution to secure the connection between the two layers and meet the Zero Trust model.\n\nPrivate endpoints allow you to access your Azure PaaS services over a private IP address within your virtual network. By creating private endpoints for both the web app and the MongoDB database, traffic between them can be routed through the private network, making it more secure by preventing access from the public internet.\n\nThis approach is recommended because it limits access to only the virtual network where the web app and database are deployed, and it helps to minimize the surface area of potential attacks. By implementing private endpoints, you can ensure that data is transmitted securely between the two layers and reduce the risk of data breaches.\n\nTherefore, creating private endpoints for the web app and the database layer meets the goal of securing the connection between the two layers and follows the Zero Trust model."
