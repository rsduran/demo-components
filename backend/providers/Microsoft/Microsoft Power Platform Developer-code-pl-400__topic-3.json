This means that the first ClearCollect method will finish running before the second ClearCollect method starts running, and so on. This can cause the app to run slowly, especially if the collections are large.\n\nThe Concurrent method allows you to run multiple actions at the same time. This can help to improve the performance of your app by reducing the amount of time it takes to run all of the ClearCollect methods."

You plan to integrate the app with an external system.<br>The application must not authenticate by using a Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user account.<br>You need to enable the application to authenticate to Dataverse.<br>Which four actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.<br>Select and Place:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0020000001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>",

    "answerDescription": "Step 1: Register the application in Azure AD with appropriate permissions.<br>App registration in Azure Active Directory is typically done by ISVs who want to develop external client applications to read and write data in Dataverse.<br>Registering an app in Azure Active Directory provides you with Application ID and Redirect URI values that ISVs can use in their client application's authentication code.<br>Step 2: Use the Azure AD application id and secret as credentials in the application.<br><br>Add credentials -<br>Credentials are used by confidential client applications that access a web API. Examples of confidential clients are web apps, other web APIs, or service-type and daemon-type applications. Credentials allow your application to authenticate as itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime.<br>You can add both certificates and client secrets (a string) as credentials to your confidential client app registration.<br>Step 3: Create the application user in Dataverse using the Application User form.<br>App registration can also be done by an application developer or individual user who is building a client application to connect to and read/write data in Dataverse.<br>Use the Application ID and Redirect URI values from your registered app in your client application's authentication code to be able to connect to Dataverse environment from your client application, and perform the required operations. Note that if the app is registered in the same tenant as your Dataverse environment, you won't be presented with a consent form when connecting from your client application to your Dataverse environment.<br>Note: When end users use the ISV's application for the first time to connect to their Dataverse environment by providing their Dataverse credentials, a consent form is presented to the end user. After consenting to use their Dataverse account with the ISV's application, end users can connect to Dataverse environment from external application. The consent form is not displayed again to other users after the first user who has already consented to use the ISV's app. Apps registered in Azure Active Directory are multi-tenant, which implies that other Dataverse users from other tenant can connect to their environment using the ISV's app.<br>Step 4: Assign a security role to the application user in Dataverse<br>Grant access to users that already have a Dynamics 365 license<br>Any user who already has a license for any model-driven app in Dynamics 365 also will be able to access Dynamics 365 Marketing without requiring any additional licenses. All you need to do is assign them the security roles and privileges required to access the Marketing features they need.<br>Incorrect:<br>* Grant the Dataverse application user the Access Dynamics 365 as organization users permission in Azure AD.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/walkthrough-register-app-azure-active-directory https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/marketing/admin-users-licenses-roles",

Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.<br><br>The recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.<br><br>The company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:<br><br>\u2022 JobPosting<br>- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser<br>- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser<br>\u2022 Contact (Job Applicant)<br>- Contact identifier<br>- First name<br>- Last name<br>- Time-Zone Offset<br>- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)<br>\u2022 Application proapplication<br>- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact<br>- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting<br>- pro_recruiterassignedid<br>\u2022 Interview<br>- Application - lookup to Application<br>- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting<br>- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)<br>- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value<br>\u2022 Referral<br>- Contact - lookup to Contact<br>- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser<br>- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting<br>\u2022 SystemUser<br>- Manager - lookup to SystemUser<br>- Time-Zone Offset<br>\u2022 Recruiter<br>- Recruiter identifier<br>- Recruiter name<br><br><br>Applications<br> -<br>There may be multiple applications associated with each job posting. Applications are linked to an employee record if an employee referred the applicant for a position. The same individual can be an applicant for multiple job postings.<br><br><br>Interviews<br> -<br>Each interview is performed by an employee and is related to a single application.<br><br>The interview scheduling process may force potential candidates to accept interviews at unusual times with the senior team members due to time-zone differences.<br><br>Requirements. Interview Scheduling<br><br>The system must provide recruiters with a list of team members and their time-zone information. You must create a Microsoft Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control for the Job Application form to display a list of senior team members who report directly to a hiring manager.<br><br>\u2022 The control must display the current time in each team member's local time.<br>\u2022 The control must be bound so that it minimizes the amount of code that must be written.<br>\u2022 You must display the list of team members and sort the list to show team members who reside in time zones closest to the applicant's time zone first.<br><br>You must develop a second PCF control that displays the time-zone name and current time on the Job Application form. You must display the data in the candidate\u2019s local time.<br><br>Requirements. Historical Information Tracking<br><br>You must create a process to identify individuals as a person of interest that the company should consider hiring. You must assign each individual a score based on their past interactions.<br><br>\u2022 You must be able to determine the following information about a candidate:<br>- The number of interviews in the past two years and whether team members provided recommendations<br>- The number of hiring manager referrals and employee referrals in the past two years<br>- Whether the individual has any of the 12 designations or certifications that the company considers significant<br>\u2022 Only a single referral can be made per job application. The system must be able to support multiple referrals for a candidate.<br>\u2022 The system must track referrals even if an application is not completed.<br><br>Requirements. Historical Information Scoring<br><br>The automated process must run weekly to assess all candidates. The process must also run automatically when historical information is updated. You must be able to perform scoring by selecting a command button on the contact form.<br><br>\u2022 This new command button must only be visible to employees who belong to a security role assigned named Recruiter. The command button must not be visible to anyone unless the contact form is in Update mode.<br>\u2022 A person of interest is defined as having a score of 15 or more based on the following historical information criteria:<br>- Each interview with a recommendation adds two to the score.<br>- Each interview without a recommendation subtracts two from the score.<br>- Each employee or manager referral adds one to the score.<br>- Each designation or certification adds one to the score.<br>\u2022 All scoring elements must be recalculated when changes occur. You must assign the score to the Person of interest field.<br>\u2022 Values representing totals or scores must be stored in their own numeric fields.<br>\u2022 Plug-ins must be used to keep the Person of Interest field on active interview records associated with the Contact.<br>\u2022 Plug-ins registered on the update of the Person of interest field must send an email notification when the candidate named in the email is a person of interest. Recruiters must receive the message when the field is updated on the Contact record.<br>\u2022 Interviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the interview record is successfully updated.<br><br>Requirements. Design Guidelines<br><br>The following design guidelines must be followed:<br><br>\u2022 Schema changes must be made using the method requiring the least amount of storage to meet the requirement.<br>\u2022 Out-of-the-box functionality must be used when possible.<br>\u2022 Any code required to calculate scores must be able to be run from a single point.<br>\u2022 Email notifications need to be kept to a minimum.<br><br><br>Issues<br> -<br><br>\u2022 Recruiters report that the command button to score a candidate is not working. You debug the code and observe that the context input parameter is null.<br>\u2022 The system does not support associating designations and certifications with candidates.<br>\u2022 The value for the field used by the PCF control to display local time is saved to Microsoft Dataverse each time an active application record is opened.<br>\u2022 Interviewers report that they do not receive email notifications when interview records are created for an existing person of interest.<br><br><br>You create the following Fetch XML query to determine the number of interviews where there are no recommendations for an applicant.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/pl-400/image425.png\"><br><br>For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true.

This approach is particularly useful when you need to handle the integration and data access at a more granular level.\n\nOption A (Canvas app that uses the custom connector) is more suitable for user interactions and creating custom experiences.\n\nOption C (Power Automate flow that uses the custom connector) is suitable for workflow automation but may not provide the same level of control as a custom plug-in.\n\nOption D (Webhook that contacts the Web API) is typically used for asynchronous communication and may not be the best choice for direct, synchronous interaction with the Web API."
