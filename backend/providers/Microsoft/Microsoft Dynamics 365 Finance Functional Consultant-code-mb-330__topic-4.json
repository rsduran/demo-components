A sales agreement is a contract that commits the customer to buy products in a specific quantity or for a specific amount over time, in exchange for special prices and discounts.

For sales where a sales trade agreement applies, this price takes priority over the item base price^2^]. A sales agreement and a sales trade agreement are different features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, and they have different setup and usage processes.

The company is experiencing a rapid expansion not only in its supplements but as a lifestyle brand that also sells apparel. The supplements and apparel businesses operate independently but manufacture and operate in the same legal entity.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br>Current environment. Technology<br><br>Trey Research is migrating from an outdated, on-premises version of Dynamics AX to Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. The company wants to retain a lot of its current data structures and processes but adopt new efficiencies when the benefit is obvious. The company uses a third-party e-commerce site that is custom developed by an internal developer.<br><br><br>Current environment. Items<br> -<br><br><br>Product numbering <br> -<br><br>All items are numbered by using a smart numbering format: [Product SKU+Size+Color+Style]. For reporting, items are queried for sales and inventory reports by using the first six digits of the item number or until the first dash is encountered. <br><br>\u2022 A t-shirt could be 01001-S-Red for item 1001 in a size small with the color red. <br>\u2022 A single energy drink could be 02001-12oz or 02001-20oz for the different sizes that product 02001 is sold in. <br><br><br>Product attributes <br> -<br><br>\u2022 All clothing shares the same set of product attributes. <br>\u2022 Supplements may share the same Product SKU but can have different attributes for the different size, color, or style variations of the product. <br>\u2022 Product attributes that are unnecessary for an item should be excluded from the item. <br><br><br>Pricing <br> -<br><br>\u2022 All items always have a default price. This price will not expire. <br>\u2022 An item will have four different prices created for it every month, one for each customer tier, as detailed later in this section. The pricing expires at the end of the month. If no special pricing is created, the default item price will be used. <br>\u2022 The monthly sales price in which the additional price breaks are determined is based on the estimated cost of the manufactured items. <br>\u2022 Customers are categorized into four pricing tiers (A, B, C, and D) based on sales volume over the past 12 months. <br>\u2022 Customers can negotiate special pricing for items in 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day increments. Quantity restrictions may be placed, depending on the item discount and promotion. <br>\u2022 Promotional pricing is not used today. Pricing is restricted to monthly prices and customer-specific contract pricing. <br><br><br>Cost <br> -<br><br>Items use a FIFO costing model today in their current Dynamics AX 2009 environment; however, using the FIFO costing method has created problems.<br><br>Current environment. Warehouse and inventory<br><br>\u2022 Warehouse requirements are simplistic. There is only one site. The site has two warehouses. <br>\u2022 Trey Research needs to make sure that any energy drinks and nutritional supplements are manufactured and packaged with the highest standards. Trey Research automatically inspects products when all products are reported as finished. All products are inspected again when the items are picked. <br>\u2022 Energy drinks require independent tests to check for dents in packaging, carbonation levels, and fill level. <br>\u2022 Nutritional supplements require separate tests for packaging, expiration date, product seal, and product labeling. <br>\u2022 Government compliancy and consistency testing are handled outside of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. <br>\u2022 Resalable products are placed on one of two racks in the warehouse.<br><br><br>Requirements <br> -<br><br><br>Requirements. Technology<br> -<br><br>\u2022 Trey Research will integrate all pricing and discount capabilities to its e-commerce website.<br><br><br>Requirements. Items<br> -<br><br>\u2022 Reporting on products should be streamlined as much as possible. <br>\u2022 The item numbering does not have to equate to the actual item number. <br>\u2022 The future costing methods adopted must be commonly accepted for manufacturers. <br>\u2022 Inventory costing should be done after a full inventory valuation is complete. It should take into consideration the direct materials, direct labor, and overhead that goes into an item. <br>\u2022 Any costing method used needs the ability to track cost records about an item, cost categories, and calculation formulas for indirect costs. <br>\u2022 The profitability for nutritional supplements manufacturing processes needs to be expressed in terms of the cost categories for routing operations and the calculation formulas for manufacturing overheads. <br>\u2022 If a vendor can no longer deliver the raw materials for the energy drinks due to supply chain issues, the costs for using an alternative vendor to source the raw materials should be used to determine the impact on profits. <br>\u2022 Apparel items will not be upgraded to the new costing method until after the go-live date due to resourcing and implementation limitations from the apparel team.<br><br><br>Requirements. Pricing <br> -<br><br>\u2022 Trey Research plans to do promotional pricing. Certain products will receive special pricing during the hours of extreme sporting events that Trey Research sponsors. Before or after the event, normal pricing will resume.<br><br><br>Requirements. White labeling <br> -<br><br>\u2022 Trey Research wants to start white labeling its products under the brands of major nutritional retail store brands. These products would only be sold to specific customers. <br>\u2022 Trey Research will provide and maintain a 'Compare to' price for customers to use to compare the white-labeled products. This Compare to price will also be the default item price for the customer if the customer accidentally lets a contract price expire. <br>\u2022 The configuration of these restrictions must be applied automatically when creating new products for those customers.<br><br>Requirements. Warehouse and inventory <br><br>\u2022 If products in the warehouse must be blocked from transactions for a specific reason, such as a health and safety review, warehouse users should be able to block the products quickly from the ERP system. <br>\u2022 All product quality tests should be processed in a uniform and consistent manner. <br>\u2022 Creation of any quality processes for products inbound to the warehouse, from the production line, or outbound from the warehouse to consumers should be automatically created to facilitate execution. <br>\u2022 Testing requirements:<br>\u25e6 Requirement 1: 100 percent of all nutritional supplements and 50 percent of all energy drinks must be tested when production orders are completed. After a product is in testing, 100 percent of all tests must be completed. <br>\u25e6 Requirement 2: 75 percent of all nutritional supplements and energy drinks should be tested against their required tests during an outbound process. <br>\u25e6 Damaged products must be placed in one of four bins (based on product type) during the inspection process. <br>\u25e6 You must define quarantine zones to optimize product visibility throughout the testing process.<br><br><br>You need to configure the extreme sports discounts.<br><br>Which component should you use?

These include items such as pens, pencils, paper, notebooks, chalk, desks, acrylic paints, blackboards, dry erase markers, and whiteboard paint. Due to increased demand for colored pencils, lead times are longer for these pencils. School of Fine Art plans to expand sales into this market.<br><br>School of Fine Art plans to implement Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to manage the business.<br><br>Current environment. Company structure<br><br>School of Fine Art consists of two legal entities.<br><br><br>Primary company -<br><br>\u2022 Located in Dublin, Ireland.<br>\u2022 Has a single named warehouse.<br>\u2022 Is the primary distribution center for both companies.<br><br><br>Second company -<br><br>\u2022 Is located in Glasgow, Scotland.<br>\u2022 Includes the following warehouses: Glasgow1, Glasgow2.<br>\u25cb Glasgow1 is used primarily to supply items regionally.<br>\u25cb Glasgow2 serves as local storage for vendor-owned inventory and bulk storage for School of Fine Art's inventory.<br><br>Current environment. General processes<br><br>School of Fine Art uses a combination of spreadsheets and paper forms to manage the business.<br><br>\u2022 All sales, purchases, and inventory are tracked in spreadsheets that are password protected by managers.<br>\u2022 Managers frequently share spreadsheet passwords so that other users can make edits on their behalf. Inventory quantities and values are unreliable.<br>\u2022 The spreadsheets are often incorrectly updated, have entry errors, and broken formulas for calculations.<br>\u2022 Purchase order receipts, picking lists, packing slips, and invoices are all handwritten on pre-printed, three-part forms.<br>\u2022 Late summer is the company's busiest time. During this time, workers are typically on the warehouse floor or making rush deliveries to schools to meet last-minute needs.<br><br>Current environment. Inventory and warehousing<br><br>\u2022 School of Fine Art values inventory by using FIFO costing methods.<br>\u2022 Inventory in the warehouses cannot be distinguished as available inventory or inventory that is sold to a customer and waiting to be picked. This creates inventory inflation during cycle counts and later shortages because warehouse workers count items that are already promised to customers and waiting to be shipped.<br>\u2022 Glasgow2 space is fully allocated to vendors.<br>\u2022 Due to space constraints, school orders for photocopiers are shipped from the vendor to the school.<br>\u2022 Crayons are stored as separate item numbers depending on whether they are in a box or a case. This creates issues when counting inventory to determine the total number of crayons in stock.<br>\u2022 Lack of inventory controls has led to shortages on sales orders, creating backorders and unhappy schools.<br>\u2022 Inventory is ordered quarterly due to the seasonality of the business.<br>\u2022 Items can change annually based on popular sizes, colors, and styles for each new school season. The creation of the different configurations is a manual process, which creates so much overhead that temporary workers are brought in to do the data entry.<br><br><br>Current environment. Purchasing -<br><br>\u2022 Reordering is manually managed by the buyers looking at the seasonal spikes for the start of the school year, slowing around the end-of-year holidays until the following school year.<br>\u2022 Pens are readily available products that are rarely discounted for sale.<br>\u2022 Photocopiers are only available for sale on the Glasgow region.<br>\u2022 Photocopy paper and construction paper are ordered by the pallet into Dublin1 and must be broken down into smaller sizes. The pallets are typically broken down and then split between what stays in Dublin1 and what is shipped to Glasgow1.<br>\u2022 Chalk and blackboards are slower sellers, so many vendors do not carry these items. School of Fine Art purchases these products from a single vendor. There are no alternative vendors available.<br>\u2022 School of Fine Art agrees to purchase a new line of smartboards from a vendor. The agreed-upon smartboard purchase prices will have a cost price per 55-inch, 75-inch, or 85-inch smartboard.<br>\u2022 The company purchases pencils for the following warehouses:<br>\u25cb Glasgow1:<br>\u2022 standard pencils from Vendor A<br>\u2022 colored pencils from Vendor B<br>\u25cb Dublin1:<br>\u2022 standard pencils from Vendor A<br>\u2022 colored pencils from Vendor A<br>\u2022 As whiteboard paint grows in popularity, so does the demand. This causes supply shortages. Whiteboard paint is ordered six months in advance.<br><br>Current environment. Customer sales<br><br>\u2022 The company contractually agrees to prices for some items with schools prior to the start of each school year.<br>\u2022 Schools may order bulk cases of products and choose to distribute further breakdowns, such as a case of crayons, which are then distributed to classrooms by the box.<br>\u2022 Pens do not require contracts with schools because they are low margin and do not have supply chain shortages.<br>\u2022 Painting supplies such as acrylic paint, canvases, and easels do not require a special contract and are sold at regular list price to all schools.<br>\u2022 Schools that offer painting classes are part of a program that provides special pricing on the painting supplies.<br>\u2022 Chalk and blackboards are ordered less frequently than they were in past years. Schools are choosing to use whiteboard paint, which is a lower cost than ordering and installing the whiteboards.<br><br>Requirements. Customers and sales<br><br>\u2022 The system must have the ability to limit product purchase amounts by a single school to prevent stock shortages for other schools.<br>\u2022 Schools are obligated to purchase the agreed amount for specific items per the school year.<br>\u2022 Customer service must be able to easily enter items for sales orders and identify stock shortages.<br>\u2022 Sales of whiteboard paint must be limited so that one school does not buy all the inventory and force backorders for other schools.<br>\u2022 Schools must agree to the amount of whiteboard paint they will purchase for the whole school year.<br><br><br>Requirements. Inventory costing -<br><br>\u2022 Inventory must have associated costs except for the vendor storage in Glasgow2.<br>\u2022 The vendor storage must still contain quantities but not include cost in inventory valuations.<br>\u2022 At the end of each month, the costing manager must be able to identify how many items will not be fully settled.<br>\u2022 Annual configuration changes to items must be automatically created where possible.<br>\u2022 The company must be able to track costs for colored pencils and standard pencils separately.<br><br><br>Requirements. Inventory -<br><br>\u2022 Warehouse workers must be able to use their mobile phones and the mobile app to take calls and create transactions in the warehouse.<br>\u2022 The desks must use a single item number and barcode regardless of year manufactured and the vendor.<br>\u2022 Water-based paints from the vendor must be received in pails.<br>\u2022 Acrylic paint must be managed by batches and expiration dates.<br>\u2022 Pencils must be categorized as colored pencils or standard pencils. The individual colors of each colored pencil (such as red, green, and blue) will not be tracked.<br>\u2022 The creation of unique smartboard items must be kept to a minimum.<br><br><br>Issues -<br><br>\u2022 WarehouseWorker1 works in Glasgow2. The worker receives a request to ship pallets of paper from the warehouse to Glasgow1 and Dublin1. WarehouseWorker1 must create the shipments in the system to transfer the pallets of paper from Glasgow1 to Dublin1.<br>\u2022 The number of backorders for desks has increased. Customer service representatives struggle to select a desk item number that has inventory on hand. The desks are the same item, but the manufacturer vendor and year differ.<br>\u2022 A school calls customer service to report that its photocopier is broken. The school needs expedited shipment of a replacement.<br>\u2022 A school that is part of the special paint program reports that a sale price on canvas last month was a better price than its paint program price. The school requests a price adjustment.<br>\u2022 A school reports that different shipments of acrylic paints are slightly different in color.<br>\u2022 The sales team decides to have a flash sale on pens for one month only. The person entering the Sales order line should be able to communicate the information to the customer on the Sales order line.<br>\u2022 Schools are reporting that chalk and blackboards are broken upon receipt. A worker in Dublin1 opens some cases of these products in the warehouse and finds that they are also broken. You must implement processes to enforce inventory inspection for a percentage of each purchase order line received. You must block all inventory for a purchase order line if the inspection fails.<br><br><br>You need to configure the whiteboard paint requirements for schools.<br><br>Which two settings should you configure?

Coho Vineyard is based in Medford, Oregon. The vineyard grows the grapes and then produces and bottles the wine. Coho Winery, based in Grants Pass, Oregon, distributes packaged wine to businesses and consumers. The winery sells imported cheese and olive oil in addition to the wines.<br><br>Current environment. Technology landscape<br><br>\u2022\tCoho Vineyard &amp; Winery requires financial reporting from both Coho Vineyard and Coho Winery. The parent company consolidates financials in a third-party tool.<br>\u2022\tCoho Winery currently manages inventory and financials on spreadsheets separately from the parent company.<br><br>Current environment. Inventory and warehousing<br><br>\u2022\tThe entire warehouse is temperature controlled. A refrigerated section of the warehouse is used for items that require colder storage.<br>\u2022\tThe items do not have fixed locations in the warehouse.<br>\u2022\tCoho uses smart numbering for cheese items today. The items start with F for France and U for United States such as the following:<br>\u2022\tF11234 = French cheese<br>\u2022\tU14567 = US cheese<br>\u2022\tCurrently, wine does not use smart numbering.<br>\u2022\tInventory is valued at First In, First-Out (FIFO).<br>\u2022\tOlive oil has a 12-month shelf life.<br>\u2022\tWineA is expensive and not regularly stocked in the warehouse.<br>\u2022\tWineB must be in the refrigerated section of the warehouse.<br>\u2022\tWineC is non-refrigerated wine and is the majority of inventory in the warehouse.<br><br>Current environment. Vendors and procurement<br><br>\u2022\tCheese is purchased from vendors in two countries: France and United States.<br>\u2022\tNon-cheese items can be purchased from vendors in other countries or regions.<br>\u2022\tOlive oil is bought and sold in full cases of six each.<br>\u2022\tWhen Coho Vineyard produces more wine than expected in a season, rebate programs are offered to any company whose monthly purchases exceed $5,000.<br><br><br>Requirements. General<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tThe Coho Vineyard &amp; Winery parent company, as well as Coho Vineyard, will not be considered in the implementation of Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management for Coho Winery. They plan to implement them as separate legal entities in the next five years.<br><br>Requirements. Inventory and warehousing<br><br>\u2022\tItems must be renumbered in the new system.<br>\u2022\tSeparate item numbers must be used for each imported item for use in simplified reporting by source country or region.<br>\u2022\tAdvanced Warehouse Management capabilities must be enabled in the new system.<br>\u2022\tEach bottle of wine has a single item number.<br>\u2022\tThe vintage of each bottle will change annually and may affect the cost of the bottle. This cost must be tracked by year.<br>\u2022\tSome bottles of wine require refrigeration. The system must automatically define where items must be stored in the warehouse.<br>\u2022\tWine must be grouped in a hierarchy such as the following:<br>\u2022\tRed<br>\u2022\tCabernet<br>\u2022\tMerlot<br>\u2022\tWhite<br>\u2022\tChardonnay<br>\u2022\tPinot<br>\u2022\tInventory value must be stored at each month end.<br>\u2022\tEach month, the olive oil on-hand inventory is evaluated. Anything with less than six months left on the shelf life is sold to a discount retail store. If less than 90 days remains for the shelf life, then the olive oil is donated or destroyed.<br>\u2022\tAt least 20 cases of olive oil and no more than 50 cases are on hand and not reserved for upcoming customer orders.<br>\u2022\tWineB must be refrigerated.<br><br>Requirements. Vendors and procurement<br><br>\u2022\tThe cheese smart numbering system will not be used in the future. Instead, the system must use standard configurations to ensure the correct cheese items are used for the correct country or region when ordering.<br>\u2022\tOlive oil must be managed in full cases only, although the inventory cost must be calculated as cages.<br>\u2022\tShould any bottle of olive oil be broken within a case, the cases will be sold at a discounted price.<br>\u2022\tVendor rebates must be calculated and submitted for a claim.<br>\u2022\tRebate programs are passed on to the retailers selling Coho Winery wines. The rebates must be claimed from Coho Vineyard.<br>\u2022\tPurchase orders (POs) must be maintained online with tracked changes between the vendors and the buyers.<br>\u2022\tThe controller decides WineA must not be held in financial inventory on the Coho Winery books. The winery makes an agreement with the vendor that WineA will be owned by the vendor until a later date.<br>\u2022\tVendor1 sends bulk shipments. Coho Winery does not always have enough warehouse staff to receive inventory. The company requires Vendor1 to send advanced shipping notices (ASNs).<br>\u2022\tThe operations coordinator must schedule inbound loads. The company requires automation of inbound load creation where possible.<br><br><br>Issues<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tThe warehouse is at maximum capacity. Empty bin locations are not always available.<br>\u2022\tThe warehouse manager wants to establish fast moving locations for WineB on the floor and refill locations from higher rack storage.<br>\u2022\tCoho Winery recently conducted an internal audit risk assessment. The risk assessment found that inventory value reports were stored in spreadsheets. The spreadsheets can easily be edited and lack controls.<br>\u2022\tAfter olive oil is counted, multiple cases are destroyed due to shelf life. The inventory planner must determine if a new PO should be placed for olive oil.<br>\u2022\tThe vendor rebates claims are often rejected because the claims were miscalculated by not including discounts.<br>\u2022\tThe purchasing manager receives multiple complaints regarding POs:<br>\u2022\tIssue 1: PO changes are not accepted and confirmed, resulting in out-of-stock issues.<br>\u2022\tIssue 2: Vendors do not have control on responses to POs. Instead, the vendors rely on emails.<br><br><br>You need to enable the system to correctly calculate vendor claims.<br><br>Which configurations should you use for the rebates? To answer, move the appropriate configurations to the correct requirements. You may use each configuration once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to move the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.<br><br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br><br><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-330/image133.png\">",
