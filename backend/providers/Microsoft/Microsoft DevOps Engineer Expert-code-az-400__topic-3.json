The logic app can use the HTTPWebhook trigger to provide the webhook URL and receive the alert payload from the availability test. Then, the logic app can use other actions to handle the email and follow up actions. An HTTP trigger, on the other hand, is used to start a logic app when it receives an HTTP request from any source. A Request trigger is used to start a logic app when it receives a request from another logic app or a Power Automate flow. An ApiConnection trigger is used to start a logic app when it connects to an API, such as Office 365 or Dropbox.

This extension used in your code checks the response of a Vm Scale Set sizing instance. When one of the instances to be scheduled does not respond through the configured TCP port, it will have the status of Unhealthy. If you need an autoscale and it doesn't respond, this extension can perform automatic repairs for that instance. Example JSON code from a REST API. It also runs on Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI 2.0."

This health status is used by Azure to initiate repairs on unhealthy instances and to determine if an instance is eligible for upgrade operations.\n\nThe extension reports health from within a VM and can be used in situations where an external probe such as the Azure Load Balancer health probes can\u2019t be used.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-health-extension?tabs=rest-api"

This means that the test will check for the availability and accessibility of the web page content, and not for the availability of the server or the network connection.

Flaky test data for both passed and failed test is available in Test results. The Flaky tag helps you identify flaky tests. By default, flaky tests are included in the Test Summary. However, if you want to ensure flaky test failures don't fail your pipeline, you can choose to not include them in your test summary and suppress the test failure. This option ensures flaky tests (both passed and failed) are removed from the pass percentage and shown in Tests not reported."

It offers enhanced security features like code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review. Therefore, purchasing a GitHub Advanced Security license would be the appropriate first step to enable push protection for secret scanning in a GitHub Enterprise account."
