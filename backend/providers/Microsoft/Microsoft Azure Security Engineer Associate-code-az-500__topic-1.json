However, it does not configure routing rules to direct traffic to the service endpoint.\nTo meet the goal, you need to perform the following:\n1. Install the Azure CLI on the Ubuntu VM\n2. Install Docker on the VM\n3. Restart the Docker service to pick up the environment variables\n4. Add routing rules to direct traffic from containers to the subnet's service endpoint\n5. Deploy containers and test access to Storage/SQL DB.\nSo in summary, installing the CNI plug-in alone will not configure the network routing needed for the containers to utilize the service endpoint.

When using Azure Container Registry (ACR) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you need to establish an authentication mechanism.

The AKS to ACR integration assigns the AcrPull role to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) managed identity associated with the agent pool in your AKS cluster1. This is essentially creating an Azure AD role assignment. So, your solution of creating an Azure AD role assignment is correct. However, please note that there\u2019s a latency issue with Azure Active Directory groups when attaching ACR1.

The actual names of these fields can vary depending on how the data is structured in your specific Azure Log Analytics workspace.\n\nOption C, \"The EventID and Count() parameters,\" is the closest to what you need, but it's important to use the correct KQL syntax and structure the query properly.

For example, count(*) would count all records in a table.\nThe countif() function, on the other hand, applies a condition to the count operation. It counts the number of records that match a specific condition, specified using a Boolean expression. For example, countif(Severity == 'Error') would count the number of records where the severity is 'Error'.\nIn summary, the count() function counts all records, while the countif() function counts only the records that match a specified condition."
