You also need to ensure that any Windows device that is joined or registered to Azure AD will automatically be enrolled into Intune. You have also been asked to ensure that members of the Sales group are restricted from enrolling personal Android and iOS devices into Intune and that the Enrollment Device Limit is increased to 10 devices. Finally, you need to configure Allan Deyoung as a Device enrollment manager to allow him to enroll 1000 devices."
