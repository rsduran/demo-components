    "answerDescription": "D: You can gradually roll out Seamless SSO to your users. You start by adding the following Azure AD URL to all or selected users' Intranet zone settings by using<br>Group Policy in Active Directory: https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com<br>E: Seamless SSO works with any method of cloud authentication - Password Hash Synchronization or Pass-through Authentication, and can be enabled via Azure<br>AD Connect.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>A: Seamless SSO is not applicable to Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).<br>B: Azure AD connect does not port 8080. It uses port 443.<br>C: Seamless SSO needs the user's device to be domain-joined, but doesn't need for the device to be Azure AD Joined.<br>Scenario: Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.<br>Planned Azure AD Infrastructure include: The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso-quick-start",
