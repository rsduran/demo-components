The Detect API detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. It also returns a unique ID that represents the stored face data. This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses."

This machine learning technique can be applied to binary and multi-class scenarios. For example, a health clinic might use the characteristics of a patient (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to predict whether the patient is at risk of diabetes. In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a binary classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic."

For the third sentence:\nAccuracy is a commonly used metric, especially in binary classification problems, where it measures the percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total.

For example, in medical diagnostics, sensitivity and specificity (true positive rate and true negative rate) may be more relevant metrics to measure the model's ability to correctly identify positives and negatives. In regression problems, metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) are often used.\n\nOther factors, such as precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and others, are commonly used metrics depending on the problem and the desired evaluation criteria.

The trained model can then be used to make predictions.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>\u2711 Classification is a machine learning method that uses data to determine the category, type, or class of an item or row of data.<br>\u2711 Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation.<br>Over the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-module-reference/linear-regression https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/machine-learning-initialize-model-clustering",

Automated ML performs model validation as part of training. That is, automated ML uses validation data to tune model hyperparameters based on the applied algorithm to find the best combination that best fits the training data. However, the same validation data is used for each iteration of tuning, which introduces model evaluation bias since the model continues to improve and fit to the validation data.\n\nTo help confirm that such bias isn't applied to the final recommended model, automated ML supports the use of test data to evaluate the final model that automated ML recommends at the end of your experiment. When you provide test data as part of your AutoML experiment configuration, this recommended model is tested by default at the end of your experiment (preview)."

The trained model can then be used to make predictions.<br><br>Box 2: Clustering -<br>Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation.<br>Over the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.<br><br>Box 3: Classification -<br>Two-class classification provides the answer to simple two-choice questions such as Yes/No or True/False.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/linear-regression",

For example, if a model classifies an image as a dog with a confidence of 0.85, it means the model is 85% confident that the image is correctly classified as a dog.\n\nOn the other hand, accuracy is a metric that measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.

For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects together with their coordinates in the image. You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same tag in an image.<br>The Detect API applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the image. There is currently no formal relationship between the tagging taxonomy and the object detection taxonomy. At a conceptual level, the Detect API only finds objects and living things, while the Tag API can also include contextual terms like \"indoor\", which can't be localized with bounding boxes.<br>Reference:<br>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-object-detection",

    "answerDescription": "Azure Custom Vision is a cognitive service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image classifiers. An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels to apply.<br>Note: The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. You, the developer, must submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according to the needs of your app. You can also export the model itself for offline use.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>Computer Vision:<br>Azure's Computer Vision service provides developers with access to advanced algorithms that process images and return information based on the visual features you're interested in. For example, Computer Vision can determine whether an image contains adult content, find specific brands or objects, or find human faces.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/home",

It is used to generate text that is similar to the input text. For example, given the text \u201cThe cat sat on the\u201d, a language model would predict that the next word is \u201cmat\u201d with a higher probability than \u201ccar\u201d.\n\nSince we are talking about a smart device, the answer will be key phrase detection.\n\nUpvote me it makes sense to you."

This could allow the AI to understand the users' intent and respond appropriately.\nKey phrase extraction could also work but is more complex because an additional layer would have to be added that understands user intent based on the combination of keywords extracted. But it would become complex and probably less efficient as well. Language modeling solves this problem natively."

This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses."

The AI's analysis can then provide feedback to the photographer to improve the composition and settings, resulting in better photographs. While this specific example focuses on photo quality aspects, facial analysis may also involve analyzing and detecting faces within images, recognizing facial expressions, emotions, or attributes, but that doesn't seem to be the focus in this particular case."

This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses."

Key Phrase Extraction: To identify and extract the main topics or themes from the manuscript content.\nSo, the correct answer is C. translation and key phrase extraction. Please note that depending on the specific requirements of the solution, other NLP tasks could also be relevant. For example, entity recognition could be used to identify specific entities within the text, and sentiment analysis could be used to understand the tone or sentiment of the manuscript.
