The question is not asking whether a business rule can be used to set a value, but whether a business rule with a scope of entity can be used to automatically mark the candidate for follow up. The scope of entity means that the business rule will apply to all forms and views of the data entity, not just the one used by the HR representatives for the job candidates. This could cause problems for the other app that is used for internal employees and promotions, which might have different criteria or logic for follow up. Therefore, the solution does not meet the goal.\n\nA better solution would be to use a business rule with a scope of specific form and select the form that is used by the HR representatives for the job candidates. This way, the business rule will only run on that form and not affect the other app. You can learn more about creating business rules and setting their scope from [this article].\n\nI hope this helps you understand why B is the correct answer."

A PowerQuery is a way to transform and analyze data from various sources by using a query language. A Common Data Service workflow with a PowerQuery cannot be used to automatically mark the candidate for follow up in the Power Apps app. A better solution would be to use a formula in the Power Apps app that sets the value of the follow-up checkbox based on the entered data. For example, you could use something like this:\n\nIf(Or(Degree = \u201cBachelor\u2019s\u201d, First available hire date &lt;= Today() + 30, Initial impression &gt;= 7), true, false)\n\nThis formula checks the criteria and sets the follow-up checkbox accordingly.

It allows the app to adapt and adjust its user interface dynamically based on the device it is running on. This ensures that the app will render properly on different devices, including tablets and phones, as it does not lock the layout to a fixed screen size.\n\nAspect ratio\n\nExplanation: \"Aspect ratio\" refers to the proportional relationship between the width and height of the screen or display. By designing the app to a specific aspect ratio, you ensure that it will always maintain the same proportional layout regardless of the device's screen size. This is useful when you need the app to display consistently and not stretch or distort the user interface on different devices with varying resolutions.\n\nBy using a blank canvas app (no specific screen size) and locking the app to a specific aspect ratio, you ensure that the new app will render properly on all devices, including tablets and phones. It allows for a flexible layout while maintaining a consistent proportion for a better user experience."

This trigger allows you to specify the site address and the list name as inputs. In this scenario, this trigger is suitable because it can monitor the SharePoint list that contains the bylaw proposals and start the flow whenever there is a new or modified proposal.\n\n- The action \"Post an adaptive card to a channel and wait for a response\" is used when you want to send an interactive message to a channel in Teams, where users can provide input and submit their response. An adaptive card is a customizable card that can contain text, images, buttons, inputs, etc. This action allows you to specify the team name, the channel name, and the adaptive card JSON as inputs. In this scenario, this action is suitable because it can send the bylaw proposal information to the inspectors in Teams, where they can vote and provide feedback using the adaptive card buttons and inputs."

Use a formula to populate a table when the app starts.\n\nThis is because a collection is a type of data source that is local to the app and does not require a connection to a cloud service. You can create a collection with the ClearCollect function when the app starts and use it as a data source for your controls. This way, the data will be available before user interaction and only to the app.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Using the Excel Online connector to retrieve the data would require an internet connection and a cloud service, which are not necessary for a small amount of tabular data that is only available to the app.\nB. Reading the data from a file on the device would require user interaction to select the file and load the data, which is not desirable for this scenario.\nD.
