Threat indicators are data that associate observed artifacts such as URLs, file hashes, or IP addresses with known threat activity such as phishing, botnets, or malware. This form of threat intelligence is often called tactical threat intelligence because it's' applied to security products and automation in large scale to detect potential threats to an organization and protect against them. Use threat indicators in Microsoft Sentinel, to detect malicious activity observed in your environment and provide context to security investigators to inform response decisions."

This effectively prevents any new applications or users from obtaining and using access keys to access the storage resources. However, existing applications that are already using access keys will continue to function normally unless you update their authentication mechanism to use alternatives such as Azure AD authentication or managed identities. This approach enhances security by limiting the use of access keys, which are considered sensitive credentials, and encourages the adoption of more secure authentication methods."

This can help you ensure that only authorized users are able to access the web apps, and that their access is secure. Additionally, Azure AD Application Proxy simplifies the end-user experience by providing a single sign-on (SSO) experience for the users, which can reduce the need for them to remember multiple usernames and passwords.\n\nOther options, such as web content filtering in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Tunnel, or Azure Virtual WAN, may not be as suitable for this scenario because they do not provide the same level of control over access to the internal web apps or the same level of simplicity for the end-user experience."

It allows you to use your Azure AD directory as a managed domain without the need to set up, maintain, and secure an on-premises domain controller. This can help reduce the administrative effort required to maintain the infrastructure and ensure that the legacy applications continue to function as expected.\n\nOther identity services, such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, may not be as suitable for this scenario because they do not provide the same level of support for legacy applications that rely on LDAP and Kerberos-based authentication. Similarly, using an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) instance would require maintaining additional infrastructure and may not be as cost-effective or efficient as using a managed service like Azure AD DS."

When using Azure SQL Database, you pay-as-you-go, with the option to scale up or out with no service interruption.\n\nWithin Azure SQL Database, you have the option to deploy a managed instance. Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is a collection of system and user databases with a shared set of resources. In addition to all the PaaS benefits of Azure SQL Database, this option provides a native virtual network (VNet) and near 100 percent compatibility with on-premises SQL Server. Azure SQL Database Managed Instance provides you with full SQL Server access and feature compatibility for migrating SQL Servers to Azure.\n\nRecommendation: Choose Azure SQL Database for your modern cloud applications, or when you have time constraints in development and marketing."

Commit the code\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/devsecops-controls#commit-the-code\nTypically, developers create, manage, and share their code in repositories such as GitHub or Azure Repos. This approach provides a central, version-controlled library of code for developers to collaborate on easily. However, enabling many collaborators on a single codebase also runs the risk of changes being introduced. That risk can lead to vulnerabilities or unintentionally including credentials or tokens in commits.\n\nTo address this risk, development teams should evaluate and implement a repository scanning capability. Repository scanning tools perform static code analysis on source code within repositories. The tools look for vulnerabilities or credentials changes and flag any items found for remediation. This capability acts to protect against human error and is a useful safeguard for distributed teams where many people are collaborating in the same repository."

An on-premises Syslog server\n\nSetting up an on-premises Syslog server is a common approach for collecting and forwarding logs from various devices, including firewalls, to a central location for further processing and analysis. You can configure the Syslog server to receive logs in the Common Event Format (CEF) from your firewalls and then forward those logs to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. Microsoft Sentinel has built-in support for Syslog, making it a suitable choice for this scenario."
