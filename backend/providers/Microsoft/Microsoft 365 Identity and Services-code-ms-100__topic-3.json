Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity Protection policies\" because it specifically mentions \"something unusual about this sign-in\" which suggests that the issue is related to sign-in activity and authentication. Azure AD conditional access policies can be used to define policies that control how and when users can access resources, including sign-in policies. These policies can be configured to block access if certain conditions are not met, such as sign-ins from unknown locations or devices, which could trigger the message described in the question. Azure AD Identity Protection policies, on the other hand, focus more on detecting and responding to identity-based threats, such as password spray attacks or brute-force attacks, and may not be directly related to the sign-in issue described in the question."

When the password expires or when User1 (or an administrator) changes the password, the password will be evaluated and will have to meet the password requirements.<br><br>Box 2: Yes -<br>Password evaluation goes through several steps including normalization and Substring matching which is used on the normalized password to check for the user's first and last name as well as the tenant name. Normalization is the process of converting common letter substitutes into letters.  For example, 0 converts to o. $ converts to s. etc.<br>The next step is to identify all instances of banned passwords in the user's normalized new password. Then:<br>1. Each banned password that is found in a user's password is given one point.<br>2. Each remaining unique character is given one point.<br>3. A password must be at least five (5) points for it to be accepted.<br>'C0nt0s0' becomes 'contoso' after normalization.  Therefore, C0nt0s0_C0mplex123 contains one instance of the banned password (contoso) so that equals 1 point.  After 'contoso', there are 11 unique characters.  Therefore, the score for 'C0nt0s0_C0mplex123' is 12.  This is more than the required 5 points so the password is acceptable.<br>Box 3:<br>The 'Password protection for Windows Server Active Directory' is in 'Audit' mode.  This means that the password protection rules are not applied.  Audit mode is for logging policy violations before putting the password protection 'live' by changing the mode to 'enforced'.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad",

Once a password is accepted by Active Directory, only authentication-protocol-specific hashes of that password are persisted. The clear-text password is never persisted, therefore Azure AD Password Protection cannot validate existing passwords.\n\nAfter initial deployment of Azure AD Password Protection, all users and accounts will eventually start using an Azure AD Password Protection-validated password as their existing passwords expire normally over time.

    "answerDescription": "There's a 1:1 relationship between an Azure AD Connect sync server and an Azure AD tenant. For each Azure AD tenant, you need one Azure AD Connect sync server installation.<br>Therefore, we need to deploy two servers that run Azure AD Connect for the two Azure AD tenants.<br>Each user account can only be synchronized to one Azure AD tenant.  Therefore, we need a way of splitting the users between the two Azure AD tenants.  Azure<br>AD Connect offers three ways to filter which users get synchronized to an Azure AD tenant. You can use domain-based filtering if you have multiple domains in a forest, attribute-based filtering or OU-based filtering.<br>Note:<br>Other incorrect answers for this question include:<br>1. Deploy one server that runs Azure AD Connect, and then filter the users for each tenant by using attribute-based filtering.<br>2.
