For example, the ExpressRoute/VPN Gateway coexist configuration requires a larger gateway subnet than most other configurations. Further more, you may want to make sure your gateway subnet contains enough IP addresses to accommodate possible future configurations. While you can create a gateway subnet as small as /29, we recommend that you create a gateway subnet of /27 or larger (/27, /26 etc.). If you plan on connecting 16 ExpressRoute circuits to your gateway, you must create a gateway subnet of /26 or larger. If you're creating a dual stack gateway subnet, we recommend that you also use an IPv6 range of /64 or larger. This set up will accommodate most configurations.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#gwsub"
