No where it says you have to create a duplicate detection rule :). So option A is out. \nNow based on the options you see in the Duplicate Detection Settings, option D is also out as you don't want to turn the DD completely off. \nB is also out as you want to turn off the DD when the record is manually created or updated.\nSo you are left with option C &amp; E. You want to turn the DD off on manual record creation and turn the DD ON on data import. \nHope this helps."
