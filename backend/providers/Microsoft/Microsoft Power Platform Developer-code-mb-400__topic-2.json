Field-level security is managed by the security profiles. To implement field-level security, a system administrator performs the following tasks.<br>1. Enable field security on one or more fields for a given entity.<br>2. Associate one more existing security profiles, or create one or more new security profiles to grant the appropriate access to specific users or teams.<br>Note: Record-level permissions are granted at the entity level, but you may have certain fields associated with an entity that contain data that is more sensitive than the other fields.

The reason is twofold.\n\n1: The question states that YOU need to CONFIGURE THE SECURITY to meet the requirement.  Saying to users to share a record may work, but this is the user making use of the sharing feature in the application.  It is NOT you configuring the security.\n\n2: There is a security implication with sharing records with users, when the requirement focuses on departments.  What happens if, during the course of an opportunity, a user switches department?  Well, they would still have the record shared with them when they move to the 3rd department, breaking the requirement that only 2 departments would have access.\n\nB is therefore correct."
