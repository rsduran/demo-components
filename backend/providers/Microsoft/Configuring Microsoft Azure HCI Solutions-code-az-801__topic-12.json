        "content": "The question is malformed. You are incorrect about generating the key from dc1.corp.fabrikam.com - the encryption key needs to be generated from the SOURCE domain, effectively ruling out any machine that's in the corp.fabrikam.com domain.\n\nBased on the spirit of the question, I assume the option was supposed to be \"admt.europe.fabrikam.com\" - this would make sense because any ADMT machine would need to exist on the source domain (europe.fabrikam.com), not in the target domain. So by process of elimination, the answer basically NEEDS to be \"admt.fabrikam.com,\" though what they MEANT was \"admt.europe.fabrikam.com\""
