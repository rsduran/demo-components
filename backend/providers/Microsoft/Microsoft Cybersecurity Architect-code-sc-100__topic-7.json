Microsoft's Azure Blueprints are resources to help build and launch cloud-powered applications that comply with stringent regulations and standards. Included in the blueprints are reference architectures, compliance guidance and deployment scripts.<br>An Azure Blueprint is a package for creating specific sets of standards and requirements that govern the implementation of Azure services, security, and design.<br>Such packages are reusable so that consistency and compliance among resources can be maintained.<br>Incorrect:<br>* not Workflow automation<br>Workflow automation is an approach to making the flow of tasks, documents and information across work-related activities perform independently in accordance with defined business rules.<br>Box 2: Modify an Azure policy definition<br>Scenario: The virtual machines in TestRG must be excluded from the compliance assessment.<br>Use a Policy definition to include the TestRG virtual machines from the Blueprint.<br>Note: Azure Policy establishes conventions for resources. Policy definitions describe resource compliance conditions and the effect to take if a condition is met. A condition compares a resource property field or a value to a required value. Resource property fields are accessed by using aliases. When a resource property field is an array, a special array alias can be used to select values from all array members and apply a condition to each one.<br>By defining conventions, you can control costs and more easily manage your resources. For example, you can specify that only certain types of virtual machines are allowed. Or, you can require that resources have a particular tag. Policy assignments are inherited by child resources. If a policy assignment is applied to a resource group, it's applicable to all the resources in that resource group.<br>Incorrect:<br>* Not Update a policy assignment<br>A policy assignment assigns a Blueprint to a subscription. The scope is at the subscription level.<br>Note: Policy Assignments provide a means for applying policy to a subscription to which a blueprint is assigned.  That said, the policy must be within the scope of the blueprint containing the policy. Parameters defined with a policy are assigned during blueprint creation or during blueprint assignment.<br>Reference:<br>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-releases-automation-for-hipaa-hitrust-compliance/ https://cloudacademy.com/blog/what-are-azure-blueprints/ https://k21academy.com/microsoft-azure/azure-rbac-vs-azure-policies-vs-azure-blueprints/",
