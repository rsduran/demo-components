Now let's check NSG2: it is tied to [vnet1/subnet2] so it applies to VM2. NSG2 is blocking RDP connection attempts orignitated form the whole VNET1 (10.0.0.0/16 includes the following range: 10.0.0.0--&gt;10.0.255.255) so RDP packet will never reach VM2."

Establish peering between VNET1 and VNET3.\n\nTo ensure that VM1 can communicate with VM4, we need to establish connectivity between the two virtual networks (VNET1 and VNET3) where the VMs reside. VNet peering enables us to connect two virtual networks together so that VMs in either network can communicate with each other. With VNet peering, the virtual networks are connected directly using the Azure backbone network, so we do not need to create any user-defined routes or assign specific IP addresses to VMs. Additionally, peering reduces administrative effort by eliminating the need for complex network configurations."
