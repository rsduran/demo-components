Answer for metric should be Azure Monitor as it does display metric for Azure VM at least. \n2. There is no doubt functionality can be monitored in Azure Monitor (however this has as well limitations)\n3. Security in Azure Infra can be seen from Azure Security Center. Since that is not an option here I will go with Log Analytics and not with Azure Monitor (as Azure Monitor is not meant to track security alert). Hence, there is a doubt that probably this is an old question. \n\nPlease see link below for more details: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/monitor-reference"

Features in Log Analytics and Application Insights have not changed, although some features have been rebranded to Azure Monitor in order to better reflect their new scope. The log data engine and query language of Log Analytics is now referred to as Azure Monitor Logs. See Azure Monitor terminology updates.\""

You can interact with the metrics in several ways, including charting them in Azure portal, accessing them through the REST API, or querying them using PowerShell or CLI. Azure Monitor also offers its data directly into Log Analytics and other services, where you can query and combine it with data from other sources on premises or in the cloud. Box2- Azure Log Analytics- helps correlate the usage and performance data collected by Application Insights with configuration and performance data across the Azure resources that support the app. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/app-service-web-app/app-monitoring  Box3-Security Center uses the Log Analytics agent to collect and store data. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/faq-general"
