    "answerDescription": "Box 1: Webhook -<br>With Dataverse, you can send data about events that occur on the service to a web app by using webhooks. A webhook is a lightweight HTTP pattern for connecting web APIs and services with a publish-and-subscribe model. Webhook senders notify receivers about events by making requests to receiver endpoints with some information about the events.<br>Webhooks enable developers and ISVs to integrate Dataverse data with their own custom code hosted on external services.<br><br>Box 2: Azure Service Bus -<br>Service Bus provides a secure and reliable communication channel between Dataverse runtime data and external, cloud-based line-of-business apps. This capability is especially useful in keeping disparate Dataverse systems or other Dataverse servers synchronized with business data changes.<br><br>Box 3: Azure Event hub -<br>Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored by using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.<br>Note: The most popular approaches in Dataverse involve webhooks, Azure messaging (Service Bus, Event Hubs), Azure Logic Apps, or Power Automate.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/why-cds-any-type-app",

Azure Service bus \n- Azure Service Bus works for high scale processing, and provides a full queueing mechanism if Common Data Service is pushing many events. Webhook can only scale to the point at which your hosted web service can handle the messages. \n3. Azure Event Hub \n- They want a hybrid.

If ReceiveAndDelete mode is used, the message will be deleted from the queue as soon as it is read, regardless of whether it is processed successfully or not.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that the message queue is cleared properly when a message is read, you should use the ReceiveAndDelete mode of the QueueClient or SubscriptionClient class, rather than the BrokeredMessage class as I previously mentioned.\n\nThe correct answer is not B.

The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br><br>Environment<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tThe company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.<br>\u2022\tEach environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.<br>\u2022\tThe company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.<br><br><br>Data<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tResearchers are responsible for creating account records.<br>\u2022\tResearchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.<br>\u2022\tA synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.<br>\u2022\tUsers must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.<br>\u2022\tA column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.<br>\u2022\tResearchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.<br><br><br>Web API<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tThe company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.<br>\u2022\tData can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].<br>\u2022\t[ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.<br>\u2022\t[DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.<br>\u2022\tThe Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.<br>\u2022\tDevelopers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.<br><br><br>Requirements<br> -<br><br><br>Custom connector<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tThe Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.<br>\u2022\tThe URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.<br>\u2022\tErrors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.<br>\u2022\tText descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.<br><br><br>Process<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tAll account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.<br>\u2022\tOnly account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.<br>\u2022\tResearchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.<br>\u2022\tThe researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.<br><br><br>Issues<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tA tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.<br>\u2022\tA missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.<br><br><br>You need to configure a Power Automate flow to update account records by using the response from the Web API.<br><br>Which three actions should you perform in sequence?
