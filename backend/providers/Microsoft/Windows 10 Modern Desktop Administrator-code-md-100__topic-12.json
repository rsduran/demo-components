They can still see what's linked though, so they can use the Group Policy Editor to view all GPO's that should be applied.\n\nAnd that's where I'm in doubt, because they can see which policies SHOULD be applied, but not what's actually applied to a specific computer. However, Get-GPOReport also doesn't do this. The requirement states the following:\n\n\"Helpdesk users must be able to troubleshoot Group Policy object (GPO) processing on the Windows 10 computers. The helpdesk users must be able to identify which Group Policies are applied to the computers.\"\n\nThey'd need local administrator rights and GPResult to see what's actually applied. For the computer at least, since administrators are often excluded from user policies.\n\nTricky question...
