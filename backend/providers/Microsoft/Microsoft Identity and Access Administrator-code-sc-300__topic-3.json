The question didn't open teh door/option to use external FW service. In MPOV, it's teh Azure monitor that can used to collect logs from teh existing FW and anlysed to acheive teh requesed outcome. Have a look at this link:\nCan Azure Monitor also monitor on-premises resources?\nYes. In addition to collecting monitoring data from Azure resources, Azure Monitor can collect data from virtual machines and applications in other clouds and on-premises. See Sources of monitoring data for Azure Monitor.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/faq\n\nMy suggested answer is\" Azure Monitor\""

By default, all the applications a user can access are listed together on a single page. To better organize this page for your users, if you have an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license you can set up collections. With a collection, you can group together applications that are related (for example, by job role, task, or project) and display them on a separate tab.

OAuth app policy.\n\nAn OAuth app policy is a type of policy that allows you to control the permissions and access of third-party apps that use OAuth to connect to your cloud apps, such as Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Salesforce. You can create an OAuth app policy based on various criteria, such as the app name, the permission level, the number of users who authorized the app, and the group memberships of those users. You can also set an alert action for the policy, which will notify you when an app meets the conditions you specified. For example, you can create an OAuth app policy that will alert you when there are apps that require a high permission level and are authorized by more than 20 users1."

When users install these apps, they often click accept without closely reviewing the details in the prompt, including granting permissions to the app. This problem is compounded by the fact that IT may not have enough insight to weigh the security risk of an application against the productivity benefit that it provides. Because accepting third-party app permissions is a potential security risk to your organization, monitoring the app permissions your users' grant gives you the necessary visibility and control to protect your users and your applications."
