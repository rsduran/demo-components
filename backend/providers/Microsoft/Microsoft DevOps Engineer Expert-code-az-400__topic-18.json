One of the parameters of this command is the ConfigurationMode parameter, which specifies the mode in which the configuration should be applied. The ApplyOnly mode is currently being used, which means that the configuration will only be applied, but not checked or corrected. To resolve the current technical issue, the ConfigurationMode parameter should be changed to ApplyAndAutoCorrect, which will apply the configuration and also check and correct any drift.
