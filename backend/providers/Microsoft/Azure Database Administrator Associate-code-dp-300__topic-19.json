There are 2 different compute tiers: Provisioned and Serverless. While the provisioned compute tier provides a specific amount of compute resources that are continuously provisioned independent of workload activity, the serverless compute tier auto-scales compute resources based on workload activity.\n\nThe answer is clearly serverless unless whoever wrote this question does not know the difference between service tier and compute tier.\n\nThank you for listening!"

Serverless compute automatically scales resources based on usage and pauses during idle periods, helping to optimize cost and resource allocation for databases that experience irregular load patterns.\nThe other tiers (Business Critical, Hyperscale, and General Purpose) are more suited for workloads that have consistent or high resource demands but may not fit well in scenarios with fluctuating demand, as seen in the usage chart."

But definitely it is an interesting question since it checks how deep we understand the difference between the service tier / computer tier and their capabilities.\nThe question is which compute tier should you use. \nThe Business requirement says - The PaaS solution must provide automatic failover during Azure regional outage.\n\nServerless compute tier comes under Gen. Purpose Service tier which has HA solution where failover happens automatically during node failure or outage.\nThe answer is D"
