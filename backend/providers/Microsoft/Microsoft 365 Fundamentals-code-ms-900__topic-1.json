There's no specific details on what the apps are so we can't assume that none are able to migrate. \n\nI also don't understand why everyone thinks that sensitive information cannot be protected in Azure. There are tons of ways to protect it. On-premise can be a lot more insecure than cloud. It all depends on how you manage your infrastructure.\n\nThe only option that is decent is hardware tokens. There are applications that require hardware tokens for licensing as well not just authentication. Some of those apps don't support usb passthrough. Like someone else mentioned Autocad is a perfect example. Don't get tunnel vision on an answer. Think outside of the box because D and B are not the correct answer that's for sure"

It provides extended support, with updates only for security and critical issues, making it suitable for devices that should only be upgraded after a long period.\n\nConsistency: LTSC editions do not receive bi-annual feature updates like other Windows editions, ensuring that the software environment remains stable and consistent over time.\n\nCost Efficiency: Although initial costs might be higher compared to other editions, the reduced need for frequent upgrades and maintenance over a five-year period can lead to overall cost savings."

When an invoice is submitted, a notification can be sent to the approver in Microsoft Teams, where they can review and approve the invoice.\n\nPower Virtual Agents can be used to create a chatbot that handles invoice approvals by integrating it with Microsoft Teams.

Please check the following source in which the following is specified: Currently, you can assign iOS/iPadOS and Android apps (line-of-business and store-purchased apps) to devices that aren't enrolled with Intune. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-deploy\n\n- Second one: NO. In the same source added above, you can check the table in wich is specified that it supports both enrolled and not enrolled with intune.\n\n- Third one: YES. As above, checking in the table you can see that installing from THE WEB BASED is supported for devices enrolled and not enrolled. This would not be correct if question was about installing app from THE COMPANY PORTAL APP. In this last case you can only do it for devices enrolled with intune.\n\nHope it helps!"

Service-level encryption using customer-provided key: This ensures that data is encrypted when it's at rest or in transit between datacenters. The customer has full control over the encryption keys used to secure their data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it.\n\nD. Data transfer using transport-layer security (TLS): This ensures that data is encrypted when it's in transit between devices and servers. TLS is used to secure data transfer in many protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and FTP. By using TLS, you can protect against eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.\n\nNote that options B and C are not correct because Microsoft Azure AD encryption is not customer-provided and single-tenant infrastructure partitions are not related to data security."

Microsoft Endpoint Manager can deploy operating systems to computers, join them to an on-premises Active Directory domain, and install Windows updates. It can also manage mobile devices and applications. Therefore, Microsoft Endpoint Manager is the best solution for managing Windows 10 computers in this scenario."

Sensitivity labels can also trigger disposition reviews, which are used to determine whether a document should be deleted or retained based on certain criteria. Additionally, sensitivity labels can be configured to automatically apply to documents, reducing the risk of human error in ensuring that sensitive data is properly labeled and protected.

The PAW configuration includes security controls and policies that restrict local administrative access and productivity tools to minimize the attack surface to only what is absolutely required for performing sensitive job tasks. This makes the PAW device difficult for attackers to compromise because it blocks the most common vector for phishing attacks: email and web browsing.<br>D: As shown in the diagram, privileged access management builds on the protection provided with native encryption of Microsoft 365 data and the role-based access control security model of Microsoft 365 services. When used with Azure AD Privileged Identity Management, these two features provide access control with just-in-time access at different scopes.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04260/0028200001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/privileged-access-devices https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/privileged-access-management-overview?view=o365-worldwide",

When you place a user mailbox on Litigation hold, content in the user's archive mailbox (if it's enabled) is also retained. When you create a hold, you can specify a hold duration (also called a time-based hold) so that deleted and modified items are retained for a specified period and then permanently deleted from the mailbox. Or you can just retain content indefinitely (called an infinite hold) or until the Litigation hold is removed.<br>D: In Exchange Online, you can use archive policies to automatically move mailbox items to personal (on-premises) or cloud-based archives. Archive policies are retention tags that use the Move to Archive retention action.<br>You can modify retention tags included in the default policy to meet your business requirements. For example, you can modify the archive DPT to move items to the archive after three years instead of two.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/create-a-litigation-hold?view=o365-worldwide https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/modify-archive-policies",

If they want to move to Azure though, they'd either need a new license, or they could do Hybrid Benefit and use their existing license. Not enough info for this question, imo.\n\nPresumably they would just use Exchange Online now as it's included in 365.\n\n\nSo I say:\n\nWindows 10 Pro = Required\nOffice Professional = Not required\nServer = ???

The second one is asking what product licenses need to be purchased: \"You need to determine which products require the purchase of Microsoft 365 licenses for new employees.\nWhich product licenses should the company purchase?\"\nI think we need to consider the product licenses. Because those products cannot require W365 licenses. In this case it will be more or less clear.\n1. Windows upgrade is not required to purchase as Win10 is part of W365\n2. Office professional. Required as it is not part of W365.\n3. Windows server. Not required as we talk about users. If it would ask for Windows server CAL, then required for on-premise environment. So probably there is an error in the answer area.\n4. Exchange CAL. Required for on-premise environment."

This can include something the user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a smart card), or something the user is (such as a fingerprint). MFA provides an additional layer of security to protect against unauthorized access.\n\nJust-in-time (JIT) access: This solution provides temporary access to resources only when needed. JIT access can be used to grant access to users who require it for a specific task or time period. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and limit the exposure of sensitive data.\n\nBlock legacy authentication: This solution blocks authentication requests that use legacy protocols such as POP, IMAP, and SMTP. Legacy authentication protocols are less secure than modern authentication protocols and can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to resources."

What is SIEM, and how does it differ from SOAR? When should one solution be used over the other?\n\nWhile SOAR tools are primarily used to orchestrate and automate threat response, SIEM offers greater visibility into activity through threat detection, log management, incident analysis, and regulatory and standards compliance. This visibility is achieved by logging and consolidating multiple streams of data from across your network, providing a bird\u2019s-eye view of your organization\u2019s overall security landscape.\n\nThe two systems work best in tandem. SIEM collects and analyzes data, SOAR runs based on that data\u2014forming a complete solution for risk detection, visibility, and response.  Answer: NO, NO, Yes"
