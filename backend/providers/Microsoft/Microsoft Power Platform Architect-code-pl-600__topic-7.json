A user's privileges can come from their individual security roles, those of the teams that they're part of or the ones they inherit. A team has full access rights on the records that the team owns. Team members are added manually to the owner team.<br>Scenario: Employee authentication with the existing system is provided by an on-premises Active Directory instance that is linked to Azure Active Directory.<br>Box 2: Azure Active Directory Security Group Team<br>An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group team. Similar to owner team, an Azure AD group team can own records and can have security roles assigned to the team.<br>Note: The administration of app and data access for Microsoft Dataverse has been extended to allow administrators to use their organization's Azure Active<br>Directory (Azure AD) groups to manage access rights for licensed Dataverse users.<br>Box 3: Azure Active Directory B2B Guest Access<br>An Azure AD B2B collaboration user is an external user, typically from a partner organization, that you invite to sign into your Azure AD organization using their own credentials. This B2B collaboration user (also generally referred to as a guest user) can then access the apps and resources you want to share with them. A user object is created for the B2B collaboration user in the same directory as your employees. B2B collaboration user objects have limited privileges in your directory by default, and they can be managed like employees, added to groups, and so on.<br>Scenario: Before First Up signs a contract to place workers at a client company, a member of the audit team visits the company and interviews company management. Audit members use different types of devices including Android and iOS devices. First Up has no plans to require the use of a single type of device.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/manage-group-teams https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/user-properties",

(potentially the governance audit team is another team than the international auditing team member, the case study is not so clear here)\n\nmy solution is: Governance is internal stuff. and maybe not even related to the international audit team members. therefore: B2B Guest Access is not an option as it is internal staff. \n\n3 D:  Azure Active Directory Security Group Team"
