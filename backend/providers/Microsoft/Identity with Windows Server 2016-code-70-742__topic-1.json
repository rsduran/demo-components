If it is implying that we are trying to nest the Server Operators group from DomainB to the Server Operators group on DomainA, this cannot be done. Server Operators is a builtin Doman Local group. Domain Local groups can have as members only Domain Local groups from the same domain. Since we are working with different forests, the Server Operators group cannot have as members domain local group from other forests. In this scenario the answer would be NO.\n\n2. The wording \"modifying the membership of the Server Operators group on DomainA\" leaves open for the possibility of adding users from other but trusted domains or forests into this group. This task could be accomplished and would work (so the answer would be YES), but this is not the recommended practice. The recommended way is to assign the users from DomanB to a global group on DomainB, than assign this to a universal group on DomainB, and than we can assign this group as a member of the Server Operators group on DomainA.\n\nPersonally, I would go with NO."

The computer name of the computer to be joined by the command djoin /requestODJ must match the name supplied in the switch /machine &lt;destination computer when djoin /provision was first run to provision the computer object in AD. Tech1 has privileges to change the computer name before running djoin /requestODJ, but this isn't mentioned as a step, even though it is crucial. The only instructions for Tech1 mentioned in the question are logon to the laptop and run djoin. As djoin won't automatically rename the computer, this step must be done manually."

You may have to transfer roles to perform operations that affect the FSMO owner. This is especially true for the PDC Emulator role.

HOWEVER this is not indicated in this specific question, therefore, Drive Mappings are assumed to be Inherited from the Domain-Linked GPO.\n\nAnd because this is a GPO Linked to the Domain and not an OU, Item-Level-Targeting, which is configured in the Common Tab of the Drive Maps Properties, would ensure that the specific User Preferences would only apply to Computers within the designated Subnet (IP Range) and not to any other computers, as would be the case using WMI.\n\nThese questions are CRAZY specific...."

This became an issue when trying to accomplish\ncertificate authentication with AD FS prior to AD FS in Windows Server 2016.\nThis is because you could not have different bindings for device authentication and user certificate authentication on the same host\nThe default port 443 is bound to receive device certificates and cannot be altered to support multiple binding in the same channel.\nThe results were that smart card authentication would not work and users were unaware of what happened since there is no indication of what really happened.\nIn AD FS on Windows Server 2016 this has changed. Now we support two modes, the first uses the same host (i.e. adfs.contoso.com) with different\nports (443, 49443).\nThe second used different hosts (adfs.contoso.com and certauth.adfs.contoso.com) with the same port (443).\nThis will require an SSL certificate to support \"certauth.\" as an alternate subject name.

    "answerDescription": "By default, an AD RMS Licensing Server can issue use licenses for only content where it originally issued the publishing license. In some situations, this may not be acceptable. In order to specify a cluster that is allowed to issue use licenses for content protected by a different cluster, the first cluster must be defined as a trusted publishing domain. If content was published by another certification cluster either in your organization, for example, a subsidiary organization in another forest, or in a separate organization, your AD RMS cluster can grant use licenses to users for this content by configuring a Trusted Publishing Domain on your AD<br>RMS cluster. By adding a Trusted Publishing Domain, you set up a trust relationship between your AD RMS cluster and the other certification cluster by importing the Trusted Publishing Certificate of the other cluster.<br>References:<br>https://books.google.co.za/books?id=gjR-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=configure+a+partners+forest+as+a+trusted+publishing+domain+-+AD<br>+RMS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mohQXTyW9s&amp;sig=NJ7oFHuLYOs72o9EM-<br>yQiIscUW8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuivW24sPbAhWGRMAKHQcEB6EQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=configure%20a%20partners%20forest%20as%20a%<br>20trusted%20publishing%20domain%20-%20AD%20RMS&amp;f=false",
