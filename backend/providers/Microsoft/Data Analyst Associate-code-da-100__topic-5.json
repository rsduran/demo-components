Your goal is to make sure that all people in your organization can read (view) one of the dashboards and three of the reports.\n\nThere's a suggestion to use the \"Included in app\" feature. This feature lets you bundle your reports and dashboards together into something called an \"app\" that you can share easily.\n\nThe question is asking whether using the \"Included in app\" feature for everything in the workspace will achieve your goal of letting everyone see the specific dashboard and reports.\n\nSo, the question is: Does enabling \"Included in app\" for everything in the workspace help you make sure that everyone in your organization can view the one dashboard and three reports you want them to see?\n\n\nNow, based on the context and how Power BI apps work, you need to choose whether the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\"."
