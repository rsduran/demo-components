However, if you want to implement limited user testing on the web application running on all virtual machines in the scale set, you would typically use the Custom Script extension or another deployment method to update the code running on all the virtual machines at once, rather than modifying the configuration of each virtual machine individually.\n\n\nI believe A is necessary for Canary testing as we want to test it for just limited number of Users."

By adding this app to your repository, you enable the integration between Azure DevOps (Azure Boards is a part of Azure DevOps) and GitHub.\n\nThis integration allows you to automatically trigger builds and release pipelines in Azure Pipelines based on commits, pull requests, or other events in your GitHub repository.\n\nIt also enables the communication of commit status and build results from Azure Pipelines to Azure Boards, so you can track the status of your work items (such as user stories or tasks) in Azure Boards based on the build and deployment status in Azure Pipelines.\n\nSo, by adding the Azure Pipelines app to your GitHub repository, you establish the link between GitHub and Azure DevOps (which includes Azure Boards), enabling commit status to be displayed in Azure Boards."

You would still need to create a custom integration between the service hook and Microsoft Teams to receive notifications, which can be complex and time-consuming.\n\nOn the other hand, Option B - configuring a connector in Microsoft Teams - is a more straightforward approach. Microsoft Teams provides a built-in connector for Azure DevOps, which allows you to easily receive notifications for work item updates directly within a Teams channel. This simplifies the setup process, making it a more suitable solution for your requirement.\n\nIn summary, while both options could ultimately achieve the desired outcome, configuring a connector in Microsoft Teams (Option B) is a more direct and convenient method for receiving notifications when work items are updated in Azure DevOps."
