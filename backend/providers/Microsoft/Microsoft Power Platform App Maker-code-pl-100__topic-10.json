    "answerDescription": "Box 1: Choice -<br>Students select one main cuisine to specialize in when applying for enrollment.<br>A choice (picklist) is a type of column that can be included in a table. It defines a set of options. When a choice is displayed in a form it uses a drop-down list control. When displayed in Advanced Find it uses a picklist control. Sometimes choices are called picklists by developers.<br>You can define a choice to use a set of options defined within itself (locally) or it can use a set of options defined elsewhere (globally) which can be used by other choice columns.<br>Global choices are useful when you have a standard set of categories that can apply to more than one column. Maintaining two separate choices with the same values is difficult and if they are not synchronized you can see errors, especially if you are mapping table columns in a one-to-many table relationship.<br>Note: If you define every choice as a global choice your list of global choices will grow and could be difficult to manage. If you know that the set of options will only be used in one place, use a local choice.<br><br>Box 2: Global choice -<br>The college generates a QR code for high-volume subscribers to allow staff to vote for their favorite dishes.<br>Subscribers should be able to mark a dish as favorite directly from their order.<br><br>Box 3: Whole number -<br>Dish votes are counted based on the number of people who marked the dish as a favorite.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-global-option-sets",
