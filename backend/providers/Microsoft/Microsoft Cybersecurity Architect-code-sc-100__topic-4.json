Using a private endpoint, you can access Azure services such as Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, and others over a private IP address in your virtual network. With a private endpoint, traffic between your virtual network and the Azure service travels over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.\n\nIn this scenario, using a private endpoint for the Microsoft SQL Server databases on the on-premises network would provide a secure connection between the web apps and the databases without requiring a Site-to-Site VPN or an ExpressRoute connection. This would minimize the number of open internet-accessible endpoints to the on-premises network, which would help enhance security."

You can create DLP policies that identify PHI within stored documents and communications and then set rules to prevent the PHI from being shared outside the company. For example, you can create a DLP policy that blocks emails containing PHI from being sent to external recipients, or that prevents documents containing PHI from being shared outside the organization.\n\nSensitivity label policies allow you to classify and protect sensitive information, but they do not specifically prevent the information from being shared outside the organization. Insider risk management policies are designed to detect and mitigate risks posed by insider threats, but they are not directly related to preventing the sharing of sensitive information. Retention policies allow you to specify how long certain types of information should be retained, but they do not prevent the sharing of sensitive information."

Therefore, it is more effective to prioritize identifying the scope and impacted LOB applications first, and then move on to identifying the compromise recovery process and implementing measures to reduce the risk of privileged access compromise.\n\nA comprehensive and proactive approach to cybersecurity is essential to prevent and mitigate the impact of cyber incidents. This includes adopting best practices and following established incident response procedures, continuously monitoring systems and networks for potential threats, and regularly reviewing and updating security policies and procedures to adapt to changing threats and circumstances"
