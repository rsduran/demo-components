In Group Policy Management, create a Group Policy setting to specify DSCP values.\n\nBy setting the Insert Quality of Service (QoS) markers for real-time media traffic as Enabled in the Microsoft Teams admin center, you allow Teams to automatically assign audio and video data packets with a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value. To ensure that computers prioritize real-time media traffic, you will need to create a Group Policy setting to specify the DSCP values. This will ensure that real-time media traffic has priority over other network activities. Setting the media port range and media bit rate is not necessary to prioritize audio and video during Teams meetings. Creating a network roaming policy in the Teams PowerShell module is not relevant to this scenario."

If the toll-free number stops working but local toll numbers are still functional, it\u2019s likely that the organization has run out of Communication Credits. By adding more Communication Credits, you can ensure that the toll-free number continues to work. Ugh typical MS question.. but i am now thinking C might be the correct answer"
