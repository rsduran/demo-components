Since TAC even specifically mentions EV, I think this question is fairly clear."

They often contain outdated info; e.g. there are still many references to \"Lync\" and \"Skype\" in PS even for greenfield Teams deployments. But after taking the exam, I agree with you that it is unambiguous in the exam's context. There are several instances in it that refer to \"Enterprise Voice\" in the exam, and it is unambiguous that it refers to voice services for Teams, not as a license granting voice capabilities for SfB (it can mean both, as I cautioned). Hope that helps folks!"
