Linked virtual networks have full access and can resolve all DNS records published in the private zone. You can also enable autoregistration on a virtual network link. When you enable autoregistration on a virtual network link, the DNS records for the virtual machines in that virtual network are registered in the private zone. When autoregistration gets enabled, Azure DNS will update the zone record whenever a virtual machine gets created, changes its' IP address, or gets deleted.\n\nThe only way to change the IP address is to set it to static within the portal as changing it on the VM itself is a BIG no no.

This is more than enough to accommodate 200 virtual machines per subnet while leaving some room for network infrastructure addresses (e.g., gateway).\nA /120 subnet mask offers the necessary address space while conserving address allocations for other potential subnets or uses within your Azure virtual network."

We can further subnet the network beyond 16 bits of Subnet ID, by borrowing host bits; but it is recommended that 64 bits should always be used for hosts addresses because auto-configuration requires 64 bits.\nIPv6 subnetting works on the same concept as Variable Length Subnet Masking in IPv4.\n/48 prefix can be allocated to an organization providing it the benefit of having up to /64 subnet prefixes, which is 65535 sub-networks, each having 264 hosts. A /64 prefix can be assigned to a point-to-point connection where there are only two hosts (or IPv6 enabled devices) on a link."
