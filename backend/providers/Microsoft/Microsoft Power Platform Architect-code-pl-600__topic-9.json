    "answerDescription": "Box 1: Create and embed a Power Bi radial gauge<br>A radial gauge chart has a circular arc and shows a single value that measures progress toward a goal or a Key Performance Indicator (KPI). The line (or needle) represents the goal or target value. The shading represents the progress toward that goal. The value inside the arc represents the progress value. Power BI spreads all possible values evenly along the arc, from the minimum (left-most value) to the maximum (right-most value).<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04333/0017100001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>In this example, you're a car retailer tracking the sales team's average sales per month. The needle represents a 140 cars sales goal. The minimum possible average sales is 0 and the maximum is 200. The blue shading shows that the team is averaging approximately 120 sales this month.<br>Box 2: Add an inspection order to the work order form<br>You can add inspections to work orders in Dynamics 365 Field Service.<br>Field Service inspections are digital forms that technicians use to quickly and easily answer a list of questions as part of a work order. The list of questions can include safety protocols, pass-and-fail tests for a customer asset, an interview with a customer, or other audits and assessments performed before, during, or after a work order.<br>Example:<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04333/0017200001.jpg\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/field-service/inspections",

The Power Apps donut chart would be for looking at multiple records (which in this scenario, we are not).\n\nQuestion 2: Modify the Sitemap - The trick is the question is asking about viewing recordS.  Adding a form to a form would give technicians the ability to see more information about a single inspection, from a single machine record.  A valid business ask but is not what the question here is about.  Offline sync is unrelated and can be excluded because users are onsite."

However, the requirement states that inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed. This implies that there could be multiple images for different inspection steps within a single inspection order.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, creates a relationship within the Inspection Order table to the originating inspection order, which allows linking the new inspection order (created for re-inspection) to the original one. This way, the photos taken during the previously failed inspection can be accessed and viewed in the new inspection order, resolving the issue reported during testing."
