It also states that the storage must be in the same location as the nsg. That much I get. But can someone explain to me how the NSG being in the same region as the storage applies to this question? I only see mention of 2 NSGs  in the example and neither are applied to VNET 4 where VM 5 is. As far as I can tell, only the storage type is relevant to this question. I\u2019m open to being wrong if someone can explain it. Thanks."

        "content": "Correct Answer is: B (Storage 2)\n\nNetwork Watcher 'Flow Logs' tool is used to log information about Azure IP traffic and stores the data in Azure storage. You can log IP traffic using either of the two following tools:\ni. NSG Flow Logs (log information about IP traffic flowing through a network security group) or \nii. VNET Flow Logs (log information about IP traffic flowing through a virtual network)\n\nIt is to be noted that NSG flow logs have a retention feature that allows deleting the logs automatically up to a year after their creation. Retention is available only if you use general-purpose v2 storage accounts.\nSo, despite the fact that there is no mention of NSG for VM5, in order to make use of retention feature, NSG flow must be implemented which would need GPv2 storage account. Also, VNET Flow logs is currently in Preview and is not recommended for Production workloads.\nRef:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview"

This means that the flow log data is retained for only 30 days before being automatically deleted.\n\nIf you need to retain flow log data for a longer period and that is what we need 8 months, you may consider using General Purpose v2 (GPv2) storage accounts instead, which support flow logging with a retention period of up to 365 days."
