This can lead to cost savings, especially if your application performs a high volume of point reads on the same data.\n\nWhen dealing with point reads, the cache can be highly effective in reducing the number of RUs needed for frequently accessed items, as long as those items are cached and served as cache hits."

Custom Conflict Resolution Policy with Stored Proc:  Conflicts do NOT show up in conflict feed unless there's an error in your stored procedure\n3. Custom Conflict Resolution Policy: Conflicts DO show up in conflict feed.\n\nThis question is asking about item #2, which does NOT show up in the conflict feed by default.  Now, if there is an error in the stored procedure it would be, but I'm assuming the question isn't considering this, as it isn't stated.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-manage-conflicts?tabs=dotnetv2%2Capi-async%2Casync#create-a-custom-conflict-resolution-policy"
