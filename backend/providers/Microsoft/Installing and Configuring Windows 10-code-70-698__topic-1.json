Each answer choice may be used once, more than once, or not at all.<br>Your network contains a single Active Directory domain. The domain contains a VPN server that supports all of the VPN protocols.<br>From a computer that runs Windows 10 Pro, a user named User1 creates an SSTP VPN connection to a network named VPN1.<br>User1 successfully connects to the VPN server. When User1 roams between different Wi-Fi access points, the user loses the connection to the corporate network and must manually re-establish the VPN connection.<br>You need to ensure that VPN1 automatically maintains the connection while the user roams between Wi-Fi access points.<br>What should you do?<br>",
