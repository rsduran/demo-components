No, it does not.\n\nImplementing On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) alone does not accomplish the objective of controlling access to Azure Blob storage based on a role.\n\nOn-premises AD DS is designed for managing user accounts, groups, and authentication within an on-premises network. It does not directly integrate with Azure Blob storage to control access based on roles.\n\nTo achieve role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure Blob storage, you should consider integrating Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with your application. Azure AD provides a cloud-based identity and access management solution that can be used to define roles, assign permissions, and control access to Azure resources, including Blob storage.\n\nBy implementing Azure AD integration, you can manage access to Blob storage based on roles defined in Azure AD, granting or restricting access to users or groups based on their assigned roles."
