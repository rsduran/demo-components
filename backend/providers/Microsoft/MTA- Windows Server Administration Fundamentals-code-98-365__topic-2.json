The most used are as follows:\n\nRAID 0 is known as disk striping and offers higher read and write performance but it is not fault-tolerant. On Windows Server 2019, you can create a striped volume if you convert the disk from basic to dynamic.\nRAID 1 is known as disk mirroring and requires at least two disks for its implementation while offering excellent read and write performance. It works in such a way that all the data that resides on disk A is mirrored on disk B. In the case of disk failure, the RAID controller uses any of the available disks.\nRAID 5 is known as disk striping with parity and requires three disks for its implementation at a minimum. It represents the most fault-tolerant RAID that's available. The parity data is spread across all disks, meaning that RAID 5 can withstand the failure of a single disk.\nRAID 10 is known as the stripe of mirrors and combines RAID 1 with RAID 0, thus offering disk mirroring and striping at the same time. It requires four disks for its implementation at a minimum. In the case of disk failure, the rebuild time is very fast since the striping is spread across all drives.\n\nAnswer: NO change."
