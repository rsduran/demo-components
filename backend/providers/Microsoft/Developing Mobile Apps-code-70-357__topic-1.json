You can find out how to register your app from the identity provider. After registering, the online provider typically gives you an Id or secret key for your app.<br>Step 2: Build the authentication request URI<br>The request URI consists of the address where you send the authentication request to your online provider appended with other required information, such as an app ID or secret, a redirect URI where the user is sent after completing authentication, and the expected response type. You can find out from your provider what parameters are required.<br>Step 3-4: Connect to the online provider<br>You call the AuthenticateAsync method to connect to the online identity provider and get an access token. The method takes the URI constructed in the previous step as the requestUri parameter, and a URI to which you want the user to be redirected as the callbackUri parameter.<br>Note: Step 5: Connecting with single sign-on (SSO).<br>By default, Web authentication broker does not allow cookies to persist. Because of this, even if the app user indicates that they want to stay logged in (for example, by selecting a check box in the provider's login dialog), they will have to login each time they want to access resources for that provider. To login with<br>SSO, your online identity provider must have enabled SSO for Web authentication broker, and your app must call the overload of AuthenticateAsync that does not take a callbackUri parameter. This will allow persisted cookies to be stored by the web authentication broker, so that future authentication calls by the same app will not require repeated sign-in by the user (the user is effectively \"logged in\" until the access token expires).<br>Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/web-authentication-broker",

    "answerDescription": "Microsoft Hello -<br>Microsoft Hello provides simple multi-factor authentication using facial recognition (or iris, or fingerprints) that is used to access the Microsoft Passport private key stored in the secure TPM chip. For the first time, Microsoft has included the biometric software (middleware) in Windows 10 to support biometrics for authentication. In previous versions of Windows, the OEM (HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc) needed to add its own biometric middleware to support biometric authentication.<br>From scenario: The app must meet the following requirements related to security:<br>Use a multi-factor authentication (MFA) by using email and a verification code to identify the user.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01210/0015500001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Securely store credentials and retrieve credentials.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01210/0015500002.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Automatically sign in the user irrespective of the device that is used to sign in to the app.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01210/0015500003.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Store the resource name within the app itself.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01210/0015500004.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Connect to an authentication app by using the URI schema fabrikam-security://oauth/.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/01210/0015500005.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br><br>Note: Microsoft Passport -<br>Microsoft has resurrected the Passport moniker for a new PKI credential system that requires multi-factor authentication. Most interesting about Microsoft Passport is that it fully supports the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance standards which means it will work with many web/cloud services without modification. The plan is that users of cloud services supporting FIDO is that there will no longer be passwords associated with the users account.<br>Microsoft Passport involves a user logging onto the Windows 10 computer with multi-factor (PIN, face, iris, fingerprint, etc) and either creating a new account or associating an existing account with an IDentity Provider (IDP). Windows generates a public/private key pair with the private key stored securely outside of the<br>Windows 10 OS. The public key is associated with the account so that a challenge can be sent that can only correctly respond to the IDP. Another key point to the<br>Microsoft Passport credential system is that the user needs to enroll every device used to access the service (IDP).<br>Reference:<br>https://adsecurity.org/?p=1535",
