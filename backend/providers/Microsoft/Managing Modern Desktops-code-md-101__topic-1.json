While it can help prevent malicious software from being executed on the workstations, it is not designed to control which specific applications can be run on the workstations.\n\nTo meet the goal of ensuring that the workstations are only able to run applications that you have explicitly permitted, you will need to use additional controls such as AppLocker or an app deployment policy in Microsoft Intune.
