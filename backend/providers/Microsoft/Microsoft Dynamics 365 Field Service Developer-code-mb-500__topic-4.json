Within the scope of the method, these parameters are treated as local variables and are initialized with a value from the parameter in the method call.

So any changes to the buffer made in the updateValues() method are actually made to the original buffer in the run() method.\n\n2)\nThe salesQty variable, on the other hand, is converted to and passed as a String, then converted back to integer. This means that we're are actually modifying the value of a COPY of the original variable, NOT the value of the original variable itself. Also the COPY of the original value only exists while executing the updateValues() method and it's value is never returned to the run() method.

    "answerDescription": "Box 1: Yes -<br>Class extension - Method wrapping and Chain of Command.<br>The functionality for class extension, or class augmentation, has been improved. You can now wrap logic around methods that are defined in the base class that you're augmenting. You can extend the logic of public and protected methods without having to use event handlers. When you wrap a method, you can also access public and protected methods, and variables of the base class. In this way, you can start transactions and easily manage state variables that are associated with your class.<br><br>Box 2: Yes -<br>In the following example, the wrapper around doSomething and the required use of the next keyword create a Chain of Command (CoC) for the method. CoC is a design pattern where a request is handled by a series of receivers. The pattern supports loose coupling of the sender and the receivers<br>[ExtensionOf(classStr(BusinessLogic1))]<br>final class BusinessLogic1_Extension<br>{<br>str doSomething(int arg)<br>{<br>// Part 1<br>var s = next doSomething(arg + 4);<br>// Part 2<br>return s;<br>}<br>}<br><br>Box 3: Yes -<br>Instance and static methods can be wrapped by extension classes. If a static method is the target that will be wrapped, the method in the extension must be qualified by using the static keyword.<br><br>Box 4: No -<br>Wrapper methods must always call next.<br>Note: Wrapper methods in an extension class must always call next, so that the next method in the chain and, finally, the original implementation are always called. This restriction helps guarantee that every method in the chain contributes to the result.<br>In the current implementation of this restriction, the call to next must be in the first-level statements in the method body.<br>Here are some important rules:<br>\u2711 Calls to next can't be done conditionally inside an if statement.<br>\u2711 Calls to next can't be done in while, do-while, or for loop statements.<br>\u2711 A next statement can't be preceded by a return statement.<br>\u2711 Because logical expressions are optimized, calls to next can't occur in logical expressions. At runtime, the execution of the complete expression isn't guaranteed.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/extensibility/method-wrapping-coc",

You just instantiate the original/extended class and you get access to the new methods and members..\n\nIn your given link there are multiple code snippets, which support my explanation:\n1. Look here at the second code snippet - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/extensibility/class-extensions#instance-methods - they instantiate the original/extended MyClass \"MyClass c = new MyClass();\", they DO NOT instantiate the extension class (THIS IS WRONG) \"MyClass_Extension = new MyClass_Extension();\"\n\n2.
