You can create a compliance policy for passwords for each OS, so you don't need to create a config profile for passwords. You do need to create config profiles for wifi though, so you will need one for each OS. So answer is 2.\nI don't see any reason for treating compliance policies the same as config profiles when they have separate blades, and a profile is not the same as a policy conceptually. The question asks for minimum amount of config profiles needed, so even if you could create config profiles for the passwords, you don't need to when you can create compliance policies instead. It's possible to do it with 4 but you don't need to. You need a minimum of 2. That's how I read it and make sense of it, not sure if Microsoft sees it the same way or not. That's the real question. How will Microsoft see it?"

Since Policy2 blocks, it will take precedence so you would need to disable that policy as well. Following that logic, the answer would be to choose B and D.

Once you have the templates, you need to add them to the Central Store on a DC. \n\nYou can install RSAT and manage the policies from any system, it doesn't have to be a server. But upgrading Server1 to 2019 won't add those policy templates (ADMX and ADML files) to the domain. That's a manual add. If the DC's don't already have the templates applied, you can upgrade Server1 all day long and it's not going to help because the target of the templates has to be on a DC. \n\nNow, with all MS exams you have to be careful to answer the question as it's written, not trying to extrapolate the missing information on the other end.
