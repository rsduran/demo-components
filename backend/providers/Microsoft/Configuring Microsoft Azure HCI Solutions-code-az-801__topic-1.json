It configures the routes required for traffic to pass between the peered virtual networks (VNet1 and VNet2).

Create a route table and associate the table with GatewaySubnet on VNet1.\n\nReason below:\n1- User1 is already able to establish a Point-to-Site (P2S) connection to GW1 to access AppSvr1. This indicates that the VPN client on Computer1 is configured correctly for the existing P2S connection.\n\n2- The problem is that User1 cannot access AppSvr2, which is located in Vnet2 and not directly connected to the P2S connection. To enable User1 to access resources in Vnet2, you need to ensure that the traffic from the P2S connection is correctly routed to Vnet2.\n\n3- Creating a route table and associating it with the GatewaySubnet on VNet1 allows you to define custom routes for the VPN traffic. You can configure the route table to route traffic destined for Vnet2 through the peering connection between Vnet1 and Vnet2."

While Domain Admins of the child domain theoretically possess the ability to add a new domain controller, the Active Directory forest and domain need to be prepared for Windows Server 2022 DC, which mandates permissions from both Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, it wouldn't be advisable to grant Admin1 the combined permissions of Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins simply to facilitate the addition of a new domain controller in the child domain. However, for the purposes of this hypothetical scenario, we must assume that Admin1 is the sole administrator tasked with this responsibility, thereby requiring the elevated permissions without additional administrative support for forest and domain preparation prior to the addition of the new domain controller.\n\nMy answer is D"
