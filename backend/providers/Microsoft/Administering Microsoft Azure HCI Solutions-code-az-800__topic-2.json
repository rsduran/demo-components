To onboard a machine to Azure Arc, the user needs the Azure Connected Machine Onboarding role. This role gives the user the necessary permissions to register the machine with Azure Arc.

You need the proper Azure role assigned to enable the integration between the local server and Azure Arc.\n\nHere's why the option is not the first step.\nA. From the Azure portal, generate a new onboarding script: This is typically done after you've assigned the necessary role permissions to the user. You generate the script to onboard the machines once the user has the required permissions."

This process involves installing the PowerShell DSC VM extension on the VMs (if it's not already installed), and registering the VMs with the Azure Automation DSC service.\nAs part of the onboarding process, you assign a Node Configuration to each VM. The PowerShell DSC VM extension on each VM then periodically checks with the Azure Automation DSC service, pulls the assigned Node Configuration, and ensures that the VM is configured according to that Node Configuration.\nThe compliance status of each VM (whether it's correctly configured according to its assigned Node Configuration) is then reported back to Azure Automation DSC, and you can view this status in the Azure portal."
