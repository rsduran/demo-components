However, to move WebAPP1 to another region from West Europe to North Europe is same similar as from RG1 to RG4 that is a link pointed to North Europe but the data is still storaged at West Europe. Therefore, the APP service won't change but policy change to policy2. If want to move all WebAPP1 to North Europe, here should use 'colone' function to have a copy of WebAPP1.
