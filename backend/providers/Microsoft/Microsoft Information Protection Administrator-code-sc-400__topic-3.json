When a retention tag is removed from the retention policy applied to a mailbox, the tag is no longer available to the user and can't be applied to items in the mailbox. Existing items that have been stamped with that tag continue to be processed by the Managed Folder Assistant based on those settings and any retention action specified in the tag is applied to those messages.

This causes the Managed Folder Assistant to process all items in a mailbox and restamp the ones that have the removed tag applied.

Trainable classifiers in Microsoft 365, specifically sensitive information types, can be trained to recognize patterns in data, including file names, and apply actions based on the identified patterns.\n\nIn this scenario, you would create a trainable classifier that recognizes the naming format of the project documents (e.g., files with names like \"aei_AA989.docx\"). Once trained, you can use the trainable classifier to create an auto-apply retention label policy that automatically applies the label to documents that match the specified naming pattern.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC.

Once the difference is understood, the concept can be applied to all questions having an SIT and trainable classifier.\n\nSensitive Information Types (SITs) are classifiers that detect specific patterns in sensitive data like social security or credit card numbers. Microsoft offers numerous preconfigured SITs, but custom ones can also be created. They're used when the data to classify has a known pattern.\n\nA Trainable Classifier is a tool that learns to identify various content types through exposure to numerous examples. Once trained, it can be used to apply Office sensitivity labels, Communications compliance policies, and retention label policies. Its accuracy improves with more data. It's used when the data to classify lacks a specific pattern. So, use it when you have a big enough sample with unknown pattern.\n\nThe given answers are correct."
