Therefore, User3 cannot access the files in Share1.<br><br>Box 3: Yes -<br>Group2 has write permission to Folder1.  However, Group2 has no permission on Share1.  Therefore, users in Group2 cannot access files in the shared folder.<br>Access Based Enumeration when enabled hides files and folders that users do not have permission to access.

LinuxKit provides a container based Linux OS, and there's some integration to make it appear less like a VM to the end user, e.g. you can use 127.0.0.1 instead of the IP of the VirtualBox VM. If you have Hyper-V available and want to run Linux containers on Windows, this is the preferred option.\n\n    Windows Server Containers which run Windows binaries on the same host OS, similar to how Linux containers on a Linux OS do not need a VM.\n\n    Hyper-V Containers which run Windows binaries inside of a separate VM for additional isolation."

When a client computer requests authentication, Active Directory will use the subnet-to-site association to determine which site the client computer is in, and will then direct the authentication request to a domain controller in that site. By associating the new subnet with Site1, client computers in the new office will be directed to authenticate with domain controllers in Site1."

DNS then provides the IP address of the domain controller to the client for the purpose of connecting to the domain controller. For this reason, it is important to ensure that the IP address that you assign to a domain controller maps to a subnet that is associated with the site of the respective server object\n\nAnswer is Yes"

This involves making changes to domain controllers.  Reason being is that when client try to access \\\\contoso.com, they will end up accessing domain controllers because the domain name contoso.com points to all domain controllers of that domain.\n\nEffectively you will need to create a share named \"document\" on domain controller, within the share create two shortcuts that points to \\\\SRV1\\%sharename% respectively."
