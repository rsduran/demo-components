When this property is enabled, filters that users set on the request page will be stored in the database, in the Page Data Personalization table. As a result, the filters are still set the next time request page is opened.\n\nFilters are only saved when the request page is closed after the user selects either Print or an action from the Send To menu. The filters aren't saved when the request page closes after the user selects Preview or Cancel.\n\nYou can later use the saved settings to consistently generate the same reports, XMLports, or batch jobs. For more information about users work with saved settings, see Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch jobs in the business functionality help.\n\nNote on bad answer\nB makes absolutely no sense. Create a variable, then assign a value, that is not even saved or used is dumb. VS Code, properly configured with proper codecop will give notice of assigned but unused value."

You plan to call this module Issue Management. The module must expose a method named PostIssue.<br>Code modifications will be required over time.<br>The Issue Management process must be split into two extensions:<br><br>ISSUE BASE: main extension -<br>ISSUE EXT: second extension with dependency from ISSUE BASE<br>In the version 1.0.0.0 of the ISSUE BASE extension, you plan to create an Issue table that contains a global Decimal variable named IssueTotal.<br>In the version 1.0.0.0 of the ISSUE BASE extension, you plan to define a table named Issue Category with a Description field defined as follows:<br><img title=\"image101\" src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-820/image101.png\"><br>The Issue table defined in ISSUE BASE extension contains a Clone procedure defined as follows:<br><img title=\"image102\" src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-820/image102.png\"><br>In the ISSUE EXT extension, you create a tableextension object of the Issue table.<br>The tableextension object of the Issue table must access the IssueTotal: Decimal variable.<br>After weeks of usage, you discover that you must remove the Description field and the Clone procedure because they are no longer required.<br>In a new version of the ISSUE BASE extension, you create a new Issue Type table. You must move data row by row from a previously obsolete Issue Category table to the new Issue Type table. Because a large amount of data must be moved, you must write an Upgrade codeunit by using the DataTransfer object.<br>The IT department creates a custom API for exposing the custom Issue table. The API provides an action for copying an issue to a new table. The action is defined as follows:<br><img title=\"image103\" src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-820/image103.png\"><br>Contoso, Ltd. must create an API in Business Central to expose item details to the mobile application.<br>The API must have the lowest possible impact on the production environment when used during working hours.<br>The API must only support Get operations.<br><br>Debugging problems -<br>A user of the ISSUE BASE extension in Business Central reports a problem.<br>To debug the problem, snapshot debugging with the following configuration was activated:<br><img title=\"image104\" src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/mb-820/image104.png\"><br>You discover that the debugging is not triggering.<br>Integration with business partner for subcontracting<br>Contoso, Ltd. must connect Business Central to the external API provided by the business partner.
