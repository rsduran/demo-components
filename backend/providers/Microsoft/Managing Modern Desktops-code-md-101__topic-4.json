I found this on web \"Hybrid Azure AD join and co-management are two different things:\n\"\nCo-management enables you to concurrently manage a Windows 10 device with both Configuration Manager and Intune. You install the Configuration Manager client and enroll the device to Intune. The device communicates with both services. Configuration Manager policy controls which workloads you switch to Intune as the management authority. Co-management requires that the device has a cloud identity. This identity can be either hybrid Azure AD join or Azure AD join only.\n\nFor an existing Configuration Manager client that's already joined to Active Directory, it needs to be hybrid joined before you enable co-management.\n\nFor new devices that are only cloud domain-joined with Azure AD, you can enable co-management right away. There's no requirement for hybrid Azure AD join for new co-managed devices.\n\"\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/comanage/faq"
