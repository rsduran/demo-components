The information will be retrieved from the stored access policy when authorization takes place. Also, unlike with the adhoc SAS URI, if you want to revoke access, you can simply change the stored access policy and all SAS URI\u2019s that inherited from that stored access policy will immediately be modified; this is preferable to changing the storage account key!\nhttps://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/cloud/platform-as-a-service/azure-blob-storage-part-9-shared-access-signatures/"
