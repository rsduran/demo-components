If the local system does not have this image already, then docker will automatically try and fetch it.

We don't want the .NET core SDK included in our final image because we only need the .NET core runtime, so the dockerfile is written to use a temporary container that is packaged with the SDK called build-env to build the app.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/building-sample-app",

This means that before changes can be merged, the code must compile successfully, which is the requirement you're trying to enforce. By using a build policy, you can ensure that every pull request builds successfully before it's merged into the main branch.\n\nAction 2: Pull requests must have a Quality Gate status of Passed in SonarCloud\n\nPolicy: Status policy\n\nA status policy requires that an external service posts a status to the pull request. In this case, the external service would be SonarCloud. SonarCloud can analyze the code and check whether it meets the defined quality standards (Quality Gates). If it does, SonarCloud can then post a Passed status to the pull request. The status policy will then check this status before allowing the pull request to be merged.\n\nCheck-in policy is a term associated with TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control), not Git, hence it is not applicable here."

You can configure the File System Agent plug-in to scan only the Package.json files of your Node.js projects, and ignore the Package-lock.json and Npm-shrinkwrap.json files. This way, you will minimize the number of libraries reported by WhiteSource to only the libraries that you explicitly reference in the Package.json files.\n\nB. Adding a devDependencies section to Package-lock.json will not work, because the Package-lock.json file is automatically generated by npm and should not be manually edited. The devDependencies section in Package-lock.json reflects the devDependencies from the Package.json file of the dependency, not the project.\n\n\nSource: Bing AI :)"

By default, the npm install command installs all dependencies, including those specified in devDependencies.\n\nHowever, by running npm install --omit-dev, you can exclude the packages listed in devDependencies from being installed. This can help reduce the size of the installed packages and the time it takes to install them, especially in production environments where only the packages needed for runtime are required."

Whats going to happen if the pipeline isnt cached?  in the first answer, the pipeline would just stop/fail if npm isnt cached.  So how would you have npm cached in the first place? \n\n For the 2nd answer, what happens if npm isnt cached?  npm gets installed, then we move to the next step.\n\nThe step being shown isnt a build step.  its a step that ensures that npm is installed BEFORE the build.sh uses npm in another step.

IMHO no, but it works. And you can do it even using just one template. In an ARM template you can establish the order of resource deployment by dependencies. So you can easily establish to create first the resource group and then the resources you want to put in. You can establish that all the resources that would be contained in the resource group has a dependsOn the resource group resource.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/resource-dependency"

(On macOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, container jobs are not available.) Containers provide isolation from the host and allow you to pin specific versions of tools and dependencies. Host jobs require less initial setup and infrastructure to maintain.\n\nContainers offer a lightweight abstraction over the host operating system. You can select the exact versions of operating systems, tools, and dependencies that your build requires. When you specify a container in your pipeline, the agent will first fetch and start the container. Then, each step of the job will run inside the container. You can't have nested containers. Containers aren't supported when an agent is already running inside a container."

This article helps you take advantage of the tools we have for managing paid access for users.

You could automate azure devops users group memberships using group rules. Yes, you can do it but only the first time you ASSIGN the membership to the users. If after some days you want to change this membership how do you think to di it automatically? Of course you can't, because now you can't know which group you want to assign a particular user to in several days. This operation, \"modifying group memberships\" is to be done manually."

The easiest way to do this is to add an ARM template deployment task to Pipeline1 that assigns Policy1 to Subscription1.\n\nTo do this, create an ARM template that includes a policy assignment resource that references Policy1. Then, add an ARM template deployment task to Pipeline1 that deploys this template to Subscription1.\n\nThe task should be configured to only deploy the policy assignment resource, rather than the entire ARM template, to reduce the impact on other resources in Subscription1.

This approach can be used to ensure that all resources deployed by Pipeline1 comply with Policy1.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this approach requires that Policy1 is already assigned to the subscription being deployed to.
