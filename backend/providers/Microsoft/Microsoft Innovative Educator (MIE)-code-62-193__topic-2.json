These objectives include developing collaboration, communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity skills among students. By incorporating these resources, teachers can design activities that foster collaboration and problem-solving skills among students, which is in line with the stated learning objectives. Therefore, option A best describes how the new ICT resources contribute to meeting the goals of the ICT Competency Framework for Teachers."

One of the key aspects of collaborative learning is the ability for students to share their work, ideas, and resources with each other. With individual laptops, students can easily share their work digitally, collaborate on projects, provide feedback to their peers, and engage in discussions through online platforms or collaborative tools. This fosters a collaborative learning environment where students can actively participate, exchange ideas, and work together towards common goals. Therefore, option A best describes how giving each student their own laptop enhances collaborative learning."
