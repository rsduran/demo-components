For example, you might have a Teachers table and a Class table, and the Class table might have a lookup relation to the Teachers table to show which teacher teaches the class. You can use a lookup column to show data from the Teachers table.<br>This is commonly referred to as a lookup column.<br>The LookUp function finds the first record in a table that satisfies a formula. Use LookUp to find a single record that matches one or more criteria. For both, the formula is evaluated for each record of the table<br><br>Box 2: Choices -<br>You can customize forms (main, quick create, and quick view) and email templates by adding multi-select columns that are called Choices. When you add a choices column, you can specify multiple values that will be available for users to select. When users fill out the form they can select one, multiple, or all the values displayed in a drop-down list.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/types-of-fields",

The company operates offices in multiple countries/regions.<br><br>First Up has both full-time and part-time employees. The company has a team or worker support agents that respond to inquiries from current and prospective workers. Some of the worker support agents are multilingual.<br><br>The company does not have a standardized tool used for reporting purposes. The organization engages you to implement a new Microsoft Power Platform solution. Workers are managed by a dedicated team that includes one primary recruiter and a contract assistant. Many client companies live in areas that do not allow for mobile data connections.<br><br><br>Current environment<br> -<br><br><br>Existing systems and processes<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tFirst Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br>\u2022\tThe company plans to reference historical data in the existing system. The records held in these systems will not be migrated to the new solution except for medication information.<br>\u2022\tEmployee authentication with the existing system is provided by an on-premises Active Directory instance that is linked to Microsoft Entra ID.<br>\u2022\tAn appointment record is created for each visit with a worker. The record includes worker contact information, preferred language, the date and time of the appointment, and other relevant data.

While it\u2019s possible, desktop flows are generally better suited for automating tasks on a local machine rather than cloud-based tasks.\n\nC. Create a cloud flow.

This approach is more scalable and efficient for handling real-time data and automations that need to run in the cloud.\n\nThe key advantage of C is that cloud flows are inherently more suited for tasks that involve web services and APIs, making them more reliable and easier to manage for this type of requirement."

It defines a capability that end users need to perform, which is logging in through SSO.\nE. Users must be able to submit a service request on a Power Pages site.\n\nExplanation: Allowing users to submit a service request is a functional requirement as it relates to what the system needs to support for user interaction. It describes a key feature for the Power Pages site.\nNon-Functional Requirements:\nA and D relate to performance and infrastructure, which are non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability and caching improvements).\nB is more related to data privacy and compliance, which also falls into non-functional requirements, such as security and data governance."

Other reports may be limited to specific offices.<br>\u2022\tYou must create dashboards that show the status across all groups of workers. The dashboards must be embedded into the Power Platform apps. Updates to data must be displayed in near real time.<br><br><br>Security<br> -<br><br>\u2022\tAuthentication for all user types must be managed by a single platform. IT teams must use PowerShell to apply security permissions for users.<br>\u2022\tWorker records must only be viewed by the recruiting office that the worker visits.<br>\u2022\tWorker skill records must be archived after ten years and are then removed from the main system.
