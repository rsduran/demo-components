If you want to activate the 365 E3 license on a user basis, you need to log in to the PC using your AAD account, not AD. So either she has to login using her AAD account instead, or she could perform an Autopilot-reset to trigger a device-based license activation. It feels like some info is missing in the question, but triggering an Autopilot-reset for a device-based license activation is a possibility and it would explain why she's not trying any of the other methods. So I'd vote for D indeed."

Assign a Windows 10 Enterprise license to MHamm, and then activate Computer1.\n\nExplanation:\nTo activate Windows 10 on a computer, it must have a valid license. In this scenario, Mia Hamm is using a computer named Computer1 that is not activated. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that Mia Hamm has a valid Windows 10 Enterprise license and then activate Computer1 using that license.\n\nSince all users in the domain have been issued Microsoft 365 E3 licenses, we can assume that Mia Hamm already has a valid license. Therefore, we just need to assign the license to her Active Directory user account and then activate Computer1."

This feature enables IT administrators to prepare and configure devices for their users without the need for any physical intervention.\n\nWhen a user initiates an AutoPilot Reset on their device, it removes all user data, settings, and applications from the device and reverts it to its original state as if it was just unboxed. During the reset process, the device is automatically reconfigured and enrolled into AAD, so the user can quickly and easily sign back into the device with their AAD credentials.\n\nAutoPilot Reset can be initiated by an end-user or an administrator using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (formerly known as Microsoft Intune). This feature is useful when a device is lost, stolen, or needs to be repurposed."

None of that was stated, so, the correct answer is C since it already has the Enterprise version on the computer.  You can't buy Enterprise, thaf version comes with VLK.

VAMT is a tool used to manage and deploy volume activation for Windows operating systems. It can be used to activate client computers running Windows 10 by using the Volume Activation (VA) method, which requires a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) or a Key Management Service (KMS) host key. MAK activation is a one-time process that requires online activation, but KMS activation does not require an internet connection.\n\nKMS activation requires a minimum of 25 client computers to be activated before the KMS host can activate other client computers. However, VAMT can be used to activate client computers with KMS activation without meeting the 25 computer minimum requirement by using the VAMT Proxy Activation feature. This allows VAMT to act as a KMS host for a single client computer, which can then be activated without an internet connection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, make use of the Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT)."
