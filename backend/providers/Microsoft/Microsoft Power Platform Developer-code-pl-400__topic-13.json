    "answerDescription": "While Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Power Automate, and Microsoft Power Apps offer over 325+ connectors to connect to Microsoft and verified services, you may want to communicate with services that aren't available as prebuilt connectors. Custom connectors address this scenario by allowing you to create (and even share) a connector with its own triggers and actions.<br>Note:<br>Each of the third-party services charge per result. Northwind wants to perform the background check processes only when necessary to minimize costs.<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0023100001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/",
