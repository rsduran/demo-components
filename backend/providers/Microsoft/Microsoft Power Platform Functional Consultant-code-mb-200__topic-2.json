The only form I think that can be used is the card form to display the data of the stream list\n5 - It's a tricky question because quick view form can also be displayed as card. But since the question talks about \"parent record\", the answer should be quick view form. A parent record on a form is displayed with a lookup and quick view form are meant to display further info regarding a lookup. Cards instead are likely used in subgrids, so more for child records."

In the answer they explicitly refer to each person on the team\n3 - Export the user chart to Microsoft Power BI. Import it as a Power BI visualization - INCORRECT - you can only export as a XML (no option to export for Power BI)\n4 - Export the user chart for import as a user chart - CORRECT - as a sales person, I can export the chart as XML.
