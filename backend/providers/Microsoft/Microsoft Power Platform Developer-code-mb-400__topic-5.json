Therefore, it would be possible to trigger the plug-in code even without actually having permission to do so and great consideration must be used when writing a pre-validation plug-in.  Also, execution in this stage might not be part of the database transaction.<br>Examples:- security checks being performed to verify the calling or logged on user has the correct permissions to perform the intended operation.<br>Note: Ideally, you should only cancel operations using synchronous plug-ins registered in the PreValidation stage. This stage usually occurs outside the main database transaction.
