The first application is a server component that provides user authentication.<br>Step 2: Create a client application<br>The second application is a client component that's used when you're prompted by the CLI for authentication. This client application uses the server application for the actual authentication of the credentials provided by the client.<br>Step 3: Deploy an AKS cluster.<br>Use the az group create command to create a resource group for the AKS cluster.<br>Use the az aks create command to deploy the AKS cluster.<br>Step 4: Create an RBAC binding.<br>Before you use an Azure Active Directory account with an AKS cluster, you must create role-binding or cluster role-binding. Roles define the permissions to grant, and bindings apply them to desired users. These assignments can be applied to a given namespace, or across the entire cluster.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-integration",
