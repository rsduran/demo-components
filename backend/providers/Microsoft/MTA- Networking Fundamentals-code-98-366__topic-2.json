    "answerDescription": "The IpReleaseAddress and IpRenewAddress functions are used to release and renew the current Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) lease. The<br>IpReleaseAddress function releases an IPv4 address previously obtained through DHCP. The IpRenewAddress function renews a lease on an IPv4 address previously obtained through DHCP. It is common to use these two functions together, first releasing the lease with a call to IpReleaseAddress, and then renewing the lease with a call to the IpRenewAddress function.<br>When a DHCP client has previously obtained a DHCP lease and IpReleaseAddress is not called before the IpRenewAddress function, the DHCP client request is sent to the DHCP server that issued the initial DHCP lease. This DHCP server may not available or the DHCP request may fail. When a host has previously obtained a DHCP lease and IpReleaseAddress is called before the IpRenewAddress function, the DHCP client first releases the IP address obtained and sends a<br>DHCP client request for a response from any available DHCP server.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/IpHlp/managing-dhcp-leases-using-ipreleaseaddress-and-iprenewaddress",

    "answerDescription": "Routing Information Protocol (RIP) uses hop count as the metric to rate the value of different routes. The hop count is the number of devices that can be traversed in a route. A directly connected network has a metric of zero; an unreachable network has a metric of 16. This limited metric range makes RIP unsuitable for large networks.<br>The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) sends routing-update messages at regular intervals and when the network topology changes. When a device receives a<br>RIP routing update that includes changes to an entry, the device updates its routing table to reflect the new route. The metric value for the path is increased by 1, and the sender is indicated as the next hop. RIP devices maintain only the best route (the route with the lowest metric value) to a destination. After updating its routing table, the device immediately begins transmitting RIP routing updates to inform other network devices of the change. These updates are sent independently of the regularly scheduled updates that RIP devices send.<br>Summarizing routes in RIP Version 2 improves scalability and efficiency in large networks. Summarizing IP addresses means that there is no entry for child routes<br>(routes that are created for any combination of the individual IP addresses contained within a summary address) in the RIP routing table, reducing the size of the table and allowing the router to handle more routes.<br>It is a stable protocol that uses a distance-vector algorithm to calculate routes.<br>References:<br>https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_rip/configuration/15-mt/irr-15-mt-book/irr-cfg-info-prot.html",
