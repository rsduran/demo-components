Due to the fact that plug-ins run in isolation, the Sandbox service translates into them being short-lived executions that generally would not benefit from KeepAlive. To avoid problems with connecting to external services we recommend disabling KeepAlive within plug-ins. This is done by setting KeepAlive to false.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/best-practices/business-logic/set-keepalive-false-interacting-external-hosts-plugin https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/best-practices/work-with-metadata/retrieve-specific-columns-entity-via-query-apis",
