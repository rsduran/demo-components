This means you do not have to change the connection string for your application after a geo-failover, because connections are automatically routed to the current primary. Whether you use manual or automatic failover activation, a geo-failover switches all secondary databases in the group to the primary role. After the geo-failover is completed, the DNS record is automatically updated to redirect the endpoints to the new region."
