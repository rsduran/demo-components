With SAML single sign-on, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authenticates to the application by using the user's Azure AD account. Azure AD communicates the sign-on information to the application through a connection protocol. You can also map users to specific application roles based on rules you define in your SAML claims. By enabling Application Proxy in addition to SAML SSO, your users will have external access to the application and a seamless SSO experience."
