Create a data connector in Azure Sentinel.\nWhy this is correct: To use data from the LogsWest Log Analytics workspace within your Azure Sentinel deployment in the East US, you need to create a data connector in Azure Sentinel. A data connector allows you to ingest data from various sources, including other Log Analytics workspaces, into Azure Sentinel. Once the data connector is set up, Azure Sentinel can generate alerts based on queries to the LogsWest workspace."

When the conditions defined in the rule are met, an incident is automatically generated.\n\nIncident Rule: An Incident Rule, also known as an Analytics Rule, is responsible for performing analysis on the collected data to identify potential security threats or suspicious activities.

A playbook can help automate and orchestrate your response, and can be set to run automatically when specific alerts or incidents are generated, by being attached to an analytics rule or an automation rule, respectively. It can also be run manually on-demand.\n\nPlaybooks in Azure Sentinel are based on workflows built in Azure Logic Apps, which means that you get all the power, customizability, and built-in templates of Logic Apps.\n\nThus correct answer"

This also ties into time brushing in the advanced section. Similar to regular graphs, the query option must be chosen. This time around, the query will need a \u2018bin\u2019 operator. The bin operator will take a variable and a time scale value and create a series based on the data.\n\n \n\nAn example would be \u2018summarize count() by ProviderName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)'. This is taking a count of ProviderName from the query results and generating a time series that will show the amount of results per day."
