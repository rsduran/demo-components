    "answerDescription": "A: TaskFactory.FromAsync Method -<br>Creates a Task that represents a pair of begin and end methods that conform to the Asynchronous Programming Model pattern. Overloaded.<br>Example:<br>TaskFactory.FromAsync Method (IAsyncResult, Action&lt;IAsyncResult&gt;)<br>Creates a Task that executes an end method action when a specified IAsyncResult completes.<br>B: In many scenarios, it is useful to enable a Task&lt;TResult&gt; to represent an external asynchronous operation. TaskCompletionSource&lt;TResult&gt; is provided for this purpose. It enables the creation of a task that can be handed out to consumers, and those consumers can use the members of the task as they would any other. However, unlike most tasks, the state of a task created by a TaskCompletionSource is controlled explicitly by the methods on TaskCompletionSource. This enables the completion of the external asynchronous operation to be propagated to the underlying Task. The separation also ensures that consumers are not able to transition the state without access to the corresponding TaskCompletionSource.<br>Note:<br><br>System.Threading.Tasks.Task -<br>Represents an asynchronous operation.",

This class supports dynamic binding, which enables you to use standard syntax like sampleObject.sampleMember instead of more complex syntax like sampleObject.GetAttribute(\"sampleMember\").<br>\u2711 You can pass instances of the ExpandoObject class as parameters. Note that these instances are treated as dynamic objects in C# and late-bound objects in<br>Visual Basic. This means that you do not have IntelliSense for object members and you do not receive compiler errors when you call non-existent members. If you call a member that does not exist, an exception occurs.<br>Note:<br>Visual C# 2010 introduces a new type, dynamic. The type is a static type, but an object of type dynamic bypasses static type checking. In most cases, it functions like it has type object. At compile time, an element that is typed as dynamic is assumed to support any operation. Therefore, you do not have to be concerned about whether the object gets its value from a COM API, from a dynamic language such as IronPython, from the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), from reflection, or from somewhere else in the program. However, if the code is not valid, errors are caught at run time.",

This allows tracing code to be compiled into the release version of your application.
