Therefore, as SSO is disabled in the cloud, the Sales department users can access only on-premises applications by using SSO.<br>In the exhibit, directory synchronization is enabled and active.  This means that the on-premises Active Directory user accounts are synchronized to Azure Active<br>Directory user accounts.  If the on-premises Active Directory becomes unavailable, the users can access resources in the cloud by authenticating to Azure Active<br>Directory. They will not be able to access resources on-premises if the on-premises Active Directory becomes unavailable as they will not be able to authenticate to the on-premises Active Directory.",
