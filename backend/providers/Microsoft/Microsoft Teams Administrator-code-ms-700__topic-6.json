To open inbound won't makes sense as you up your network for inbound traffic to every device. That is a big risk and from a a network point, is not required. You would only open inbound ports, if you are publishing something on those ports. in this case, MS is publishing Teams connectivity on the ports and we connecting outbound to them."
