Cognitive Services Contributor\n\nThe Cognitive Services Contributor role provides users with the necessary permissions to manage keys and access controls for Azure Cognitive Services. By assigning this role to the KeyManagers group, they will have the ability to manage keys for all Azure Cognitive Services effectively.\n\nNote that the Security Manager, Cognitive Services User, and Security Administrator roles do not specifically grant the required permissions for managing keys in Azure Cognitive Services. The Cognitive Services Contributor role aligns with the specific requirement stated in the question."
