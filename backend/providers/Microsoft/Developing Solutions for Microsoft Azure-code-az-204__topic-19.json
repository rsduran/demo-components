But if you want to treat 400 as a success, you can provide a telemetry initializer that sets the Success property.\n\nITelemetryProcessor:\nThis technique gives you more direct control over what is included or excluded from the telemetry stream. You can use it in conjunction with Sampling, or separately. To filter telemetry, you write a telemetry processor and register it with the SDK\n\nhttps://github.com/uglide/azure-content/blob/master/articles/application-insights/app-insights-api-filtering-sampling.md"
