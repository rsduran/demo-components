Requirements Management is not a step of all ADM Phases, but rather an ongoing process that ensures that all relevant requirements are elicited, analyzed, prioritized, and addressed throughout the architecture development and transition. Stakeholder engagement is also a continuous activity that involves identifying, communicating, and managing stakeholder expectations and concerns"

Architecture Views, Architecture Viewpoints is the more appropriate answer:\n\nArchitecture Views and Viewpoints are formal tools used within architectural frameworks like TOGAF to communicate architecture in ways that are relevant to different stakeholder groups. They allow architects to address specific stakeholder concerns by presenting different aspects of the architecture. By doing so, architects can extract deeper insights into stakeholders' needs, priorities, and any hidden agendas that might affect the architecture.\nAlternatives and Trade-offs, on the other hand, focus more on evaluating different architectural options and making decisions about compromises. While important, they don\u2019t provide the structured method for presenting information to stakeholders in the same way views and viewpoints do. They are more about decision-making rather than uncovering hidden stakeholder requirements.\nThus, Views and Viewpoints are designed specifically for engaging stakeholders and extracting hidden insights, making A the better choice."
