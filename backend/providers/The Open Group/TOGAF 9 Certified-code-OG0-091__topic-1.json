It is not intended to serve as an implementation guide for practitioners.\n\nWithin the model, the content of the TOGAF document is categorized according to the following four categories:\n\nTOGAF Core consists of the fundamental concepts that form the essence of TOGAF.\nTOGAF Mandated consists of the normative parts of the TOGAF specification. These elements of TOGAF are central to its usage and without them the framework would not be recognizably TOGAF. Strong consideration must be given to these elements when applying TOGAF.\nTOGAF Recommended consists of a pool of resources that are specifically referenced in TOGAF as ways in which the TOGAF Core and Mandated processes can be accomplished (e.g., the SEI Architecture Trade-Off Analysis Method or business scenarios).\nTOGAF Supporting consists of additional resources that are not referenced in the other three TOGAF categories itself but provide valuable assistance."

This content-agnostic approach ensures that the framework is flexible.

It helps identify areas where improvements or changes are needed. In the context of building blocks, a gap analysis allows architects to identify building blocks that have been inadvertently omitted, building blocks that have been intentionally eliminated, building blocks to be carried over from the current architecture, and new building blocks that are needed to achieve the desired target state. However, identifying potential vendors to provide new building blocks is typically not part of a gap analysis. That task would involve market research and vendor evaluation processes rather than the analysis of existing gaps in the architecture."

A viewpoint is used as a template to create a view.\n\nA viewpoint in architecture represents a perspective or viewpoint from which a specific set of concerns or interests of stakeholders can be addressed. It defines the conventions, rules, and languages for creating architectural views that capture and communicate the relevant information to those stakeholders. A viewpoint provides a framework or template that guides the creation of views, which are visual representations or descriptions of specific aspects of the architecture. These views are then used to communicate and analyze the architecture from the intended perspective."

Business Value Assessment Technique.\n\nThe Business Value Assessment Technique is a method used in TOGAF to assess the potential value and benefits that an architecture initiative can deliver to the business. It goes beyond technical considerations and emphasizes the alignment of the architecture with the organization's strategic goals and objectives. The technique involves evaluating the expected business outcomes, financial impacts, risk mitigation, and other factors to determine the value proposition of the architecture. By assessing the business value, organizations can prioritize investments, make informed decisions, and ensure that the architecture initiatives are closely aligned with business priorities and objectives."

This should be done by creating a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix, as shown in Part III, 24.2 Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, &amp; Dependencies Matrix , which will enable the identification of Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) that could potentially address one or more gaps and their associated ABBs.\n\nReview the Phase B, C, and D gap analysis results and consolidate them in a single list. The gaps should be consolidated along with potential solutions to the gaps and dependencies. A recommended technique for determining the dependencies is to use sets of views such as the Business Interaction matrix, the Data Entity/Business Function matrix, and the Application/Function matrix to completely relate elements from different architectural domains."

However, it will often be necessary to modify or extend the ADM to suit specific needs. One of the tasks before applying the ADM is to review its components for applicability, and then tailor them as appropriate to the circumstances of the individual enterprise. This activity may well produce an \"enterprise-specific\" ADM.\n\nOne reason for wanting to adapt the ADM, which it is important to stress, is that the order of the phases in the ADM is to some extent dependent on the maturity of the architecture discipline within the enterprise."

It is important to identify, classify, and mitigate these risks before starting so that they can be tracked throughout the transformation effort.\n\nMitigation is an ongoing effort and often the risk triggers may be outside the scope of the transformation planners (e.g., merger, acquisition) so planners must monitor the transformation context constantly.\n\nIt is also important to note that the Enterprise Architect may identify the risks and mitigate certain ones, but it is within the governance framework that risks have to be first accepted and then managed.\n\nThere are two levels of risk that should be considered, namely:\n\n1. Initial Level of Risk: risk categorization prior to determining and implementing mitigating actions.\n2. Residual Level of Risk: risk categorization after implementation of mitigating actions (if any)."

Strategic Architectures provide an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allow for direction setting at an executive level.\n2. Segment Architectures (see Part I, 3.64 Segment Architecture) provide more detailed operating models for areas within an enterprise. Segment Architectures can be used at the program or portfolio level to organize and operationally align more detailed change activity.\n3. Capability Architectures (see Part I, 3.31 Capability Architecture) show in a more detailed fashion how the enterprise can support a particular unit of capability. Capability Architectures are used to provide an overview of current capability, target capability, and capability increments and allow for individual work packages and projects to be grouped within managed portfolios and programs."

There are many dimensions to change, but by far the most important is the human element. For example, if the enterprise envisages a consolidation of information holdings and a move to a new paradigm such as service orientation for integrated service delivery, then the human resource implications are major. Potentially coupled with a change-averse culture and a narrowly skilled workforce, the most sound and innovative architecture could go nowhere.\n\nUnderstanding the readiness of the organization to accept change, identifying the issues, and then dealing with them in the Implementation and Migration Plans is key to successful architecture transformation in Phases E and F. This will be a joint effort between corporate (especially human resources) staff, lines of business, and IT planners."

This content-agnostic approach ensures that the framework is flexible. The processes are typically independent of the content and implement a proven best practice approach to active governance."

Strategic Architectures provide an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allow for direction setting at an executive level.\n2. \"Segment Architectures\" (see Part I, 3.64 Segment Architecture) provide more detailed operating models for areas within an enterprise. Segment Architectures can be used at the program or portfolio level to organize and operationally align more detailed change activity.\n3. \"Capability Architectures\" (see Part I, 3.31 Capability Architecture) show in a more detailed fashion how the enterprise can support a particular unit of capability. Capability Architectures are used to provide an overview of current capability, target capability, and capability increments and allow for individual work packages and projects to be grouped within managed portfolios and programs."

In these circumstances, it is necessary for implementation projects to either deviate from the suggested architectural approach or to request scope extensions. Additionally, external factors - such as market factors, changes in business strategy, and new technology opportunities - may open up opportunities to extend and refine the architecture.\n\nIn these circumstances, a Change Request \"may be submitted in order to kick-start a further cycle of architecture work.\""

Due to the sheer volume and the diverse stakeholder needs throughout an entire enterprise, the Architecture Landscape is divided into three levels of granularity:\n\n1. *Strategic Architectures* show a long-term summary view of the entire enterprise. Strategic Architectures provide an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allow for direction setting at an executive level.\n2. *Segment Architectures*  provide more detailed operating models for areas within an enterprise. Segment Architectures can be used at the program or portfolio level to organize and operationally align more detailed change activity.\n3. *Capability Architectures* show in a more detailed fashion how the enterprise can support a particular unit of capability. Capability Architectures are used to provide an overview of current capability, target capability, and capability increments and allow for individual work packages and projects to be grouped within managed portfolios and programs."

Strategic Architectures provide an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allow for direction setting at an executive level.\n2.

Segment Architectures can be used at the program or portfolio level to organize and operationally align more detailed change activity.\n3. Capability Architectures (see Part I, 3.31 Capability Architecture) show in a more detailed fashion how the enterprise can support a particular unit of capability. Capability Architectures are used to provide an overview of current capability, target capability, and capability increments and allow for individual work packages and projects to be grouped within managed portfolios and programs."

It is business-driven and business-led and combines the requisite efforts of all lines of business to achieve the desired capability. Capability-based planning accommodates most, if not all, of the corporate business models and is especially useful in organizations where a latent capability to respond (e.g., an emergency preparedness unit) is required and the same resources are involved in multiple capabilities. Often the need for these capabilities are discovered and refined using business scenarios."
