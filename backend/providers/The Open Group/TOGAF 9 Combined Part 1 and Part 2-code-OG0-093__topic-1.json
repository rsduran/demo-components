This should be done by creating a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix, as shown in Part III, 24.2 Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, &amp; Dependencies Matrix , which will enable the identification of Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) that could potentially address one or more gaps and their associated ABBs.\n\nReview the Phase B, C, and D gap analysis results and consolidate them in a single list.

The way in which assets and capabilities are assembled into building blocks will vary widely between individual architectures. Every organization must decide for itself what arrangement of building blocks works best for it. A good choice of building blocks can lead to improvements in legacy system integration, interoperability, and flexibility in the creation of new systems and applications."

Each of these plants supplies a different manufacturer that builds and sells complete systems. The turbine blades are custom engineered to meet each manufacturer's design specifications.<br>Until recently, most turbine blades were fabricated manually using molded fiber-reinforced plastics. However, recent improvements in composite materials, coupled with enhanced automated methods for precision application of materials during the molding process, have led to significant reduction in weight, increase in strength, and greatly improved blade longevity. The company has pioneered the development of a proprietary automated process for continuous extrusion of the turbine blades. Patents have been filed to protect the process, but certain trade secrets must be closely guarded.<br>The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture organization that is supported by a cross-functional Architecture Review Board. The Chief Information Officer and the Chief Operating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.<br>The company has used T0GAF and its Architecture Development Method (ADM) to develop its automated manufacturing processes and systems that are used to design, manufacture, and test the blade assemblies. They have adapted their Enterprise Architecture to closely follow the TOGAF 9 framework. All of the company's enterprise architects have been trained and certified on TOGAF 9. Recently, an architecture project was completed that defined a standard approach for controlling the Automated Test System that is used at each plant to perform final quality assurance tests on each completed blade assembly. The<br>Manufacturing Architecture Board approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.<br>An Architecture Contract was developed that detailed the work needed to implement and deploy the new Automated Test System controller. The Chief Engineer, sponsor of the activity, has expressed concern that a uniform process be employed at each site to ensure consistency.<br><br>Refer to the Scenario -<br>You are the Lead Architect for this activity.<br>You have been asked to recommend the best approach to adopt to address the Chief Engineer's concern.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

Over the course of this contract, the company has grown rapidly by acquisition and has inherited numerous different procurement processes and related IT systems. The company is moving aggressively to consolidate and reduce redundant procurement processes and systems. The CEO has announced that the company will seek to leverage higher volume discounts and lower related IT support costs by instituting a preferred supplier program.<br>To achieve this goal, the company needs to define Baseline and Target Architectures. These architectures must address key stakeholders' concerns such as:<br>1. What groups of people should be involved in procurement-related business processes?<br>2. What current applications do those groups use?<br>3. Which procurement-related business processes are supported by zero, one, or many existing applications?<br>4. What are the overall lifetimes of the Request for Proposal and Purchase Order business objects? What non-procurement applications will need to be integrated with any new procurement applications?<br>5. What data will need to be shared?<br>At present, there are no particularly useful architectural assets related to this initiative, so all assets need to be acquired and customized or created from scratch.<br>The company prefers to implement existing package applications from systems vendors with little customization.<br>The architecture development project has just completed its Architecture Context iteration cycle and is about to begin the Architecture Definition iteration cycle.<br>The company is using TOGAF for its internal Enterprise Architecture activities.

However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, the company has begun implementing a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business.<br>The Corporate Board is concerned that the new ERP system must be able to manage and safeguard customer information in a manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services offered to clients and trading partners.<br>The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the ERP implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Review Board to oversee and govern the architecture. The company has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture program.

Each of these plants has been operating its own planning and production scheduling systems, as well as custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.<br>The company is implementing lean manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve the efficiency of all of its production operations. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.<br>The company Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9. At a recent meeting, the Architecture Review Board approved a Request for Architecture Work from the Chief<br>Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations who is the project sponsor. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.<br>The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits.

Results for the last two quarters have shown that Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and the customer retention (Churn) rate have fallen below the industry average.<br>The Corporate Marketing group has published some new findings about customer satisfaction. The customers appear to be switching to AirLight, a competitor, because of superior customer service. The company actually has better coverage in nearly all markets than AirLight, and good roaming agreements that keep rates low for business travelers. But, customer satisfaction has remained low. The Business Strategy group and the Enterprise Architecture group have conducted a high-level project to develop the enterprise-wide strategic plan.<br>They have developed a business scenario which contains a good conceptual model of what needs to be done, and also identifies the key requirements. This was used in preparing the proposal presented to the Executive Council and the Corporate Board. The planning for the program has been underway for several months.<br>The company has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture. The Corporate Board has approved funding for a multi-million Euro conversion to transition to a packaged Customer Service System. It is anticipated that the overall program will take five years to complete, but there are some tactical projects that can commence immediately to address the situation.<br>The Executive Council has stated that the program should define specific initiatives to enable each regional business unit to create an implementation of the<br>Customer Service System. The implementation must meet the needs of the business unit and still provide the information needed to enable major improvements to the customer.<br><br>Refer to the Scenario -<br>You are serving as the Lead Architect for the Performance and Integrity project of the Customer Service System program.<br>The project has been chartered to address the architecture(s) required to support the Customer Service System from an infrastructure perspective. At the present time, the project team is conducting an architecture development project that is focused on the customer self-service capability, which was defined as part of the earlier strategic planning activities. This capability will enable customers to access their accounts, pay bills, request account reviews, and provision services from any web-enabled device.<br>The project team has gathered information about the self-service capability, developed a business scenario, and used the results to define an Architecture Vision for achieving the capability.<br>You have been asked to recommend the course of action to complete the project.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

The strategic architecture called for the consolidation of multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications that have been operating independently in several of the divisions' production facilities. The goal is to replace the functionality of the existing applications with a new ERP product running as a single instance in the company's primary data center.<br>The company has a mature enterprise architecture practice and uses TOGAF 9 for the basis of its architecture framework. In addition to the EA program, the company has a number of management frameworks in use, including business planning, portfolio/project management, and operations management. The EA program is sponsored by the CIO.<br>Each division has completed the Architecture Definition documentation required to tailor and configure the environment to meet its own specific manufacturing requirements.<br>The enterprise architects have analyzed the key corporate change attributes and implementation constraints. A consolidated gap analysis has been completed which has identified the gaps across the Business, Data, Application, and Technology domains. Based on the results of the gap analysis, the architects have reviewed the requirements, dependencies and interoperability requirements needed to integrate the new ERP environment into the existing environment. The architects have completed the Business Transformation Readiness Assessment started in Phase A. Based on all of these factors they have produced a risk assessment.<br>Because of the risks posed by the complexity of the current environment, it has been determined that a phased approach is needed to implement the target architectures. The overall implementation process is estimated to take several years.<br><br>Refer to the Scenario -<br>The Implementation and Migration Plan v0.l, the draft Architecture Roadmap, and the Capability Assessment deliverables are now complete. You have been asked to recommend the next steps to prepare the final Implementation and Migration Plan.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

The company has three manufacturing facilities, one in North America, one in Asia, and one in Europe. Each of these facilities supplies the power industry in its region.<br>The company recognizes that the long-term technical potential of wind energy can address the current global dependency on carbon fuels. In order to do so this will require wind turbines to be installed over large areas of higher wind resources. In particular offshore wind farms can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines.<br>The research arm of the company has pioneered the development of an offshore wind turbine design, with an improved turbine blade and power system, that will produce up to 20% more energy. This will allow the production of significantly more saleable energy. This new design is ready to go into production.<br>The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture practice supported by a cross-functional Architecture Board and uses the TOGAF standard. The Chief<br>Information Officer and the Chief Operating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.<br>As part of putting the new design into production, a pilot architecture project has defined an updated standard approach for controlling the automated test systems used to perform final quality assurance to perform final quality assurance. The Architecture Board approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.<br>Architecture Contracts have been developed that detail the work needed to implement and deploy the new Automated Test System controller for each location.<br>The Chief Engineer, sponsor of the activity, has expressed concern that a uniform process be employed at each location to ensure consistency.<br><br>Refer to the Scenario -<br>You have been asked to recommend the best approach to address the Chief Engineer's concern.<br>Based on the TOGAF standard, Version 9.2, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a single enterprise-wide application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The application will be used by all business units and accessed by suppliers through well defined interfaces.<br>The Corporate Board is concerned that the new application must be able to manage and safeguard confidential customer information in a secure manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services in cooperation with its trading partners.<br>The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Board to oversee and govern the architecture.

During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.<br>The Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9.<br>At a recent meeting, the Architecture Board approved a Request for Architecture Work sponsored by the Chief Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.<br>The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits.

The inability to share information has resulted in lost opportunities to leverage the synergies that should have been possible as a result of the merger. At present, each division maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, and claims information, each division has different ways of defining these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a common web portal, contact center software suite, and document management system. Also the company has selected a single enterprise-wide customer relationship management (CRM) application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the divisions. The application will be used by each of the divisions and accessed by third party partners through well defined interfaces.<br>The Corporate Board is concerned that the new application must be able to manage and safeguard confidential customer information in a secure manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services in cooperation with its partners.<br>The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the implementation team and the migration teams in each division. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Board to oversee and govern the architecture. The company has an existing team of security architects.<br>TOGAF 9 has been selected as the core framework for use for the Enterprise Architecture program.

The increasingly competitive business environment has compelled the firm to improve its business capability to be more responsive to the needs of industrial customers. To support this capability, the firm has decided to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will enable it to better coordinate its manufacturing capacity to match the demands for its products across all plants. In addition, there are also new European regulations coming into force to which their manufacturing processes must conform in the next six months.<br>As part of the implementation process, the Enterprise Architecture (EA) department has begun to implement an architecture process based on TOGAF 9.

Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a single enterprise-wide application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The application will be used by all business units and accessed by suppliers through well defined interfaces.<br><br>Refer to the Scenario -<br>As part of the process for establishing the Enterprise Architecture department, you are developing a set of architecture principles to guide the activities.<br>You need to specify the best approach for this work.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

The company is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio with manufacturing plants across the United States, Brazil, Germany, Japan and South Korea. Each of these plants has been operating its own planning and production scheduling systems, as well as custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.<br>The company is implementing lean manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve the efficiency of all of its production operations. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.<br>The Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9.<br>At a recent meeting, the Architecture Board approved a Request for Architecture Work sponsored by the Chief Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.<br>The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits. Some of the plant managers have expressed concern about the security and reliability of diving their planning and production scheduling from a remote centralized system. The Chief Engineer wants to know how these concerns can be addressed.<br><br>Refer to the Scenario -<br>During the initial meeting of the Common ERP Deployment architecture project team, a number of alternative recommendations for how to proceed are put forward by members of the team.<br>You have been asked to select the most appropriate recommendation to ensure that the team evaluates different approaches to the problem and clarifies the requirements for the architecture.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

The chain manages over 500 hotels across North America and<br>Canada, with another 230 hotels internationally in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Unlike other hotel chains, which are often a mix of company-owned and franchised units, each hotel in the chain is an independently owned and operated franchise. Many of the hotels use the same internal IT systems that they used before they joined the franchise. Until recently, the only requirement that has been placed on each hotel is that they use a standard financial reporting system to report their financial results to the headquarters on a weekly basis.<br>The CEO of the chain has stated his concerns about the inefficiencies of the current approach and identified the need to change. He has defined a new strategic vision that will enhance the business by providing its franchisees new support services including worldwide reservations, global, national and regional marketing as well as consolidated financial, logistics, and yield management. This strategy is part of the long-term commitment to enhance the brand image and drive superior revenue for the chain. He has also stated that he expects improved financial results by the end of the current fiscal year.<br>These changes will provide the chain with improved utilization of its capacity and more efficient operations. The addition of a corporate-wide data warehouse will provide analytics that will enable the marketing group to improve its ability to target advertising into key national and regional markets to improve yields.<br>The chain has a mature enterprise architecture practice based in its headquarters and uses TOGAF 9 as the method and guiding framework. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity.<br>In planning this change, the Chief Architect engaged the services of a well-known consulting firm that specializes in business strategy. An initial study has been conducted to identify the strategic changes needed to implement the CEO's vision.

Once the new repository content has been implemented, on- demand queries can be used to generate a customized governance stakeholder view that isolates the artifacts and data needed to assess measurement for any particular service. If this view is found to be inadequate for the governance concerns, the service models within those artifacts can be expanded.",

By using this extension, the service model is no longer constrained by what is expected in typical business service definitions, allowing more flexibility for adding customized models to support the more stringent measurement requirements. The services extension can also be used to map terminology between the business services and the application components.",

To accommodate the proper development of this, a Communications Engineering view should be created from the infrastructure extension models of the TOGAF Content Metamodel. This view will allow architects to align the required performance measurement communications across the system."

The agency was formed by consolidating several smaller government agencies. The agency has established an Enterprise Architecture practice based on TOGAF 9. The CIO is the executive sponsor and has appointed an EA steering team to oversee the practice.<br>There has been a considerable increase in security requirements and immigration service requests in recent years, which have expanded the scope and size of the operations of the agency. As a result, the existing Information Technology architecture no longer meets the required service levels. A significant Enterprise<br>Architecture (EA) initiative is in progress with the opal to improve customer responsiveness and satisfaction, and improve the overall operational efficiency of the agency.<br>The current EA staff members were internal appointments based on a request from the EA steering team to supply a number of suitable individuals for the EA effort. Collectively, they possess a broad range of IT and business analysis skills. However, the CIO has expressed concern about the diverse range of experience within the team. There is concern that the EA staff may be lacking in some of the critical skills that are required to properly conduct EA activities. It had been assumed that any EA-related skill gaps would be overcome by on-the-job mentoring from the senior members of the EA staff. Each architect was expected to attend a TOGAF training course and participate in other skill development activities.<br>A recent review of the EA program revealed that many EA staff members, despite attending multi-day training courses, were not proficient in analyzing or creating the models and artifacts required for their assigned architecture projects. Stakeholders have observed errors and inconsistencies in artifacts and deliverables being submitted for review.<br>Refer to the Scenario -<br>The CIO has asked you to recommend a professional development plan for the EA staff in order to address the findings raised in the recent review.<br>Based on TOGAF, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

        "content": "Correct Answer \n\nReference :\nThe approach is based on classifying required architectural changes into one of three categories:\n\nSimplification change: a simplification change can normally be handled via change management techniques\nIncremental change: an incremental change may be capable of being handled via change management techniques, or it may require partial re-architecting, depending on the nature of the change (see 15.5.3 Guidelines for Maintenance versus Architecture Redesign for guidelines)\nRe-architecting change: a re-architecting change requires putting the whole architecture through the architecture development cycle again\nAnother way of looking at these three choices is to say that a simplification change to an architecture is often driven by a requirement to reduce investment; an incremental change is driven by a requirement to derive additional value from existing investment; and a re-architecting change is driven by a requirement to increase investment in order to create new value for exploitation."

The impact to the business and consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: \"How does this affect me?\".

The aim should always be to seek the highest level of commonality and focus on scalable and re-usable modules in order to maximize re-use at the enterprise level."

The stores operate 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and use cloud-based point-of-sale<br>(POS) technology to manage their sales and inventory. Cloud-based POS systems store all user data, including sales and inventory in a remote server.<br>The cloud-based systems collect real-time data to support ordering and product selection decisions including the tailoring of product assortment based on sales history, customer demographics as well as the next day's weather forecast. In many cases, several stores are located in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible. The stores also act as self-service delivery locations for a large online retailer which further increases the number of potential customers entering the stores.<br>An Enterprise Architecture practice exists within the company, with the CEO and CIO as joint sponsors. They have decided to adopt TOGAF standard within the practice and the first project is to restructure the Enterprise Architecture so that it can better support the existing environment and accommodate future changes of strategy within the company.<br>The CIO has stated that the following issues need to be addressed in the restructuring:<br>\u2711 They need to address problems with data quality and inconsistent data in order to support better decision making and analysis.<br>\u2711 The architecture should focus on the needs of the business, not technology<br>\u2711 To remain competitive, new products and promotions must undergo market trials and if these are successful, deployed across the retail chain.

The company has to satisfy the regulatory requirements of each of the countries it operates in.<br>The downstream business generates a third of the company's profits worldwide and includes more than 30,000 petrol stations and various oil refineries. In some countries it also includes oil refining, a retail petrol station network, lubricants manufacture and marketing, industrial fuel and lubricants sales. The practice for the downstream business has been to operate locally, managed by local \"operating companies\".<br>The Governing Board is concerned about the risk posed by operating in this complex global environment with a large part of the downstream business represented by local operating companies. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) to be responsible for overseeing and managing compliance issues for the corporation. The CCO reports directly to the CEO.<br>The CCO has approved the expenditure of resources to establish an Enterprise Architecture program, and has mandated the use of the TOGAF standard as the framework. He has requested to be informed about the status of downstream operations that could impact regulatory compliance. He also wants the corporate legal staff and auditors to analyze all proposed new downstream operations to ensure that they are within the legal guidelines for each country. In addition, the local operating companies should be able to see that the architecture is appropriate for their needs.<br>The architecture project team has worked with the sponsor to complete a detailed Request for Architecture Work providing the high level project description.

These provide real-time, highly secure communication of voice, video, and message data to remote locations around the world. The agency has recently received information from intelligence sources that the current encryption protocols may no longer be secure. In response, a program is underway to upgrade the systems.<br>The agency has an established Enterprise Architecture (EA) capability based on the TOGAF standard. The Executive Director of the agency is the sponsor of the<br>EA capability.<br>Since reliable, high-performance, and secure communications are essential to preserving national security, the Executive Director has placed more stringent requirements for the architecture of the upgraded systems. It must be able to provide assurance and verification of specific performance measures on the key services that are most crucial for system operation. Focusing on these service-level details and specific measurements, will allow stricter requirements to be enforced in service contracts. It will also provide a high degree of assurance that necessary performance is being delivered and that notifications will occur if any critical service fails to perform as required.<br>A portion of the program budget has been allocated to context a review of the EA. The scope of the review is to evaluate the processes, content and governance of the EA capability to ensure that the higher target performance and service levels required by the upgraded system can be achieved.<br>The Chief Architect has noted that the core EA artifacts that have been in use are not able to describe these new capabilities. The artifacts do not have explicit provisions for defining the in-depth measurement requirements regarding specific services required for the system. She has learned that certain services within the current system have service measurement implementations that match some of the new requirements, but they are only used in a few areas.<br>Recent EA efforts at another national agency have produced generalized high-performance communication system models to realize similar requirements in a critical defense system involving secure communications. It is possible that these models may be useful for the upgrade program.<br>Refer to the Scenario -<br>[Note: You may need to refer to the Content Metamodel chapter, section 30.4 (located in Part IV) of the reference text in order to answer this question.]<br>You have been asked to make recommendations for tailoring the Architecture Content Metamodel to accommodate the requirements of the upgraded system.<br>Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

The chain includes over 15,000 retail outlets throughout the Asia-Pacific region.<br>Each store in the chain is an independently owned and operated franchise. The stores operate 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Many of the stores have been with the franchise for more than 10 years and still use the original IT systems deployed at that time.<br>The CEO of the chain has stated his concerns about the inefficiencies of the current systems and identified the need to change. He has defined a new strategic vision that will enhance the business by providing its franchisees new services to help them compete with other retail outlets and online retailers. This strategy is part of the long-term commitment to enhance the brand image and increase revenue for the chain. He has also stated that he expects improved financial results by the end of the current fiscal year.<br>These changes will provide the chain with improved products, and more efficient operations. The stores will also act as delivery and return locations for a large online retailer which will further increase the number of potential customers. The addition of a corporate-wide data warehouse will provide analytics that will enable the marketing group to improve its ability to target advertising and new products to specific regions.<br>The chain has a mature Enterprise Architecture practice based in its headquarters and uses the TOGAF standard as the method and guiding framework. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity.<br>The Chief Architect engaged the services of a leading consulting firm that specializes in business strategy. An initial study has been conducted to identify the strategic changes needed to implement the CEO's vision.

    "body": "Scenario -<br>Your role is consultant to the Lead Architect within a company that manufactures electromechanical devices. The company is organized as independent operational divisions.<br>The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture (EA) practice and uses the TOGAF standard for the basis of its architecture framework. In addition to the EA program, the company has a number of management frameworks in use, including business planning, portfolio/project management, and operations management. The EA program is sponsored by the CIO.<br>A strategic architecture has been approved that includes consolidation of multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications that have been operating in several of the divisions' production facilities. The goal is to replace the functionality of the existing applications with a new ERP product running as a single instance in the company's primary data center.<br>Each division has completed the Architecture Definition documentation required to tailor and configure the environment to meet its own specific manufacturing requirements.<br>The enterprise architects have analyzed the key corporate change attributes and implementation constraints. A consolidated gap analysis has been completed which has identified the gaps across the Business, Data, Application, and Technology domains.<br>Using the results of the gap analysis, the architects have reviewed the requirements, dependencies and interoperability requirements needed to integrate the new<br>ERP environment into the existing environment. The architects have completed the Business Transformation Readiness Assessment started in Phase A. Based on all of these factors they have produced a risk assessment.<br>The implementation process is estimated to take four years. Because of the risks posed by the complexity of the current environment, a phased approach is needed to implement the target architectures. The Implementation and Migration Plan v0.1, the draft Architecture Roadmap, and the Capability Assessment deliverables are now complete.<br>Refer to the Scenario.<br>You have been asked to recommend the next steps to prepare the final Implementation and Migration Plan.<br>Based on the TOGAF standard, Version 9.2, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",
