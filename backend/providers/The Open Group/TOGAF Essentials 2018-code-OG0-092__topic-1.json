    "body": "Scenario: Rollins Manufacturing -<br>Rollins Manufacturing is a major supplier in the automotive industry, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio with manufacturing plants in Chicago, Sao Paulo, Stuttgart,<br>Yokohama, and Seoul. Each of these plants has been operating its own Manufacturing Requirements Planning (MRPII) system, production scheduling, and custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.<br>Rollins is implementing lean manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve the efficiency of all of its production operations. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current MRPII and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.<br>The Rollins Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9.At a recent meeting, the Architecture Review Board approved a Request for Architecture Work from the Chief<br>Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations who is the project sponsor. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.<br>The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits. Some of the plant managers have expressed concern about the security and reliability of driving their MRPII and production scheduling from a central system located in Cleveland. The Chief Engineer wants to know how these concerns can be addressed.<br>You are serving as the Lead Enterprise Architect for the Common ERP Deployment architecture project.<br>One of the earliest initiatives in the Enterprise Architecture program at Rollins was the definition of a set of IT principles and architecture principles that are well aligned with the overall enterprise principles. These now need to be updated to address the concerns raised.<br>You have been asked to select a set of principles most appropriate for guiding the team to define a robust solution.<br>[Note: You should assume that Rollins has adopted the example set of principles that are listed and defined in TOGAF 9, Section 23.6.]<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

    "body": "Scenario: Global Mobile 1 -<br>Global Mobile is a mobile telecommunications company formed through a series of mergers and acquisitions. They are yet to fully integrate the customer service systems for the most recent acquisitions, and as result, customer service has been a major concern for the Chief Technology Officer.<br>Results for the last two quarters have shown that Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and the customer retention (Churn) rate have fallen below the industry average. The Corporate Marketing group has published some new findings about customer satisfaction. The customers appear to be switching to Air Light, a competitor, because of superior customer service. Global Mobile actually has better coverage in nearly all markets than Air Light, and good roaming agreements that keep rates low for business travelers. But, customer satisfaction has remained low.<br>The Business Strategy group and the Enterprise Architecture group have conducted a high-level project to develop the enterprise-wide strategic plan. They have developed a business scenario which contains a good conceptual model of what needs to be done, and also identifies the key requirements. This was used in preparing the proposal presented to the Executive Council and the Corporate Board.<br>The planning for the program has been underway for several months. Global Mobile has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture.<br>The Corporate Board has approved funding for a multi-million Euro conversion to transition to a packaged Customer Service System. It is anticipated that the overall program will take five years to complete, but there are some tactical projects that can commence immediately to address the situation. The Corporate<br>Board has placed one additional major constraint on the program. In addition to achieving the business outcomes directly related to improving overall customer service within each business unit, the Corporate Board expects the Target Architecture to produce an additional saving of at least 30% over current operating costs through energy efficiency initiatives, virtualization of servers and workstations, and expanded telecommuting and desk-sharing. This Green initiative is intended to become a model for future investments at all company facilities worldwide.<br>You have been engaged as a consultant to advise the Chief Architect on the best ways to approach to the implementation planning activities for this significant business transformation.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?

However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, AGEX has begun implementing a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The Corporate Board is concerned that the new ERP system must be able to manage and safeguard customer information in a manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services offered to clients and trading partners.<br>The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the ERP implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process.

Zephyr has manufacturing facilities located in Palm Springs, California, Omaha, Nebraska, and Winnipeg, Ontario. Each of these plants supplies a different manufacturer that builds and sells complete systems. The turbine blades are custom engineered to meet each manufacturers design specifications.<br>Until recently, most turbine blades were fabricated manually using molded fiber-reinforced plastics. However, recent improvements in composite materials, coupled with enhanced automated methods for precision application of materials during the molding process, have led to significant reduction in weight, increase in strength, and greatly improved blade longevity. Zephyr has pioneered the development of a proprietary automated process for continuous extrusion of the turbine blades. Patents have been filed to protect the process, but certain trade secrets must be closely guarded.<br>Zephyr has a mature Enterprise Architecture organization that is supported by a cross-functional Architecture Review Board. The Chief Information Officer and the<br>Chief Operating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.<br>Zephyr has used TOGAF and its Architecture Development Method (ADM) to develop its automated manufacturing processes and systems that are used to design, manufacture, and test the blade assemblies. They have recently updated to TOGAF 9 and have adapted the Zephyr Enterprise Architecture to closely follow the TOGAF 9 framework. All of Zephyrs IT architects have been trained and certified on TOGAF 9.Recently, an architecture project was completed that defined a standard approach for controlling the Automated Test System that is used at each plant to perform final quality assurance tests on each completed blade assembly. The Manufacturing Architecture Board approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.<br>An Architecture Contract was developed that detailed the work needed to implement and deploy the new Automated Test System controller. The Chief Engineer, sponsor of the activity, has expressed concern that a uniform process be employed at each site to ensure consistency.<br>You are the Lead Architect for this activity.<br>You have been asked to recommend the best approach to adopt to address the Chief Engineer's concern.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

Florian also wants to define new business models that are profitable while reducing their impact on the environment. Florian management is deeply committed to ensuring that the company is a world leader in socially responsible seed development with a business strategy that focuses on profitability through environmentally friendly operating processes.<br>Florians international operations are subject to various legal and regulatory requirements. In areas such as genetically modified seeds, governmental controls are strictly enforced and compliance is critical. Recently a competitor was heavily fined for violating the regulations in a country where it was developing pest-resistant seeds.<br>The Governing Board is concerned, and as a result has approved the expenditure of resources to establish an Enterprise Architecture program. They have requested to be informed about the status of projects that could impact regulatory compliance. They also want to enable the corporate legal staff and auditors to analyze proposed architectures to ensure that they are within the legal guidelines for a given location. In addition, the research organization should be able to see that the architecture is appropriate for its needs.<br>TOGAF 9 has been mandated as the guiding framework for the development and evolution of the Enterprise Architecture practice.<br>Florian management has engaged you as the Lead Consultant to assess the current situation.<br>You have been asked to recommend an approach that would enable the development of an architecture that addresses the needs of all these parties.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

The lack of a target architecture upfront can result in inefficiencies, delays in decision making, and difficulties in achieving the desired outcomes.\n\nTOGAF 18.4 Says \"Target First: This process is suitable when a target state is agreed at a high level and where the enterprise wishes to effectively transition to the target model.\""

Zephyr has manufacturing facilities located in Palm Springs, California, Omaha, Nebraska, and Winnipeg, Ontario. Each of these plants supplies a different manufacturer that builds and sells complete systems. The turbine blades are custom engineered to meet each manufacturers design specifications.<br>Until recently, most turbine blades were fabricated manually using molded fiber-reinforced plastics. However, recent improvements in composite materials, coupled with enhanced automated methods for precision application of materials during the molding process, have led to significant reduction in weight, increase in strength, and greatly improved blade longevity. Zephyr has pioneered the development of a proprietary automated process for continuous extrusion of the turbine blades. Patents have been filed to protect the process, but certain trade secrets must be closely guarded.<br>Zephyr has a mature Enterprise Architecture organization that is supported by a cross-functional Architecture Review Board. The Chief Information Officer and the<br>Chief Operating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.<br>Zephyr has used TOGAF and its Architecture Development Method (ADM) to develop its automated manufacturing processes and systems that are used to design, manufacture, and test the blade assemblies. They have recently updated to TOGAF 9 and have adapted the Zephyr Enterprise Architecture to closely follow the TOGAF 9 framework. All of Zephyrs IT architects have been trained and certified on TOGAF 9.Recently, an architecture project was completed that defined a standard approach for controlling the Automated Test System that is used at each plant to perform final quality assurance tests on each completed blade assembly. The Manufacturing Architecture Board approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.<br>An Architecture Contract was developed that detailed the work needed to implement and deploy the new Automated Test System controller.

    "body": "Scenario: Rollins Manufacturing -<br>Rollins Manufacturing is a major supplier in the automotive industry, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio with manufacturing plants in Chicago, Sao Paulo, Stuttgart,<br>Yokohama, and Seoul. Each of these plants has been operating its own Manufacturing Requirements Planning (MRPII) system, production scheduling, and custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.<br>Rollins is implementing lean manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve the efficiency of all of its production operations. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current MRPII and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.<br>The Rollins Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9.At a recent meeting, the Architecture Review Board approved a Request for Architecture Work from the Chief<br>Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations who is the project sponsor. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.<br>The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits. Some of the plant managers have expressed concern about the security and reliability of driving their MRPII and production scheduling from a central system located in Cleveland. The Chief Engineer wants to know how these concerns can be addressed.<br>You are serving as the Lead Enterprise Architect of the newly-formed Common ERP Deployment architecture project team.<br>As the Common ERP Deployment architecture project team assembles for its initial meeting, many of the participants have voiced concerns about the sweeping scope of the initiative. Others are confident that they know a solution that will work. During the meeting, a number of alternative recommendations for how to proceed are put forward by members of the team.<br>You have been asked to select the most appropriate recommendation to ensure that the team evaluates different approaches to the problem and clarifies the requirements for the architecture.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

They are yet to fully integrate the customer service systems for the most recent acquisitions, and as result, customer service has been a major concern for the Chief Technology Officer.<br>Results for the last two quarters have shown that Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and the customer retention (Churn) rate have fallen below the industry average. The Corporate Marketing group has published some new finding about customer satisfaction. The customers appear to be switching to Air Light, a competitor, because of superior customer service. WorldwideMobile actually has better coverage in nearly all markets than Air Light, and good roaming agreement that keep rates low for business travellers. But customer satisfaction has remained low.<br>The Business Strategy group and the Enterprise Architecture group have conducted a high-level project to develop the enterprise-wide strategic plan. They have developed a business scenario which contains a good conceptual model of what needs to be done and also identifies the key requirements. This was used in preparing the proposal presented to the Executive Council and the Corporate Board.<br>The planning for the program has been underway for several months. WorldwideMobile has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture.<br>The Corporate Board has approved funding for a multi-million Euro conversion to transition to a packaged Customer Service System. It is anticipated that the overall program will take five years to complete, but there are some tactical projects that can commence immediately to address the situation. The Executive<br>Council has stated that the program should define specific initiatives to enable each regional business units to create an implementation of the Customer Service<br>System. The implementation must meet the needs of the business unit and still provide the information needed to enable major improvements to the customer.<br>You are serving as the Lead Architect for the Performance and Integrity project of the Customer Service System program.<br>The project has been chartered to address the architecture(s) required to support the Customer Service System from an infrastructure perspective. At present time, the project team is conducting an architecture development project that is focused on the customer self service capability, which was defined as part of the earlier strategic planning activities. This capability will enable customers to access their accounts, pay bills, request account reviews, and provision services from any web-enabled device.<br>The project team has gathered information about the self-service capability, developed a business scenario, and used the results to define an Architecture Vision for achieving the capability.<br>You have been asked to recommend the course of action to complete the project.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is best answer?<br>",

However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, AGEX has begun implementing a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The Corporate Board is concerned that the new ERP system must be able to manage and safeguard customer information in a manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services offered to clients and trading partners.<br>The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the ERP implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Review Board to oversee and govern the architecture.<br>After reviewing the available alternatives, and based on recommendations from the ERP vendor, AGEX has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise<br>Architecture program.<br>The CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.<br>You are serving as the Chief Architect.<br>As part of the process for establishing the Enterprise Architecture department, you have decided to create a set of principles to guide the activities.<br>You have been asked to recommend the best approach for this work.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

However, recent improvements in composite materials, coupled with enhanced automated methods for precision application of materials during the molding process, have led to significant reduction in weight, increase in strength, and improved blade longevity. The company has pioneered the development of a proprietary automated process for continuous extrusion of the turbine blades. Patents have been filed to protect the process, but certain trade secrets must be closely guarded.<br>The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture organization that is supported by a cross-functional Architecture Board. The Chief Information Officer and the<br>Chief Operating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.<br>TOGAF 9 and its Architecture Development Method (ADM) are used to develop the automated manufacturing processes and systems that are used to design, manufacture, and test the blade assemblies.<br>Recently, a pilot architecture project was completed at a single location that defined a standard approach for controlling the Automated Test System that is used at each plant to perform final quality assurance tests on each completed blade assembly. The Architecture Board approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.<br>Architecture Contracts have been developed that detail the work needed to implement and deploy the new Automated Test System controller for each location.<br>The Chief Engineer, sponsor of the activity, has expressed concern that a uniform process be employed at each location to ensure consistency.<br>You have been asked to recommend the best approach to address the Chief Engineer's concern.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

    "body": "Scenario:<br>You are serving as the Chief Architect for a large, global commodities trading company which has been growing rapidly through a series of acquisitions.<br>Each business is performing well in its markets. However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a single enterprise-wide application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The application will be used by all business units and accessed by suppliers through well defined interfaces.<br>The Corporate Board is concerned that the new application must be able to manage and safeguard confidential customer information in a secure manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services in cooperation with its trading partners.<br>The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Board to oversee and govern the architecture. The company has an existing team of security architects.<br>TOGAF 9 has been selected for use for the Enterprise Architecture program. The CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.<br>In the Preliminary Phase you need to define suitable policies and ensure that the company has the appropriate capability to address the concerns of the Corporate<br>Board.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

    "body": "Scenario:<br>Your role is that of Lead Enterprise Architect within a vacation property management firm that has been growing through acquisition. The firm manages over 200 resort properties across North America. Many of the resort properties use the same internal IT systems that they used before they were acquired. Until recently, the only requirement that has been placed on each property is that they use a standard financial reporting system to report their financial results to the headquarters on a weekly basis.<br>The CEO has stated his concerns about the inefficiencies of the current approach and identified the need to change. He has defined a new strategic vision that will enhance the business by standardizing its operations across the network to provide consolidated financial, human resources, logistics, sales and marketing, and yield management. He has also stated that he expects results by the end of the current fiscal year.<br>These changes will provide the company with improved utilization of its capacity and more efficient operations. The addition of a corporate-wide data warehouse will provide analytics that will enable the marketing group to improve its ability to target advertising into key markets to improve yields.<br>The firm has a mature enterprise architecture practice and uses TOGAF 9 as the method and guiding framework. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity.<br>In planning this change, the Chief Architect engaged the services of a well-known consulting firm that specializes in business strategy. An initial study has been conducted to identify the strategic changes needed to implement the CEO's vision. This recently completed with approval of a strategic architecture encompassing the entire firm, including detailed requirements and recommendations.<br>Based on the recommendations from the initial study, the firm has taken the decision to adopt a packaged suite of integrated applications that is tailored to the needs of the hospitality industry.<br>You have been asked by the Chief Architect to justify the best approach for architecture development to realize the CEO's vision.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.<br>The Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9.<br>At a recent meeting, the Architecture Board approved a Request for Architecture Work sponsored by the Chief Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.<br>The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits. Some of the plant managers have expressed concern about the security and reliability of diving their planning and production scheduling from a remote centralized system. The Chief Engineer wants to know how these concerns can be addressed.<br>[Note: You should assume that the company has adopted the example set of principles that are listed and defined in TOGAF 9, Section 23.6.]<br>One of the earliest initiatives in the Enterprise Architecture program was the definition of a set of architecture principles.

    "body": "Scenario: Glacier Ridge LLC -<br>Glacier Ridge LLC is a vacation property management firm that is growing through acquisition. It manages over 200 resort properties across North America. Many of the resort properties use the same internal IT systems that they used before they were acquired. Until recently, the only requirement that has been placed en each property is that they use a standard financial reporting system to report their financials ID the headquarters on a weekly basis. The CEO has stated his concerns about the inefficiencies of the current approach and identified the need to change. He has defined a new strategic vision that will enhance the Glacier<br>Ridge property business by standardizing its operations across the network to provide consolidated financial, human resources, logistics, sales and marketing, and yield management. He has also stated that he expects results by the end of the current fiscal year. These changes will provide the company with improved utilization of its capacity and more efficient operations. The addition of a corporate-wide data warehouse will provide analytics that will enable the marketing group to improve its ability to target advertising into key markets to improve yields. Glacier Ridge has mature enterprise architecture (EA) practice and uses TOGAF 9 as the method and guiding framework.<br>The CIO is the sponsor of the activity. In planning this change, the Chief Architect engaged the services of a well-known consulting firm that specializes in business strategy. An initial study has been conducted to identify the strategic changes needed to implement the CEO's vision. This recently completed with approval of a strategic architecture encompassing the entire firm, including detailed requirements and recommendations.<br>Based on the recommendations from the initial engagement, Glacier Ridge has embraced an Architecture Vision to adopt an enterprise application that is tailored to the needs of the hospitality industry.<br>Your role is that of Chief Architect.

    "body": "Scenario: Sollace Manufacturing -<br>Sollace Manufacturing is a major supplier in the automotive industry, headquartered In Cleveland, Ohio with manufacturing plants in Chicago, Sao Paulo,<br>Stuttgart, Yokohama, and Seoul. Each of these plants has been operating its own planning and production scheduling systems, as well as custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.<br>Sollace Manufacturing is implementing lean manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve the efficiency of all of its production operations. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff. The Sollace<br>Manufacturing Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9. At a recent meeting, the Architecture Review Board approved a Request for Architecture Work from the Chief Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations who is the project sponsor. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation. The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits. Some of the plant managers have expressed concern about the security and reliability of driving their planning and production scheduling from a central system located in Cleveland. The Chief Engineer wants to know how these concerns can be addressed.<br>You are serving as the Lead Enterprise Architect for the Common ERP Deployment architecture project. One of the earliest initiatives in the Enterprise<br>Architecture program at Sollace Manufacturing was the definition of a set of IT principles and architecture principles that are well aligned with the overall enterprise principles. These now need to be updated to address the concerns raised.<br>You have been asked to select a set of principles most appropriate for guiding the team to define a robust solution. [Note: You should assume that Sollace<br>Manufacturing has adopted the example set of principles that are listed and defined in TOGAF 9, Section 23.6.] Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

Then I ensure that there is recognition for the architecture vision project by following any project management and programmed management frameworks used within the organization. I would identify the key stakeholders and engage with them to understand and document their concerns and high-level requirements. This would result in a stakeholder map used to support other deliverables such as the Architecture Vision, a Communications plan and a Statement of Architecture Work. I would then identify the business goals and strategic drivers of the organization and define any enterprise or project specific constraints such as time and resources. I would then define the business capabilities of the organization needed to fulfill those business goals and drivers and their readiness for change. Once complete, I would define the scope, confirm the architecture and business principles and develop the Architecture Vision. Following this, I would define the business case for the architecture project, assess the business risks and produce a risk mitigation plan. I would then define a plan of enterprise architecture work to meet the scope in the desired time line and the resources required and secure the support of stakeholders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"badge badge-success most-voted-answer-badge\" title=\"\" style=\"display: none;\" data-original-title=\"This answer is currently the most voted for in the discussion\">\n                Most Voted\n            </span>",

I would then create a project to define and deliver the architecture vision and the necessary outputs. The outputs include an approved Statement of Architecture Work, refined statements of Businesses Principles, Business Goals and Business Drivers, Architecture Principles, a Capability Assessment, a Tailored Architecture Framework, an Architecture vision, a Communications plan. The Statement of Architecture Work needs to be clear on the scope of architectural work, the resources needed to complete the work and amount of time it would take to complete the work assuming the scope of architectural work is agreed and that all the resources required are available. The final step would be to agree the Statement of Architectural Work with stakeholders confirming the scope, schedule and confirming the availability of the necessary resources.",

I would identify stakeholders their concerns and business requirements then confirm and elaborate the business goals, business drivers and constraints. I would then evaluate the business capabilities and readiness for business transformation and define the scope. I would then develop the architecture vision, define the target architecture value proposition, KPIs and identify and mitigate all risks associated with the transformation effort. Finally, I would develop an Enterprise Architecture Plan and Statement of Work and secure approval from the relevant stakeholders.",

This would be followed by agreeing and establishing the architecture principles. I would select and customize an architecture framework changing any terminology and selecting the right phases and customizing the structure of content and outputs from the chosen method. Finally I would select and implement and architecture tools. The outputs from this work would include an Organization Model for Enterprise Architecture, a Tailored Architecture Framework including method and content, the Architecture Principles, an initial architecture repository, restatement or references to business principles, business goals and business driver, a request for architecture work and the governance framework."

Its largest business is in processors, although it also designs system-on-a-chip infrastructure and manufactures memory chips. A characteristic feature of its processors is their low electric power consumption, which makes them particularly suitable for use in portable devices. As well as licensing its technology, the company has several manufacturing divisions.<br>The company has a mature enterprise architecture practice and uses TOGAF Standard for the basis of its architecture framework. In addition to the EA program, the company has a number of management frameworks in use, including business planning, portfolio/project management, and operations management. The EA program is sponsored by the CIO.<br>The company has defined a strategic architecture to improve its ability to meet customer demand and improve its ability to manage its supply chain. The strategic architecture called for the consolidation of multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications that have been operating independently in the divisions' production facilities. The goal is to replace the functionality of the existing applications with a new ERP product running as a single instance in the company's primary data center.<br>Each division has completed the Architecture Definition documentation required to tailor and configure the environment to meet its own specific manufacturing requirements.<br>The enterprise architects have analyzed the key corporate change attributes and implementation constraints. A consolidated gap analysis has been completed which has identified the gaps across the Business, Data, Application, and Technology domains. Based on the results of the gap analysis, the architects have reviewed the requirements, dependencies and interoperability requirements needed to integrate the new ERP environment into the existing environment. The architects have completed the Business Transformation Readiness Assessment started in Phase A. Based on all of these factors they have produced a risk assessment. They have also completed the Implementation and Migration Plan v0.1, the draft Architecture Roadmap, and the Capability Assessment deliverables.<br>Because of the risks posed by the complexity of the current environment, it has been determined that a phased approach is needed to implement the target architectures. The overall   implementation process is estimated to take several years.<br>You have been asked to recommend the next steps to prepare the final Implementation and Migration Plan.<br>Based on TOGAF Standard Version 9.2, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

    "body": "Scenario -<br>Your role is that of a consultant to the Lead Enterprise Architect in a company that develops photovoltaic technologies for use in large-scale solar power farms.<br>The company has three manufacturing facilities, two in the United States, and one in Southern France. Each of these facilities supplies a different manufacturer that assembles and sells complete systems. The solar panels and photovoltaic arrays are custom engineered to meet each manufacturer's design specifications.<br>A challenge that the solar power industry has faced is the efficiency of energy conversion. When a conventional solar panel overheats, it becomes inefficient and generates less energy. In response to this, the research arm of the company has pioneered the development of a new solar panel design that will produce up to<br>50% more energy than standard solar panels when operating at elevated temperatures. This will allow the production of significantly more useable energy per square meter than from standard solar technology. This new design is ready to go into production.<br>The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture practice that is supported by a cross-functional Architecture Board. TOGAF 9 is used for developing the automated manufacturing process and systems used to design, manufacture and test the solar power technologies they produce. The Chief Information Officer and the Chief Operating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.<br>As part of putting the new solar panel design into production, a pilot architecture project at a single location has defined an updated standard approach for controlling the automated test systems used to perform final quality assurance. The Chief Engineer, sponsor of the activity, and the Architecture Board have approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.<br>Architecture Contracts have been developed that detail the work needed to implement and deploy the new automated test system controller for each location. The<br>Chief Engineer has expressed concern that a uniform process be employed at each location to ensure consistency and high yields.<br>The Lead Enterprise Architect has asked you to recommend the best approach to address the Chief Engineer's concern.<br>Based on TOGAF, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

The chain manages over 500 hotels across North America and<br>Canada, with another 230 hotels internationally in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Unlike other hotel chains, which are often a mix of company-owned and franchised units, each hotel in the chain is an independently owned and operated franchise. Many of the hotels use the same internal IT systems that they used before they joined the franchise. Until recently, the only requirement that has been placed on each hotel is that they use a standard financial reporting system to report their financial results to the headquarters on a weekly basis.<br>The CEO of the chain has stated his concerns about the inefficiencies of the current approach and identified the need to change. He has defined a new strategic vision that will enhance the business by providing its franchisees new support services including worldwide reservations, global, national and regional marketing as well as consolidated financials, logistics, and yield management. This strategy is part of the long-term commitment to enhance the brand image and drive superior revenue for the chain. He has also stated that he expects improved financial results by the end of the current fiscal year.<br>These changes will provide the chain with improved utilization of its capacity and more efficient operations. The addition of a corporate-wide data warehouse will provide analytics that will enable the marketing group to improve its ability to target advertising into key national and regional markets to improve yields.<br>The chain has a mature enterprise architecture practice based in its headquarters and uses TOGAF 9 as the method and guiding framework. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity.<br>In planning this change, the Chief Architect engaged the services of a well-known consulting firm that specializes in business strategy.

The stores operate 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and rely on point-of-sale technology to manage their inventory.<br>Stores place all orders on-line. The back-office systems collect real-time data to support ordering and product selection decisions including the tailoring of product assortment based on sales history, customer demographics as well as the next day's weather forecast. In many cases, several stores are located in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible.<br>An Enterprise Architecture practice exists within the company, with the CEO and CIO as joint sponsors. They have decided to adopt TOGAF 9 within the practice and the first project is to restructure the Enterprise Architecture so that it can better accommodate the changing strategies within the company and also better respond to changes in economic and technical environments.<br>The CIO has stated that the following issues need to be addressed in the restructuring:<br>\u2711 The systems should be able to withstand any unforeseen disruptions which might affect day to day operations. This is highly critical for ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction and maintaining and growing revenue.<br>\u2711 Dependencies between the application components, the application platform, and technology infrastructure should be minimal and well defined. This will facilitate scalability and ease of enhancement of the service offerings.<br>\u2711 The company is adopting the ARTS Operational Data Model and Data Warehouse Model from the National Retail Federation.

    "body": "Scenario -<br>You are serving as the Lead Architect for an insurance company, which has been formed through the merger of three previously independent companies. The company now consists of three divisions with the same names and division headquarters as their predecessors.<br>The lack of integration between the three divisions has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the company was formed. At present, each division maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, and claims information, each division has different ways of defining these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a common web portal, contact center software suite, and document management system. Also the company has selected a single enterprise-wide customer relationship management (CRM) application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the divisions. The application will be used by each of the divisions and accessed by third party partners through well defined interfaces.<br>The Corporate Board is concerned that the new application must be able to manage and safeguard confidential customer information in a secure manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services in cooperation with its partners.<br>The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the implementation team and the migration teams in each division. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Board to oversee and govern the architecture. The company has an existing team of security architects.<br>TOGAF 9 has been selected as the core framework for use for the Enterprise Architecture program. The CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.<br>In the Preliminary Phase you need to define suitable policies and ensure that the company has the appropriate capability to address the concerns of the Corporate<br>Board.<br>Based on TOGAF, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

    "body": "Scenario -<br>Your role is that of the Lead Architect working for a government agency responsible for immigration, customs, and border control. The agency was formed by consolidating several smaller government agencies. The agency has established an Enterprise Architecture practice based on TOGAF 9. The CIO is the executive sponsor and has appointed an EA steering team to oversee the practice.<br>There has been a considerable increase in security requirements and immigration service requests in recent years, which have expanded the scope and size of the operations of the agency. As a result, the existing Information Technology architecture no longer meets the required service levels. A significant Enterprise<br>Architecture (EA) initiative is in progress with the goal to improve customer responsiveness and satisfaction, and improve the overall operational efficiency of the agency.<br>The current EA staff members were internal appointments based on a request from the EA steering team to supply a number of suitable individuals for the EA effort. Collectively, they possess a broad range of IT and business analysis skills. However, the CIO has expressed concern about the diverse range of experience within the team. There is concern that the EA staff may be lacking in some of the critical skills that are required to properly conduct EA activities. It had been assumed that any EA-related skill gaps would be overcome by on-the-job mentoring from the senior members of the EA staff. Each architect was expected to attend a TOGAF training course and participate in other skill development activities.<br>A recent review of the EA program revealed that many EA staff members, despite attending multi-day training courses, were not proficient in analyzing or creating the models and artifacts required for their assigned architecture projects. Stakeholders have observed errors and inconsistencies in artifacts and deliverables being submitted for review.<br>The CIO has asked you to recommend a professional development plan for the EA staff in order to address the findings raised in the recent review.<br>Based on TOGAF, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

The Executive Director of the agency is the sponsor of the EA capability.<br>Since reliable, high-performance, and secure communications are essential to preserving national security, the Executive Director has placed more stringent requirements for the architecture for the upgraded system. It must be able to provide assurance and verification of specific performance measures on the key services that are most crucial for system operation. Focusing on these service-level details and specific measurements will allow more stringent requirements to be enforced in service contracts. It will also provide a high degree of assurance that necessary performance is being delivered and that notifications will occur if any critical service fails to perform as required.<br>A portion of the program budget has been allocated to conduct a review of the EA. The scope of the review is to evaluate the processes, content and governance of the EA capability to ensure that the higher target performance and service levels required by the upgraded system can be achieved.<br>The Chief Architecture has noted that the core EA artifacts that have been used since TOGAF 9 was introduced are not adequate to describe these new capabilities. The artifacts do not have explicit provisions for defining the in-depth measurement requirements regarding specific services required for the system.<br>She has learned that certain services within the current system have service measurement implementations that match some of the new requirements, but they are only used in a few areas.<br>Recent EA efforts at another national agency have produced generalized high-performance communication system models to realize similar requirements in a critical defense system involving secure communications.

    "body": "You are serving as the Lead Architect for a chain of convenience stores, which has over 2000 retail outlets throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The stores operate<br>24 hours a day and 7 days a week and use the latest cloud-based point-of-sale (POS) technology to manage their sales and inventory. Cloud-based POS systems store all user data, including sales and inventory in a remote server.<br>The cloud-based systems collect real-time data to support ordering and product selection decisions including the tailoring of product assortment based on sales history, customer demographics as well as the next day's weather forecast. In many cases, several stores are located in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible. The stores also act as self-service delivery locations for a large online retailer which further increases the number of potential customers entering the stores.<br>An Enterprise Architecture practice exists within the company, with the CEO and CIO as joint sponsors. They have decided to adopt TOGAF 9 within the practice and the first project is to restructure the Enterprise Architecture so that it can better support the existing environment and accommodate future changes of strategy within the company.<br>The CIO has stated that the following issues also need to be addressed in the restructuring:<br>- They need to address problems with data quality and inconsistent data in order to support better decision making and analysis.<br>- The architecture should focus on the needs of the business, not technology.<br>- To remain competitive, new products and promotions must undergo market trials before deployment across the retail chain. Information systems must be able to manage changes and updates without undue delays.<br>[Note: You should assume that the company has adopted the example set of principles that are listed and defined in TOGAF, Section 23.6. You may need to refer to Chapter 23 of the reference text in order to answer this question.]<br>You have been asked to identify the most relevant architecture principles for the current situation.<br>Based on TOGAF, which of the following is the best answer?

The chain manages over 7500 restaurants across 33 countries.<br>Each restaurant in the chain is an independently owned and operated franchise.<br>Many of the restaurants still use the first generation IT systems deployed over 10 years ago. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the chain has stated his concerns about the inefficiencies of the current systems and identified the need to change. He has defined a new strategic vision that will enhance the business including providing its franchisees new support services to help them address the increasing competition from coffee shops. This is part of the long-term commitment to enhance the brand image and increase revenue for the chain. He has also stated that he expects improved financial results by the end of the current fiscal year.<br>The changes will help provide the chain with improved products, including healthier alternatives in the menu, and more efficient operations. The addition of a corporate-wide data warehouse will provide analytics that will enable the marketing group to improve its ability to target advertising and new products to specific regions.<br>The chain has a mature Enterprise Architecture practice based in its headquarters and uses the TOGAF standard as the method and guiding framework. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity.<br>In planning the change, the Chief Architect engaged the services of a well-known consulting firm that specializes in business strategy. An initial study has been conducted to identify the strategic changes needed to implement the COO's vision. This recently completed with approval of a strategic architecture encompassing the entire chain, including detailed requirements and recommendations.<br>Based on the recommendations from the initial study, the decision has been taken for the chain to adopt a packaged suite of integrated applications that is tailored to the needs of the franchise.<br>You have been asked by the Chief Architect to propose the best approach for architecture development to realize the COO's vision.<br>Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

It has manufacturing plants across North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Each of these plants has been operating its own planning and production scheduling systems, as well as custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.<br>The company has an ongoing initiative to improve the efficiency of all of its production operations, and in particular to reduce its carbon footprint. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in energy usage could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in one central data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities.<br>The Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are based on the TOGAF standard. At a recent meeting, the Architecture Board approved a Request for Architecture Work sponsored by the global<br>CIO. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.<br>You have been asked to select the most appropriate recommendation to ensure that the team evaluated different approaches to the problem and clarifies the requirements for the architecture.<br>Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

These provide real-time, highly secure communication of voice, video, and message data to remove locations around the world. The agency has recently received information from intelligence sources that the current encryption protocols may no longer be secure. In response, a program is underway to upgrade the systems.<br>The agency has an established Enterprise Architecture (EA) capability based on the TOGAF standard. The Executive Director of the agency is the sponsor of the<br>EA capability.<br>Since reliable, high-preformcane, and secure communications are essential to be preserving national security, the Executive Director has placed stringent requirements for the architecture of the upgraded systems. It must be able to provide assurance of the upgraded systems. It must be able to provide assurance and verification of specific performance measures on the key services that are most crucial for system operation. Focusing on these service-level details and specific measurements will allow stricter requirements to be enforced in service contracts. It will also provide a high degree of assurance that necessary performance is being delivered and that notifications will occur if any critical service fails to perform as required.<br>A portion of the program budget has been allocated to conduct a review of the EA. The scope of the review is to evaluate the processes, content, and governance of the EA capability to ensure that the higher target performance and service levels required by the upgraded system can be achieved.<br>The Chief Architect has noted that the core EA artifacts that have been in use are not able to describe these new capabilities. The artifacts do not have explicit provisions for defining the in-depth measurement requirements regarding specific services required for the system. She has learned that certain services within the current system have service measurement implemenations that match some of the new requirements, but they are only used in a few areas.<br>Recent EA efforts at another national agency have produced generalized high-performance communication system models to realize similar requirements in a critical defense system involving secure communications. It is possible that these models may be useful for the upgrade program.<br>[Note: You may need to refer to the Content Metamodel chapter, section 30.4 (located in Part IV) of the reference text in order to answer this question.]<br>You have been asked to make recommendations for tailoring the Architecture Content Metamodel to accommodate the requirements of the upgraded system.<br>Based on the TOGAF Standard, Version 9.2, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

    "body": "You are serving as an Enterprise Architect at a large aerospace company. It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aviation products worldwide and manufactures in multiple countries both inside and outside of the European Union. The company has grown rapidly by acquisition and has inherited numerous different procurement processes and related IT systems.<br>Recently, several procurement processes, within the civil aviation business, have had problems related to the timing of purchases, which has led to excess inventory. The Vice President in change of Supply Chain Management has made the decision to consolidate and reduce redundant procurement processes and systems. He has committed to the CEO that the business will move to a \"Just-in-time\" procurement system so as to keep inventory costs low.<br>The TOGAF standard is used for internal Enterprise Architecture activities. At presents, there are no architectural assets in the Architecture Repository related to this initiative. All assets will need to be acquired, customized, or created from scratch. The company prefers to implement commercial off the shelf package applications with little customization. The CIO, who is the project sponsor, has stated that she is not concerned about preserving the existing procurement processes or systems.<br>This project is using an iterative approach for executing the Architecture Development Method (ADM). The architecture development project has completed the<br>Architecure Vision Phase and has started a number of iteration cycles to develop the Architecture. As a packeged application is being considered, the next iteration will include both the Business and Application Architectures.<br>Stakeholder concerns that should be addressed by these architectures include:<br>1. What groups of people should be involved in procurement-related business processes?<br>2. What applications will these groups use once the architecture development is complete?<br>3. What non-procurement applications will need to be integrated with the new procurement applications?<br>4. What are the dependencies between the non-procurement and the new procurement applications?<br>[Note: You may need to refer to the Architectural Artifacts chapter, section 31.6 (located in Part IV) within the reference text in order to answer this question.]<br>You have been asked to identify the most appropriate catalogs, matrices, and diagrams to support the next iteration of Architecture development.<br>Based on the TOGAF Standard, Version 9.2, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",
