The portfolio includes development of travel assistance systems using swarm data from vehicles on the road.<br>The current phase of architecture development is focused on the Business Architecture which needs to support the core travel assistance services that the company plans to provide. The core services will manage and process the swarm data generated by vehicles paving the way for autonomous driving in the future.<br>The presentation and access to different variations of data that the company plans to offer through its platform poses an architecture challenge.

    "body": "Please read this scenario prior to answering the question.<br>You are the Lead Enterprise Architect at a major agribusiness company. The company's main annual harvest is lentils, a highly valued food grown worldwide. The lentil parasite, broomrape, has been an increasing concern for many years and is now becoming resistant to chemical controls. In addition, changes in climate favor the propagation and growth of the parasite. As a result, the parasite cannot realistically be exterminated and it has become pandemic, with lentil yields falling globally.<br>The CEO appreciates the seriousness of the situation and has set out a change in direction that is effectively a new business for the company. There are opportunities for new products, and new markets. The company will use the fields for another harvest and will cease to process third-party lentils. Thus, the target market will change, and the end-products will be different and more varied. This is a major decision and the CEO has stated a desire to repurpose rather than replace so as to manage the risks and limit the costs.<br>The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture practice based in its headquarters and uses the TOGAF standard as the method and guiding framework. The practice has an established Architecture Capability, and uses iteration for architecture development. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity.<br>The CIO has assigned the Enterprise Architecture team to this activity. At this stage there is no shared vision, or requirements.<br>Refer to the scenario.<br>You have been asked to propose the best approach for architecture development to realize the CEO\u2019s change in direction for the company.<br>Based on the TOGAF standard which of the following is the best answer?",

The firm uses Agile product management techniques.<br>The Enterprise Architecture (EA) team within the firm has been operating successfully for several years and has based its work on the TOGAF standard.

The Enterprise Architecture is sponsored by the Chief Technology Officer.<br>You are working with the EATeam Leader to develop a work plan for the overall Digital Transformation project. You have been called in to work on a specific product line, which is experimenting with direct-to-consumer digital products using a third-party platform.

The new platform will be a cross-functional effort between hardware and software teams, with significant changes over the old platform. It is expected to be developed in several stages over three years. The EA team has inherited the architecture for the previous generation hardware and software automotive platform, some of which can be carried over to the new unified platform. The EA team has started to define the new platform, including defining which parts of the architecture to carry forward.<br><br>Enough of the Business Architecture has been defined, so that work can commence on the Information Systems and Technology Architectures. Those need to be defined to support the core business services that the company plans to provide. The core services will feature an innovative approach with swarm data generated by vehicles, paving the way for autonomous driving in the future.<br><br>The presentation and access to different variations of data that the company plans to offer through its platform pose an architecture challenge. The application portfolio and supporting infrastructure need to interact with various existing cloud services and data-lakes in many countries to be able to manage the data at scale.<br><br><br>Refer to the scenario -<br><br>You have been asked what approach should be taken to determine and organize the work to deliver the requested architectures?<br><br>Based on the TOGAF standard which of the following is the best answer?",

The Architecture Board should be satisfied that the method is being applied correctly across all phases of an architecture development iteration. Compliance with the ADM is fundamental to the governance of the architecture, to ensure that all considerations are made and all required deliverables are produced."

The company's mam harvest is lentils, a highly valued food grown worldwide. The lentil parasite, broomrape, has been an increasing concern for many years and is now becoming resistant to chemical controls. In addition, changes in climate favor the propagation and growth of the parasite. As a result, the parasite cannot realistically be exterminated, and it has become pandemic, with lentil yields falling globally.<br><br>In response to the situation, the CEO has decided that the lentil fields will be used for another harvest. The company will also cease to process third-party lentils and will repurpose its processing plants. Thus, the target market will change, and the end-products will be different and more varied.<br><br>The company has recently established an Enterprise Architecture practice based on the TOGAF standard as method and guiding framework. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity. A formal request for architecture change has been approved. At this stage there is no fixed scope, shared vision, or objectives.<br><br><br>Refer to the scenario -<br><br>You have been asked to propose the best approach for architecture development to realize the CEO\u2019s change in direction for the company.<br><br>Based on the TOGAF standard which of the following is the best answer?",
