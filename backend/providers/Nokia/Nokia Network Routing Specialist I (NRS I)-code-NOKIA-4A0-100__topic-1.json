On modular systems such as the Alcatel-Lucent 7750 SR-12 or the 7450 ESS-12, this directory contains two files, cpm.tim and iom.tim, for the SF/CPM and IOM cards, respectively. On fixed form chassis such as the 7750 SR-1 that have an integrated fabric/control and I/O, there is only one file, named both.tim. The cpm.tim image file is the software that is used to run on the Service Router or the Ethernet Services Switch. It is this software that is created and is tagged with a release number. This software contains all the features required to configure and run protocols on the Service Router/Ethernet Services Switch."
