You can drill down multiple levels deep but you only get to use the Instances metric.\n\nIn many web analytics and reporting systems, subrelations allow you to drill down into the data to explore relationships between different dimensions or variables. However, typically, when using subrelations, you are limited to using the \"Instances\" metric, which counts the occurrences or instances of a specific dimension combination. While you can explore multiple levels of detail with subrelations, you often have limited flexibility in choosing different metrics beyond \"Instances\" for deeper analysis."

However, it's common for many tools to limit the number of items to around 30 for the sake of readability and usability. Displaying too many items in a single graph can make it difficult to interpret the data effectively. Therefore, it's advisable to use data aggregation or filtering techniques if you need to visualize a larger dataset."

Duplicated unique visitor counts, cross-website pathing with no incremental cost.\n\nA multi-suite tagged report suite allows you to have multiple separate report suites with their own unique visitor counts, while still enabling cross-website pathing and analysis. This means that you can track and report on unique visitors separately for each of the tagged report suites without sharing visitor data across them. This ability to maintain separate visitor counts and still analyze cross-website paths without incurring additional costs is a key benefit that a roll-up suite (which combines data from multiple report suites) typically cannot provide."

This is because you set the alert to assess changes at the end of every week, and when a significant change like this occurs, Adobe Analytics processes the data and triggers the alert within a relatively short time frame (usually within an hour or so). \n\nSo, option B is correct: **You will receive an alert shortly after the traffic responsible for the spike is processed, which should be less than 90 minutes.**"
