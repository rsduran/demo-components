Customization allows organizations to derive the maximum benefit from COBIT by tailoring it to their specific governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) requirements. Option A is also partially correct, as customization can involve incorporating industry best practices when relevant. However, option B emphasizes the importance of aligning COBIT with an organization's specific needs. Option C, on the other hand, suggests rigidly following COBIT guidance without alterations, which may not be the best approach for all organizations."

This step is typically done after the key design decisions have been made, such as determining the IT governance framework to be used, defining roles and responsibilities, and identifying key performance indicators.\n\nWhile resolving inherent priority conflicts and determining a sourcing model are important steps in designing an IT governance system, they are typically done earlier in the design process, before selecting an implementation method."

Therefore, option C, initiatives that are easiest to achieve and will garner business benefits, should be prioritized first.\n\nWhile option A, initiatives that are the least expensive, may lower the risk due to failure, they may not necessarily have the highest expected business value. Similarly, option B, initiatives with the lowest cost, may not align with the overall goals and objectives of the organization if they do not deliver significant business value.\n\nTherefore, it is important to prioritize improvement initiatives based on their expected business value and alignment with organizational goals and objectives, rather than solely based on cost or risk."

Even though the organization's IT governance has been operating for three years and is achieving desired outcomes, it is important to periodically review and update the IT strategic plan to ensure that it remains aligned with the organization's objectives, goals, and changing business environment. By reexamining the IT strategic plan, the organization can identify areas for improvement, new opportunities, and emerging technologies that can help them to better achieve their desired outcomes. While option A (lowering service delivery costs) and option B (identifying newly emerging risks) may also be important reasons for reexamining the IT strategic plan, they are secondary to assessing improvement opportunities."
