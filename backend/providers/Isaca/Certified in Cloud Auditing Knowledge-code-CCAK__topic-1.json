Those agreements are a major foundation of governance and assurance, because they provide controls on the relationship with the CSP. Cloud agreements or contracts usually consist of service terms (SLA, acceptable use policy, technical support) and legal terms (jurisdiction, dispute handling, remedies). Those terms are the foundation of the shared responsibility model, which is usually not described directly in the contract. In general, cloud providers rely on unified service and do not negotiate their contracts for every customer request. However, large organizations probably will be able to get more changes, and smaller providers probably will demonstrate more flexibility. \n\nSee section 1.4.13 for more information about contracts as a governance tool."

DevOps is no different\u2014with CI and CD, code may be delivered to users within hours of its creation, and it may not be possible to perform complete static analysis or dynamic code scanning. To address this issue, DevOps teams run multiple security tests in parallel to avoid delays. They break down large applications into services to speed up scans as well.\nValidation against known critical issues is handled by unit tests for quick spot checks, with failures kicking code back to the development team.

So, policies and controls are directly implemented in the system in a (semi) automated fashion.\nFrom the cloud compliance program perspective, most of the evaluation on the suitability of policy to effectively manage the risk and align with the governance goal is done via the analysis of audit trails (e.g., logs). \nLogging of activities takes place alongside the development, delivery and integration pipelines to determine who has done what, who has approved what, when something has been tested, when a certain change has occurred, etc. The logs are not the only evidence the assessor will rely upon, but their role is much more central than before."

Having regular discussions with the CSPs on supply chain contractual requirements and activities through risk/KPI reports helps to identify risks that need mitigation. If the requirements are not being levied on the supply chain, then the threat to the customer increases.

Those modifications can have drastic consequences for certain customers and must be monitored to ensure continuity of the customer\u2019s operations. For example, the retirement of a feature might break a key functionality on which the customer depends, or it might impact user-facing controls.\nThe assessor should determine whether the cloud customer has an effective process in place to track and assess the impact of CSP changes in a timely way. The CSP agreement should be checked to determine whether customers are obliged to upgrade to the latest version of the service or if they can continue using the older version. If the cloud agreement allows the CSP to sunset any service within a set time, the customer may need to factor this risk into its own change plans."

This creates the risk that those credentials\u2014which should never be shared\u2014are\nexposed to people who do not have permission to access them. This could lead to the organization\u2019s application or\ndata being vulnerable. Credential scanning tools search source code for credentials to make sure they are not\ninadvertently checked in with code."
