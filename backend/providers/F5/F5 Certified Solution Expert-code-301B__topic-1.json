Missing ClientHello and ServerHello messages: In a resumed session, these messages are omitted as the client can reuse the existing session information.\n\n2. Session ID presence: Look for the \"Session ID\" field in the handshake messages. If present, it indicates that the client is attempting to resume a previous session.\n\n3. Cipher Suite agreement: In resumed sessions, the client and server directly agree on the cipher suite without negotiation, unlike the multiple options offered in a full handshake.\n\n4. Short and fast handshake: Resumed sessions have significantly shorter handshakes as they do not require the full key exchange process.\n\n5. Missing server certificate: Since the server already presented its certificate during the initial handshake, it won't be resent in a resumed session."

It would decrease it if anything as the files  the webservers send are now compressed. Whereas turning caching off wont save any CPU cycles on the F5, but will mean more bandwith usage on the server-side as it will be repeatedly sending that 1 cached file over the network."

This option is useful if the redirect references the same object, changing only the protocol or host name, while the path and name of the requested object remains the same. This setting is useful when addressing the trailing slash redirect special case issue previously discussed.\n\n-Choose Nodes to rewrite redirects when the redirect URI contains a node IP address instead of a host name, and you want the system to change it to the virtual server address.\n\n-Choose All to rewrite all HTTP 301, 302, 303, 305, or 307 redirects to HTTPS, whether or not they match the virtual server.\n\n-Choose None to disable HTTP rewrites.\n\nhttps://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K14775"
