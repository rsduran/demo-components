It's created next to ensure it can be applied to the Virtual Server.\n\n4. **Create the Virtual Server:** The Virtual Server should be created last to reference and combine the pools, profiles, and iRule in a single logical entity."

This is typically done to ensure seamless failover and to maintain network stability when one device takes over the role of another without necessitating ARP cache updates on other network devices. This helps to avoid disruption in network connectivity and minimizes connection loss due to ARP cache refresh delays."

Floating self IP address on VLAN where the packet leaves the system\n\nExplanation: When SNAT automap is configured, it will automatically use the floating self IP address of the VLAN where the traffic leaves the system as the source IP address. This ensures proper return routing for the response packets. The specific SNAT at 150.150.10.11 will not be applied in this case because the automap SNAT takes precedence for traffic arriving at the virtual server."

The first time the systems are synchronized the receiving system will be assigned the same self-IP addresses as the source system.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHaving the same host name can cause confusion in the synchronization process. When synchronizing, if the host names are identical, it may lead to conflicts where the receiving system might be assigned the same self-IP addresses and other critical configuration elements as the source system. This is because the synchronization process might not correctly distinguish between the two systems, leading to potential issues in the network configuration and operation."
