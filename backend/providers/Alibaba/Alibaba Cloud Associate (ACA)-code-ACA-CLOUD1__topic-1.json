Users can choose an instance with their desired specifications, complete the payment process, and start using the instance right away. Cloud service providers handle the underlying physical hardware, including server maintenance, infrastructure scaling, and hardware upgrades, making it transparent to users. This abstraction of the physical infrastructure is one of the key benefits of cloud computing, as users can focus on their applications and services without the need to manage the underlying hardware."

You can use OSS to store the 10GB of images and handle the additional 50GB of image content uploaded weekly.\n\nCDN (Content Delivery Network): CDN is used to accelerate the delivery of static content, such as images and JavaScript files, by caching them at various edge locations. This helps in reducing latency and improving the loading speed for users located around the world. CDN can be used in conjunction with OSS to improve the performance of delivering images and scripts to users.\n\nTherefore, the combination of OSS for storage and CDN for content delivery is a suitable solution to address both the storage and performance issues in this scenario."

OSS provides scalable, reliable, and cost-effective storage for large amounts of data, making it ideal for storing images.\n\nCDN (Content Delivery Network): CDN can significantly improve the performance of delivering images and other static assets to users. By caching these assets on CDN edge servers distributed globally, it reduces the load on your ECS instance and enhances the user experience by serving content from the nearest edge location. This helps in alleviating the slow loading of images and improves overall portal responsiveness."

If you use CDN to access OSS resources, CDN caches the resources on CDN nodes closest to your region and distributes the resources to you from the nodes. This way, you can access OSS resources more quickly at lower costs."

All file uploading methods provided by Alibaba Cloud OSS service will support resuming from the break point.\n\nWhile Alibaba Cloud OSS provides various file uploading methods, not all of them necessarily support resuming from the break point. The support for resuming from the break point depends on the specific method or tool you are using. For example:\n\nMultipart Upload: Multipart uploading, as mentioned in option D, does support resuming from the break point. You can break a large file into smaller parts and upload them separately, allowing you to resume the upload from where it left off in case of interruptions.\n\nPut Object: The \"put\" method, as mentioned in option B, is a single HTTP request and may not inherently support resuming from the break point for large files.\n\nStreaming: The streaming method, as mentioned in option C, is suitable for continuous updates but doesn't inherently support resuming from the break point."

System disk size\n\nIn Alibaba Cloud ECS (Elastic Compute Service), the system disk size is associated with the chosen instance type and cannot be changed independently without changing the instance type. If you need to resize the system disk, you typically have to select a different instance type that comes with the desired system disk size. Other configurations like memory size (Mem size), the number of data disks (Number of data disk), and the size of data disks (Data disk size) can often be modified without changing the instance type, providing some flexibility in resource management."

Object level: You can set access control policies at the object level, allowing you to specify permissions for individual objects (files) within a bucket.\n\nC. RAM account level: You can manage access control and permissions at the RAM (Resource Access Management) account level, defining what users and roles can do with OSS resources.\n\nThe option \"Directory level\" is not one of the standard access control levels in Alibaba Cloud OSS. Access control is typically managed at the bucket and object levels, and you can organize objects into directories within a bucket for organizational purposes, but access control is not directly applied at the directory level."
