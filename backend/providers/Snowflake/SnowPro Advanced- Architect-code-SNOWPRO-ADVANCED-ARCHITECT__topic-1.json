This is because the user's privileges allow them to access the original data without the masking applied. Since the new column does not have a masking policy, it will simply store the data as it was accessed by the user, which in this case is unmasked.\n\nTherefore, the new column will contain the unmasked data regardless of the masking policy on the original column, and no additional masking will be applied to the new column unless explicitly defined."

For many fact tables involved in date-based queries (for example \u201cWHERE invoice_date &gt; x AND invoice date &lt;= y\u201d), choosing the date column is a good idea. For event tables, event type might be a good choice, if there are a large number of different event types. (If your table has only a small number of different event types, then see the comments on cardinality below before choosing an event column as a clustering key.)\n\nIf there is room for additional cluster keys, then consider columns frequently used in join predicates, for example \u201cFROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table2.column_A = table1.column_B\u201d."

It features a central fact table linked to dimension tables, which radiate from the fact like points on a star. This design simplifies queries, improves data retrieval speed, and is highly effective for BI applications where performance and simplicity are key.\n\nWhile Snowflake's architecture can support various data modeling techniques like 3NF (Third Normal Form), Data Vault, and Snowflake schema (which is a variation of star schema with normalized dimension tables), the star schema remains the preferred choice for BI-focused workloads due to its straightforward structure and query efficiency."

It's widely used in data warehousing to optimize for query performance and ease of understanding for end-users. Snowflake supports this model well due to its columnar storage and performance optimization features.\nD: Inmon/3NF: This model, proposed by Bill Inmon, focuses on a normalized structure (Third Normal Form) which is more flexible and reduces redundancy. Snowflake\u2019s capabilities support the normalized model, ensuring data integrity and reducing storage costs.\nF: Data Vault: This modeling approach is designed to provide long-term historical storage of data from multiple operational systems. It supports agile and scalable data integration and changes. Snowflake\u2019s support for semi-structured data and its efficient storage makes it a good fit for the Data Vault methodology."

However, if developers need to work with production data that has specific columns masked (potentially using different views or transformations), a direct copy of the data may be necessary to apply these transformations without affecting the original production data.\nC: When developers require a separate Snowflake account for development and testing purposes, especially in scenarios where they need to work independently and may need to modify the data structure or content significantly, a copy of the production data into the development/testing account ensures isolation and control over their own environment. Zero-copy cloning does not provide this level of isolation between different Snowflake accounts."
