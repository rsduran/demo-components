When Snowflake warehouse cannot fit an operation in memory, it starts spilling (storing) data first to the local disk of a warehouse node, and then to remote storage.\n\nIn such a case, Snowflake first tries to temporarily store the data on the warehouse local disk. As this means extra IO operations, any query that requires spilling will take longer than a similar query running on similar data that is capable to fit the operations in memory.\n\nAlso, if the local disk is not sufficient to fit the spilled data, Snowflake further tries to write to the remote cloud storage, which will be shown in the query profile as \"Bytes spilled to remote storage\"."

A DataFrame represents a relational dataset that is evaluated lazily: it only executes when a specific action is triggered.

Firehose allows defining both the desired file size, called the buffer size, and the wait interval after which a new file is sent (to cloud storage in this case), called the buffer interval. For more information, see the Kinesis Firehose documentation. If your source application typically accumulates enough data within a minute to populate files larger than the recommended maximum for optimal parallel processing, you could decrease the buffer size to trigger delivery of smaller files. Keeping the buffer interval setting at 60 seconds (the minimum value) helps avoid creating too many files or increasing latency."
