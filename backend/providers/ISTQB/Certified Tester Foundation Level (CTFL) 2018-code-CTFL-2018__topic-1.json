Progressive.\n\nThe \"Progressive\" model, which is commonly referred to as the \"Iterative\" or \"Incremental\" model, involves the development of a system through repeated cycles (iterations) and in smaller, incremental portions at a time. As features are added in subsequent iterations, there is an increasing need for regression testing to ensure that previous functionality remains unaffected. Thus, as the project progresses and more functionality is added, the importance and extent of regression testing increase."

It involves the use of a high-level list of items that are to be noted, checked, or remembered, or a set of rules or criteria against which a product is verified. This approach leverages the expertise and experience of the tester.\n\nStatic testing, including reviews, can indeed use checklists, but checklist-based testing itself is more broadly applicable and is specifically characterized by its reliance on the experience and judgement of the tester, guided by the checklist. The checklist serves as a tool in the testing process, guiding the tester's focus and ensuring that key aspects are not overlooked.\n\nTherefore, in the context of the question and the options provided, option B is the most accurate description of checklist-based testing."

If developers rely too heavily on an independent test team, they might not put enough emphasis on quality in the initial development stages.\nc) Independent testers can be seen as the reason for delayed projects: This is a drawback. If independent testing is not well-integrated into the development process, it can lead to delays.\nd) Independent testers can verify assumptions made during the specification of a system: This is a benefit.

In a defect report, the priority level indicates how urgently the defect needs to be fixed. It helps the development team to prioritize their work and allocate resources effectively. Since the defect management tool you are using includes the severity level (Critical), adding the priority level would provide a clear indication of how urgently this particular defect needs to be addressed in relation to other defects."
