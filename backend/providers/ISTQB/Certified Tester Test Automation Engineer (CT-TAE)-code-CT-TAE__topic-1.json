A low level of intrusion is likely from use of existing UI elements, but depending on the solution this might be more complex than a higher level of intrusion.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the focus is on automating the testing of two minor features on a redesigned website, ensuring mobile-friendliness and compatibility across major web browsers. Option A addresses the challenge associated with the level of intrusion required for automation. While a low level of intrusion is expected when utilizing existing UI elements for automation, it may still pose complexity depending on the specific automation solution chosen. Implementing automation that interacts with UI elements may require careful scripting and handling to accurately simulate user interactions and validate the functionality of the features."

The automated tests written with such set of keywords are statically analyzed by a custom tool that shows the presence of many repeated instances of several identical sequences of keywords. The waiting mechanism implemented by the TAS for a webpage load is based on a synchronous sampling within a given timeout: the TAS allows checking a webpage load every X seconds until a timeout value.<br><br>Based only on the given information, which of the following recommendations would you provide for improving the TAS (assuming it is possible to perform all of them)?",

Such automated tests, which will be delivered to the team in charge of maintenance testing, will be used as part of the regression testing and thus they must be as fast and cheap to maintain as possible. Since the regression test suite is expected to grow significantly over time, also the cost of adding new automated tests must be as low as possible. In particular, the number of scripts should be dependent on the size of the SUT rather than the number of tests.

Keyword-driven scripting.\n\nKeyword-driven scripting allows for creating tests by using keywords that represent actions or operations to be performed on the system under test (SUT). This approach abstracts the test logic from the test scripts themselves, making it easier to maintain and modify tests. It also facilitates reuse of test components, which aligns well with the requirement of minimizing the number of scripts and focusing on the size of the SUT.\n\nMoreover, keyword-driven scripting provides a higher level of abstraction, which can make the tests more resilient to changes in the underlying automation tool. This is important given the high risk mentioned of the test automation tool changing during the operational life of the system."
