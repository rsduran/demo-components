This means that the total number of minutes of recording will be 100 days * 10 sessions/day * 100 minutes/session = 100,000 minutes.\n\nAt the high end of the estimated storage requirement, this would require 100,000 minutes * 250 KB/minute = 25 GB of storage.\n\nHowever, the customer may be able to get away with less storage if they use a lower quality recording setting or if they only record certain types of sessions."

Deploy two PVWAs behind a global traffic manager. \n- GTM can serve both as a DNS and load balancer, resolving DNS query than provide the best route to the least utilities server.\n\nB. Deploy one PVWA only.\n- No redundancy.\n\nC. Deploy two PVWAs in an active/standby mode.\n- Don't meet the fastest respond time since only one PVWA is in used.\n\nD. Deploy two PVWAs using DNS round robin.\n- It might be able to respond in time and have multiple servers in place. However, there is no fault detection if one of the servers die. Therefore, traffic will still be send to the dead server which result in access denies. So I will say redundancy is not really there."
