It monitors for any unauthorized access to specified files.\n\nCyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager's Ransomware Protection feature monitors for ransomware attacks by focusing on detecting any unauthorized access to specified files. This approach involves tracking the access and modification of files that are commonly targeted by ransomware, such as documents, images, and other user data.\n\nBy monitoring file access and detecting unexpected or unauthorized modifications, EPM's Ransomware Protection helps identify potential ransomware activity. It aims to detect the early stages of ransomware attacks by identifying and mitigating unauthorized file changes before they can fully execute and encrypt files.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are not the primary methods used by EPM's Ransomware Protection feature to detect ransomware attacks."

A separate set\n\nWhen deploying the CyberArk EPM (Endpoint Privilege Manager) agent to non-persistent Virtual Desktop Infrastructures (VDIs), the recommended practice is to create a separate set specifically for these non-persistent VDIs. This allows you to manage and apply policies differently to these types of endpoints compared to traditional endpoints.\n\nA separate set provides better flexibility and control over how EPM policies are applied to non-persistent VDIs, taking into account their unique characteristics and usage patterns. This approach helps ensure that privilege management is effectively tailored to the VDI environment, without affecting other types of endpoints.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not the recommended practices specifically related to deploying the EPM agent to non-persistent VDIs."
