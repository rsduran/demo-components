So, the original payload that was in the Mule event before the HTTP request is overwritten by the response data.\n\nMessage Attributes: The HTTP response often brings along its own set of attributes. These attributes may include HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Type, Status Code) and other metadata related to the HTTP response. These attributes can be accessed in your flow after the HTTP request.\n\nException Payload: If an error occurs during the HTTP request (e.g., a network error, timeout, or HTTP error response), Mule may set an exception payload in the event. You can handle this exception in your flow, possibly by using an error-handler component or flow.\n\nSo the answer would be C."

DevKit is an annotations-based tool, with a wide set of available annotations to support its features. It also includes connector packaging tools.\n\nMule 4 uses Mule SDK to create custom connectors. Unlike Devkit, Mule SDK is not a code generator. It is rather a plain extension mechanism. Mule SDK also adds support for features like Transactions, Request-Response message sources, Dynamic configurations, Routers, Non-Blocking operations, Classloading isolation etc.\n\nIn Mule 4, Studio 7.x comes with Mule SDK already installed, however it only supports Mule 4.x connectors (and projects in general), because the structure of the project, export format, xml and scripting language are different from Mule 3.x.\n\nUsers must migrate Mule 3.x connectors to Mule 4.x manually, before they can be used in Studio 7.x."

This watermark functionality is valuable and enables developers to have increased transparency.\n* Developers do not need to create code to handle caching; it is all configurable!\n* There are two columns and both are unique but user_id can't guaranty sequence whereas date_time will always be in increasing order and table content can easily be ordered on the basis of last processed date_time.\nSo correct answer is: Set the watermark column to the date_time column"

Also please take into consideration the following: a system as the one described can be used to provide anonymous access to a certain resource, so no matter if the same person access the resource twice, the application generates a unique radomized user_id every time the user access the application. This kind of systems are usefull to generate access tokens so if an unauthorized agent gets an user_id already used, they will not be able to access the resource."

It's crucial to note that \"On error propagate\" generates an \"error,\" unlike \"on error continue,\" which produces a successful message. Since the  listener's default error response configuration is  \"output text/plain --- error.description \" any payload set within this error handling (on error propagate) becomes ineffective. To display the actual payload set inside an \"on error propagate,\" you need to modify the default behaviour. Change \"output text/plain --- error.description\" to \"payload\" in the Listener -&gt; Responses -&gt; error response section - Body."
