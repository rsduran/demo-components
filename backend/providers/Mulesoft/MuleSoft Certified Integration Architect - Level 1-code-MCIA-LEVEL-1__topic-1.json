Service S picks up and processes each message (not sure how much time it may take therefore it is better to have queues in between A &amp; S) .

Thereby, when a flow uses VM Connector to publish content to a queue, Mule runtime engine determines whether to process the message in the same origin node or to send the message to the cluster to pick another node. Using VM Connector facilitates the load distribution across a cluster."

Also, it is not mandatory to create the RAML in API Designer like the option suggests by use of the word \"must\". Anypoint Studio can be used to  create the RAML as well. \nPoint is, you need to publish in Exchange and you need to add the instance ID to your app for API manager to be able to access it."

The Mule application uses the competing consumer pattern among its cluster replicas to receive JMS messages from a JMS queue. To process each received JMS message, the following steps are performed in a flow:<br>Step 1: The JMS Correlation ID header is read from the received JMS message.<br>Step 2: The Mule application invokes an idempotent SOAP webservice over HTTPS, passing the JMS Correlation ID as one parameter in the SOAP request.<br>Step 3: The response from the SOAP webservice also returns the same JMS Correlation ID.<br>Step 4: The JMS Correlation ID received from the SOAP webservice is validated to be identical to the JMS Correlation ID received in Step 1.<br>Step 5: The Mule application creates a response JMS message, setting the JMS Correlation ID message header to the validated JMS Correlation ID and publishes that message to a response JMS queue.<br>Where should the Mule application store the JMS Correlation ID values received in Step 1 and Step 3 so that the validation in Step 4 can be performed, while also making the overall Mule application highly available, fault-tolerant, performant, and maintainable?<br><img src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03683/0002600001.png\" class=\"in-exam-image\"><br>",
